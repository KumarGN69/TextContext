    }","80% of American teens buy iPhones. After I switched to Pixel, I'm convinced Samsung is why..People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy ""an Android"", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* ""an Android"" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.","1) Despite Samsung dominating the U.S. Android market, their devices often face criticisms for clunkiness, excessive bloatware, and intrusive ads, leading many to switch to iPhone or other brands like Pixel for a smoother user experience.

2) The Pixel, representing stock Android, offers a clean interface, single design language, seamless navigation, and no ads or auto-installers, challenging Samsung's market dominance among American teens who are increasingly favoring iPhones over Samsung phones."," Title: Test User Journey - Comparing Samsung Galaxy with Google Pixel for iPhone Switchers

   Objective: To evaluate the user experience of Samsung Galaxy phones compared to Google Pixel, focusing on the concerns of iPhone switchers regarding Android clunkiness, bloatware, ads, and auto-downloads.

   Test Scenario:

   1. **User Profile:** An average, non-techy American teen who has been using an iPhone and is considering switching to an Android device due to various reasons but is hesitant due to perceived issues with Android phones.

   }","Long Post Ahead – My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User.Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn’t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max—at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI’m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I’ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions—especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I’ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just ""Good,"" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine—it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don’t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** – Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** – The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can’t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** – 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** – When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** – It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** – The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** – Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren’t present on my iPhone, even though I’ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent—many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I’m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I’ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn’t lived up to my expectations.I’m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I’d love to hear your thoughts and input—especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I’m overlooking?**\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the **Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding **RAW photo processing**.I’ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in **Lightroom**—they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There’s a **huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I’ve attached **two images of the same RAW file** to show what I mean:📸 **Comparison Images**:  [https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty](https://imgur.com/a/BdOOOty)1️⃣ **First image** → RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2️⃣ **Second image** → The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in **Lightroom**, it looks **significantly worse**, with **excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens **before applying any adjustments**, so it’s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like **Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I’d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go ""Is that child porn?"" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people.

So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer ""only store passwords locally on device"" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable ""Advanced Data Protection"" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself; this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account. So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!! We have a right to privacy.This is the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.","1. The user is unhappy with Google's new Password Manager that requires storage of passwords in the cloud without an option for local storage. They are also concerned about Google's practices regarding privacy and security, particularly the AI scanning of uploaded images and videos for child pornography, which can lead to incorrect flagging and police involvement.

2. The user is considering switching to Apple due to Google's handling of privacy and the lack of local password storage in Password Manager. However, they are hesitant because of the differences in interface between Android and iOS devices. They also criticize Google for making it difficult to opt for local storage and suggest that this is done intentionally to collect more data.

3. The user also points out that Apple's iCloud uses end-to-end encryption by default, unlike Google, which keeps the encryption keys, allowing potential access to user data at any time. They argue that this lack of respect for privacy makes them consider switching to an Apple iPhone.

4. The 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures. This is highlighted as a principle that Apple should adhere to, with the user calling on Tim Cook to make end-to-end encryption the default setting for iCloud data."," Title: Test User Journey for Google Password Manager Privacy Concerns on Android Devices

    }","Geo-nonsense.Hi there Pixel Reddit,I have been a fairly lifelong Apple User except for the occasional flirtation with Android and Pixel phones specifically over the years but the Apple lock in is real.However, I am becoming increasingly annoyed by two things but one more than the others.1. I am sick of Apple locking features to the latest models what seems to be all the time now. I totally understand features that require the additional computational power the new chipset provides but sometimes it feels like there is no rhyme or reason. What is this like on the Pixel lineup? I ask this because generally I update my phone every two years (and therefore skip every second model).2. This is the one that annoys me the most because I see absolutely no reason for it. It seems Apple is getting worse at geoblocking particular features or they are not as demonstrated where I am in Australia. Again, I understand some of the health stuff requires different approvals and totally understand that but some of the geoblocking again makes no sense. What is this like on the Pixel Lineup.There are some other reasons why I am annoyed. I keep a keen interest in AI. The AI implementation has been poor and staggered and I don't particularly like OpenAI as a company. The main reason I have stuck with it so long is that I value their more privacy focused approach with things like E2E encryption on drive, photos etc as well as the iMessage lock-in but keen to hear if the Pixel Lineup has these similar problems before I go and drop some cash on a Pixel, new headphones and change all my subscriptions.","1. The user, despite being an Apple loyalist, is growing frustrated with Apple's practice of locking features to the latest models and geoblocking certain features, particularly in Australia. They are considering switching to Pixel devices due to concerns about AI implementation and privacy but want to know if Pixel has similar issues before making a change.

2. The user is questioning the geo-restriction of features on the Apple platform, specifically in Australia, and is interested in understanding how this compares to the Pixel lineup as they contemplate switching due to concerns about AI implementation, privacy, and potential lock-in issues."," Title: Test User Journey for Geo-Nonsense Issue in Pixel Devices

Objective: To evaluate the geo-restrictions and feature availability across different models of Pixel devices, focusing on the concerns raised by the user.

Test Steps:

1. Acquire multiple Pixel devices (representing various generations and models) to be tested in this scenario.

2. Prepare a test environment with access to different regions (specifically focusing on regions where the user is currently located, such as Australia, and comparison with other regions).

3. Identify key features that are geo-restricted or restricted by model for both Apple devices and Pixel lineup, based on the information provided in the scenario.

4. Test each device to verify the availability of these features. Document any differences observed between different models within the Pixel lineup and compare them against their Apple counterparts.

5. Evaluate the AI implementation across the Pixel devices, focusing on areas such as machine learning capabilities, real-world performance, and update schedules. Take note of any noticeable inconsistencies or gaps in functionality compared to Apple devices.

6. Assess the privacy features offered by the Pixel lineup, including end-to-end encryption for services like Drive, Photos, etc., and compare them against the user's preference for a more privacy-focused approach. Note any potential concerns or limitations that may arise from this comparison.

7. Prepare a comprehensive report outlining the findings of the test user journey, addressing each concern raised by the user and providing recommendations on whether the Pixel lineup is suitable as an alternative to their current Apple devices based on the results obtained."

    }","Google assistant gone completely? Gemini won't open and accept commands..I’ve been a dedicated Pixel user since the Pixel 3, and one of the key reasons I stuck with this ecosystem was the strong integration of Google Assistant. Unfortunately, my experience with the recent transition to Gemini has been frustrating and disappointing.For the past few days, it feels like Google Assistant has been wiped entirely from my phone. When I use ""Hey Google,"" nothing happens except a small green mic icon in the top right corner that indicates something is listening. There’s no beep, no on-screen visuals, and, ultimately, no functionality. It seems like Gemini has taken over, and frankly, it’s failing to provide even the most basic usability I relied on.The Gemini app no longer has an option to switch back to Google Assistant, which makes me think Assistant has been dropped entirely. If that’s the case, it’s frustrating to see such a core feature—one that made Pixel phones stand out—being phased out or replaced with something that feels incomplete.I recently purchased a Pixel 9 Pro, but I’m seriously considering abandoning it entirely and moving over to Apple to see if the grass is greener. Beyond these issues, being a Google Workspace user makes everything even more complicated: many features are blocked or delayed, adding to my frustration.It feels like Google is dismantling the very things that once made it great, and as a long-time Pixel fan, it’s disheartening.Am I doing something wrong? Is there a button I have to press. Let me know please.","1.

    }","Farewell to Pixel after a decade! I am done with unstable unreliable software..I am moving away from Google and transition to Apple, despite the substantial cost involved in switching ecosystems and given I have been a Android/Pixel user for the last 10+ years. I have been a committed Pixel user since its inception, experimenting with every app, accessory, watch, phone, etc. I also used Google Fi for five years.However, a recent incident has prompted me to reconsider my loyalty. The ongoing issue of network connectivity has been a source of frustration, and last week, a new problem arose: suddenly, my META apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook) could no longer access the phone's microphone. While in-app video recording has always been subpar compared to the phone's native camera, this specific issue was unprecedented. All the permissions are checked, no hardware issue and camera app records fine.After consulting various blogs and users facing similar difficulties, I contacted Google. Despite following all the suggested troubleshooting steps, including a factory reset after backing up my data, I encountered a significant setback. I forgot that my WhatsApp backup was encrypted. Consequently, after the reset, I was unable to restore my backup. After several unsuccessful attempts, WhatsApp automatically deleted all backups, causing me to lose precious memories, including voice clips from my late grandfather. And the issue continues. When I contacted Google about it I was recommended to take the phone to a private service center and they couldn't do anything.While I do not blame Google for WhatsApp’s automatic deletion of backups or my own oversight, I am exhausted by the instability of pixel softwares, which can render a device virtually inoperable or constantly dependent on updates. It slows down so fast as well.I expected basic functionality from a smartphone, but recent models, especially since the Pixel 3xl, have been disappointing. The Pixel 6 was notably problematic and I had one replaced under the warranty and it seems this trend persists with newer models.Therefore, I am bidding farewell to the Pixel 7, Pixel Watch, and earbuds. After more than a decade, I am returning to Apple.To everyone else, please ensure your data and backups are secure. Despite my best efforts, the loss of a single WhatsApp backup erased many irreplaceable memories I dearly wish I could revisit.And to Google, I can't comprehend how unreliable your softwares and hardwares are for a company of your size. I would have been the last person to jump off the boat and even if I have done it that means so many more has already left you."," After 10 years as a dedicated Pixel user, I am switching to Apple due to persistent software instability and a recent incident where my META apps lost microphone access, causing the loss of irreplaceable memories.

I had Android from 2008 to 2019; I’m a nerd and I used to flash custom roms, write code for exposed framework etc. Always had top tier Androids that for some reasons only lasted 2 years before getting clunky, laggy and basically impossible to use.In 2020 I decided to tray iPhone 11 since I work with MacBook Pro and iPad Pro and wanted to try the famous Apple ecosystem.Fast forward to present day: felt a bit bored and the iPhone 11 is obsolete so I decide to give Pixel a shot. I buy Pixel 9 Pro, cover and glass protector. I migrate everything and start the day to day use.I can’t wait to try the camera so I take some shots here and there among different features. Macros are outstanding but when I zoom in there are grey lines “impressed” on the photo.Google suggests me to delete camera cache and perform a list of action. On my 3 days old 1200€ phone. Yeah.Then I find another bug: apps like WhatsApp, telegram etc don’t use the microphone from the tws earbuds, no matter what. I discover that Telegram as an option to force it and it works. But other apps don’t have it. Then I remember that I use meet, teams and slack for work and none of them seems to work. I try 3 different earbuds, different brands, nothing works.Oh and the fingerprint doesn’t work. I gifted a Pixel 9 to my wife on day one and she had problems from the beginning. She started yelling at the screen protector and even with the feature for the pressure activated it worked bad. When I got mine I had the same experience: fingerprint didn’t work 2/5 times.At this point I found myself encountering two major bugs on BASIC features: one I solved (even if it is still absurd to me); the other one seems to have no solution except to send the Pixel back to Amazon and buy a brand new iPhone 16 Pro.Oh and last year I also tried Pixel 8 Pro for 2-3 weeks and had the same experience.I don’t know what to think honestly, but this is not bad luck, it is bad design."," Despite a nerd's preference for Android from 2008 to 2019 due to customization, constant hardware issues led to a switch to iPhone 11 in 2020 for better integration with Apple ecosystem.

The instructions below may help a bit but do not fix the problem. The real issue is Android's Doze Mode which is too aggressive and is delaying notifications. Doze Stopper seems to circumvent it.Are you getting delayed notifications on your phone? Try turning off the setting ""Adaptive Connectivity"" (under Network & internet in Android 14). I ~~think~~ thought that fixed it for me. Also check that ""Adaptive Battery"" and ""Battery Saver"" are off.Two months ago I [posted about getting delayed notifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1atgrmf/pixel_8_delayed_notifications_is_there_a_fix/); they'd only show up when I woke up the phone. A popular post, it keeps getting comments from people saying ""me too"". Thanks to a hint [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1bvtkz5/comment/ky3cg1r/?context=3) I learned about the ""Adaptive Connectivity"" setting. I'd never heard of it before. But it was turned on; I turned it off and now 24 hours later my phone has been reliably getting notifications the moment they happen.As a bonus, I *think* this may have also fixed my problem with the weather lockscreen widget showing me in the wrong location. Sometimes I'd get weather for Los Angeles where my IP address is rather than Grass Valley, CA where my phone is. I'm less certain of it but it's plausible.It's not clear to me what Adaptive Connectivity is supposed to do, I can't find clear docs about it. I think it may be a Google Pixel only thing? A lot of web pages talk about it only in terms of cellular, 4G vs 5G. I'm on WiFi almost always and still had notification problems. I don't know what Adaptive Connectivity's intent is but my experience is in Android 14 it means ""break notifications"". My guess is it's some power saving setting that is having the effect of taking the phone offline.Note there's other phone settings that might cause delayed notifications. Adaptive Battery is the big one (I've always had it off). Battery Saver mode may disrupt notifications.Also individual apps all have battery settings. That used to be Unrestricted / Optimized / Restricted and my understanding is Optimized was supposed to let notifications through immediately. The [UI for all that just changed in Android 14 QPR2](https://9to5google.com/2024/03/15/android-14-qpr2-app-battery-usage/) but I think it functions the same. Most of my apps are set to Optimized and are getting notifications on time.Bottom line: turn off Adaptive Connectivity and Adaptive Battery if you are having trouble with delayed notifications.*Edit Apr 7*: after a couple of days I think this change has improved things but not fixed them entirely. Notifications are still delayed sometimes (Gmail at least) but only by a few minutes, not 30+ minutes like it used to be."," Adaptive Connectivity, a setting on Android 14 devices, may cause delayed notifications. Turning it off has resolved this issue for some users. Additionally, ensure that ""Adaptive Battery"" and ""Battery Saver"" are also disabled to prevent notification delays."," Title: Test User Journey for Delayed Notifications on Android 14

Objective: To determine if turning off the ""Adaptive Connectivity"" setting resolves delayed notifications issue.

Preparation:
- Ensure the device is running Android 14 (QPR2)
- Install and launch ""Doze Stopper"" app to rule out its impact on the test results
- Create a set of standard notifications for testing, such as Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.

1. Power on the device and navigate to Settings > Network & internet > Adaptive Connectivity.
2. Verify that ""Adaptive Connectivity"" is enabled.
3. Navigate back to the home screen.
4. Send a test notification (e.g., via Gmail or WhatsApp) and wait for it to appear on the device.
5. Record the time the notification was received, as well as any delay experienced.
6. Go back to Settings > Network & internet > Adaptive Connectivity and turn off ""Adaptive Connectivity"".
7. Send another test notification and record the time it was received.
8. Compare the two sets of data to determine if there is a noticeable difference in the delay experienced before and after turning off Adaptive Connectivity.
9. Repeat steps 4-8 with other standard notifications to ensure consistency in results.
10. Verify that ""Adaptive Battery"" and ""Battery Saver"" are also turned off to eliminate their potential impact on the test results.
11. If necessary, further investigate the role of Adaptive Connectivity by researching its intended functionality and gathering more information from various sources."

I own an iPhone 14 Pro Max. Recently, I had to replace a Pixel 7 Pro due to a screen issue and a faulty charging port. This was the first issue on any of the 5 phones we've had in two years. \[nb, I thought usb c was supposed to be superior to lightning but I think that has proven to be false IRL\]I got a quote to repair the 7 pro.    A technician at U break mentioned that Pixels rank last in durability among iPhone, Samsung, and Pixel. They quoted repairing the 7 Pro at $900, versus $260 currrent price (Feb 2025) for a refurbished one, making repair not economically viable.As a replacement, I bought a refurbished Pixel 8 Pro from Amazon for $414.00.  Examining it, I found it fragile compared to the iPhone. It's lighter which I prefer, but seems a lot less durable.I prefer the Google OS over iOS and want to switch to a Pixel. However, its hard to move away from durability towards fragility.All this aside, there is one factor in favor of pixel fragility.   You can find refurbished Pixels cheaply, with a Pixel 7 Pro costing $279 vs an iPhone 14 Pro Max costing $650 renewed on Amazon as of Feb 2025. This makes replacing a broken Pixel far more affordable than an broken iPhone.  Is this, after all, the reason why google does not even give 2 shits about building a durable phone?","1. The iPhone offers better durability compared to Google Pixels, but refurbished Pixels are significantly cheaper, making replacement more affordable in case of damage.
2. Despite the fragility of Pixels, their lower cost for refurbished models might suggest that affordability, rather than durability, is a key priority for Google in their phone manufacturing."," Title: Test User Journey Comparing iPhone Longevity vs Pixel Affordability

   }","My Frustrating Experience with the Pixel 9: A Cautionary Tale for Non-English Speakers.I was eagerly anticipating the Pixel 9, especially after all the hype about its AI capabilities. This is the first time I’ve seen AI that could actually be useful in daily life, not just as a chatbot. But after just a few minutes of using the phone, I’m already highly disappointed. None of the much-touted features are available in languages like Czech, which is frustrating considering this is the second generation of Pixels officially sold in the Czech Republic. Google's loud claims about AI being accessible in many languages worldwide just don’t hold up here. At least Apple was quite clear about the availability of Apple Intelligence.Here’s a breakdown:**Pixel Screenshots:**  The app opens, but it's entirely in English despite my system language being Czech. Even worse, the AI features aren’t available because it says my system language isn't supported. It doesn't even specify which languages are supported, which is infuriating.**Pixel Studio:**  The app won’t open unless you switch the language to English. Once you do, it functions, but prompts must be in English. This is far from the seamless, multilingual experience Google advertised.**Call Notes:**  This was the biggest letdown. Not only is it unsupported in Czech, but the feature doesn’t even show up in the UI. The same goes for transcription, ""Hold for Me,"" and the ability to record calls. It’s incredibly disappointing to see these features completely missing.**Gemini:**  While Gemini supports Czech (finally, something does!), it's basically just a web-based chatbot with no integration into the phone's ecosystem. There's no connection to Google Assistant, no weather reports, no calendar or Keep integration, and no smart home control. It’s not even connected to the Search. When I asked about a major local fire, it claimed it couldn’t search for it and it told me to use Google Search. Also, ""Hey Google"" isn’t available. Gemini Live isn’t either, but at least Google made it clear that this feature is US-only for now.**Magic Editor:**  This feature is essentially unchanged from the Pixel 8 series. You can ask the AI to fill in gaps in an image or modify the sky, but you can’t write anything down because the option simply doesn’t exist.**Pixel Weather:**  The app itself looks terrible—no animations, an inaccurate weather map, and no AI summarization. It feels like an afterthought.**Other AI Features:**  No transcription or summarization in the Recorder app, and no text proofreading or style suggestions in Google Messages.Before anyone says that the Czech Republic is too small of a market to matter, keep in mind that Google has an official presence here, complete with a Google Store and booths in every electronics shop. If Google is going to spend hours hyping up AI features during they presentation,  they need to deliver—or at least be transparent about the limitations. It’s frustrating and misleading to pay the same premium price as US customers while receiving a fraction of the features. And for Pixel 8 Pro users, there’s literally no reason to upgrade to the Pixel 9.Let this post serve as a warning for anyone who doesn’t use a widely spoken language—think twice before buying the Pixel 9.-Frustrated Pixel fan"," The Pixel 9, despite promises of advanced AI capabilities, falls short for non-English speakers, with limited support for Czech language in key features such as screenshots, Studio app, Call Notes, and AI services like Gemini, Magic Editor, and other AI features. This raises concerns about the device's value proposition for users outside of English-speaking markets."," Title: Test User Journey - Cross-Cultural Compatibility of Pixel 9 Features (Non-English Speakers Focus)

Objective: To identify and document the compatibility of key AI features in the Pixel 9 for non-English speakers, specifically focusing on Czech users.

1. Preparation:
   - Set up a test device with the latest version of Android and the Czech language system settings.
   - Prepare a list of key AI features to test: Pixel app, Pixel Studio, Call Notes, Gemini, Magic Editor, Pixel Weather, Recorder, and Google Messages.

2. Test Steps:

   2.1 Pixel App and AI Features:
      - Open the Pixel app and verify that the system language is set to Czech.
      - Verify if all the advertised AI features are available in Czech. If not, document which languages are supported.
      - Check if the missing features have a clear disclaimer or explanation about their unavailability in non-English speaking regions.

   2.2 Pixel Studio:
      - Open Pixel Studio and verify the language of prompts.
      - Check for compatibility of AI features in Czech.

   2.3 Call Notes, Transcription, ""Hold for Me"", and Call Recording:
      - Verify the availability of these features in the UI and test their functionality if possible (e.g., try to make a call).

   2.4 Gemini:
      - Open Gemini and verify if it's integrated into the phone's ecosystem.
      - Check for compatibility with Google Assistant, weather reports, calendar or Keep integration, smart home control, search functionality, and ""Hey Google"" activation.
      - Test the functionality of Gemini Live (if available) and document its availability in Czech.

   2.5 Magic Editor:
      - Verify if there's an option to write anything down within the AI feature.

   2.6 Pixel Weather:
      - Check for UI animations, accuracy of weather data, and AI summarization functionality.

   2.7 Recorder App and Google Messages:
      - Verify the availability of transcription, text proofreading, style suggestions in the respective apps.

3. Conclusion:
   - Document your findings, including which features are available or unavailable for non-English speakers, any inconsistencies between advertisements and actual product capabilities, and any potential workarounds or mitigations.

I am not sucked into any one ecosystem and, while I have a MacBook, I am not one of those that consider AirDrop this *integral feature that I cannot live without* like you find over at r/Apple.\*\*\*# iPhoneBasically, I have an iPhone 15 Pro. I purchased this when it came out in 2023 — after a few years using an Xperia — because I was so darn happy that Apple finally swapped to USB-C. *About damn time*. Better still, I even purchased 2-years of the full AppleCare coverage (incl. theft), that still has until Feb 2026 before it expires.This means, even though the device is battered and bruised, I really don't care about that and I can just use the phone while it still works — and works it still does! Even has the new Apple Intelligence features and all.And if I break it still in the meantime? Well, an £80 excess fee and a day later I'll just have a new one. Fab.\*\*\*# SamsungThe problem I have with Apple at the moment is the political climate.I am British — Apple is in the process of revoking E2EE cloud storage here in the UK. Not the end of the world, as I have that MacBook to back up locally like in the olden days. But I am also surprisingly charged by the current American administration.Appreciate the UK has been left out of the firing line (so far) but I am so appalled by the attacks on Europe, Canada, and now Ukraine that I kind of just want to purge all American devices from my property. Great excuse (albeit farfetched) for an early upgrade, too.So, I went ahead and bought an S25. Same storage level as my iPhone, size, and even -£100 off. I reckon if I sold the iPhone (with the AppleCare) I could even make a small profit as it's still highly sought after — the cost burden of juggling both these phones isn't the issue here.My last Samsung was an S22, and I really liked it (except the battery). We usually get Exynos here, but the S25 is SD — so I thought this is a killer phone to have right now, that should last.And yet ...I'm hesitating opening the box in its return period...\*\*\*# My problemI'm stalling opening the Samsung mainly because of an upcoming trip to Japan — that just so happens to be on the last day of the return period. This device isn't insured, and so I am a little terrified of taking it abroad — breaking it — and then about -£699 out of pocket without that same insurance catchment I have if I broke the iPhone abroad at the moment.The other thing is that (as I suspect you might agree here) perhaps this was just a bit of a pointless purchase?Like, the iPhone's purchase was accounted for and customer by Apple in 2023. It's a spent product, and I am barely giving Apple any more money today by simply using it. I think maybe I'm just being petty about the Trump administration, especially as it's something so massively out of my control.I guess my question is, am I right to be hesitant about jumping on (what is) such a minimal upgrade, even if the hardware's Korean? Or is the S25 (with SD) actually millions times better than the iPhone I currently have?Appreciate any thoughts here."," The user is torn between keeping their battered but well-insured iPhone 15 Pro and a new Samsung Galaxy S25 due to political concerns, cost considerations, and fears about using an uninsured phone during an upcoming trip.

Let me highlight the points that are annoying me about Android and why I'm considering moving to iOS. I've had a few Samsungs in the past, but I don't like the bloatware and duplication of apps. I really like the vanilla experience and don't want to move to another brand within Android. For me, the only choices are Apple and Google.**Android cons:*** **Unlock:** Face Unlock is very convenient, but only when you are in a well-lit space. I have the PW2 configured to unlock using proximity, but sometimes it doesn't unlock and asks for the PIN. Additionally, when it does unlock with the PW2, the watch vibrates (and you cannot deactivate it). I think FaceID would be more convenient, but the only phones in Android that have it are from Honor, and as I said, I don't want to use any brand other than Google. Also, tilt to wake is a bit inconsistent for me.* **Watch:** Some features are behind a paywall. Recently, I went on a two-week trip and had inconsistent battery life. For instance, on two days, without any apparent reason, the battery drained in only 12 hours, while it usually lasts for 32 hours (I don't have AOD enabled). No permanent ECG reading. I think the Apple Watch offers a more polished experience. Tilt to wake is also a bit inconsistent.* **Battery:** It leaves much to be desired, even though I'm using the Android 15 beta.* **Lack of polishing in some apps:** The App Store has stricter rules than Android.* **Lack of design coherence.****iOS cons:*** Lack of a good voice assistant* Notifications are not as good as Android (but they seem to be improved in iOS 18)* The stock keyboard (and even Swiftkey or Gboard) is far behind compared to Android Gboard* No Revanced (I use Revanced for Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram)* No split screen* No background tasks* No Google Discover* No clipboard manager* No universal back gesture (and also, not having back gesture from both sides)* No possibility to drop down the notifications from the bottom like I have in Android (for one-handed usage)I'm also a heavy Google user (I have a lot of IoT peripherals in my home managed by Google Home: Nest Camera, Chromecast...). So why am I considering this? I have a MacBook Pro as a work computer, an iPad, and a Mac Mini as personal computers, and the integration is good (e.g., shared clipboard, which is even better in iOS 18).

   }","Broken iPhone 11 display: what to do?.My iPhone 11 recently dropped. The damage is about the display and some pixels are dying. At the moment the phone is still usable, because there are only a few black horizontal lines, but I’m afraid the situation may get worse.I would have liked to continue using my iPhone 11 for a couple of years (until it would have get iOS updates), but I saw that the display repair costs about €240. In addition, the battery should also be replaced, as it is now quite worn out. So I wonder if, in case enough pixels die to make the phone unusable, it’s more convenient to buy a new phone. In that case I would have a budget of €700/€800: what do you recommend with this budget? So far I have lived within the Apple ecosystem, but I am open to possible change. Thank you in advance.","1.

    }","A Warning to All: The Perils of Relying on Your Apple ID!.I'm absolutely livid and at my wit's end here. My Apple ID was banned out of the blue, and the so-called ""senior advisor"" from Apple has been downright unhelpful. They claim it's due to ""sending suspicious messages,"" which is absurd—I don't even use iMessage. Their vague accusations have left me in the lurch.I'm racking my brain here because the only thing I can think of is my daily use of a VPN, but it seems extreme for that to cause a ban. Could using a VPN daily be to blame? Since when does protecting your privacy lead to an account ban? It's outrageous! My Apple ID is a lifeline, with countless important accounts linked to it. And now, without any legitimate justification or even a warning, Apple's heavy-handed approach has cut off my access. No discussion, no appeal, nothing!What could be other possible reasons for this? Has anyone experienced something similar? I'm looking for any steps I can take because I have numerous accounts tied to my Apple ID, and it's incredibly inconvenient to have it banned without a proper explanation or a chance to secure my data.**Some updates:**After making some noise and pushing for answers, I was finally put in touch with an even more senior advisor at Apple. Their advice? Write a formal complaint letter.They've provided me with a mailing address to send a detailed grievance. It seems old school, but if it can help rectify this ridiculous situation, I'm all for it. I'm sharing this to let you know that there might be a sliver of hope if you find yourself in a similar predicament.**Now I feel lucky that I've never used Apple's Keychain or iCloud services to store my personal passwords and photos.  If your digital treasures matter to you, you should also use services that can easily diversify your backups.****Some new thoughts:**I later received an email from Apple saying, ""*Your account was closed in accordance with the iCloud Terms and Conditions. I’m unable to provide further information about this case.* "" This contradicts what the advisor hinted at on the call (suspicious messages). I barely use iCloud, enabled EE2E and never used it for sharing or anything unusual. It appears even the support team is uncertain about the reason behind the deactivation as I am.Many people asked me if I sent some messages that could be reported. I really don't use any Apple services for messaging. I use many other third-party platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram. None of them belongs to Apple.Some other folks mentioned that my account might have been compromised due to a weak password. I'll admit it is possible, but part of the blame falls on Apple's frustrating policy that doesn't allow pasting into the password field for Apple ID. This essentially barred me from using a complex password generated from my password manager, forcing me to opt for something more memorable yet less secure. I did enable 2FA though.Another user shared his ban experience. His whole family accounts were banned because his credit card couldn't be used. He tried to link another card 7-8 times which triggered the fraud detection system. I remembered that I also tried to restore a purchase which I bought from r/AppHookup for free previously, I guess somehow this made Apple feel suspicious (due to network issue or anything, idk).What's really concerning is the unique nature of an Apple ID. Unlike most other IDs, it's tied to so many important digital assets like passwords, photos, documents, wallets, emails and linked accounts. And because of Apple's closed ecosystem, backing up isn't so user-friendly.  Being banned without a chance to appeal or rescue the data feels like a nightmare because of the sheer amount of personal data at stake.  Let's all stay aware of how we manage our digital lives and take steps to protect our assets.**Updates 04/08:**I just recalled another detail that might have raised Apple's suspicions. Occasionally, I've downloaded premium apps for free when they were promoted on r/AppHookup. If I found an app wasn't useful, I sometimes uninstalled it right away but still left a 5-star review on the App Store. This hasn't been a regular habit—I've done it with maybe 20 apps in total, never more than 5 in a single day.  However, even if it looks suspicious, it doesn't really breach the Terms of Service, and a permanent ban for such actions seems like an extreme measure, especially when it affects everything associated with my Apple ID, not just the App Store.**Updates 04/09:**Previously I thought I could keep using my devices (iPhone/iPad) even after the ban, but I've stumbled upon a major obstacle—I'm unable to sign out of the banned Apple ID! It looks like I'm locked out unless I'm willing to factory reset and say goodbye to all my data. This is absurd!I contacted the senior support team again, and they told me I have to provide my purchase receipt and erase all data on the device to keep using it. Nonsense again. Since when did the owner of the hardware become Apple again? What if I can't find the receipt  which was 5 years ago? To be clear, no one reported my device was lost.**Final update here:**[https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1cdsqpf/the\_final\_update\_of\_my\_recent\_apple\_id\_ban/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1cdsqpf/the_final_update_of_my_recent_apple_id_ban/)**Some useful links:**[**https://www.apple.com/au/privacy/contact/**](https://www.apple.com/au/privacy/contact/)[https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/08/08/another-user-locked-out-of-apple-account/](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/08/08/another-user-locked-out-of-apple-account/)[https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/07/apple-accounts-permanently-blocked/](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/07/apple-accounts-permanently-blocked/)*I will keep this post updated!*","1.

New job kinda forced/bullied me into must-having iOS... It sucks that way and I hate how I had to scrounge up the marketplace urgently for it (no they did not inform me about this and I had a TERRIBLE first day at the new job because of it).Ended up settling for both the iPad 9th gen and iPhone 8 for cheap. Like dirt cheap. The iPad was to be let go by a nice couple who wanted not a lot for it. It was still new too with limited warranty attached to it. Came with a bunch of cases and a new screen protector. Its not that difficult to say that the iPad 9th gen lives up to its reputation as one of the best tablets around. Its still a powerhouse for both work and play.The iPhone 8 was the cheapest though. Guy wanted nothing more to do with it but went and got it a new battery (with its age, I don't really care if its original, OEM or a generic cheap one). Its at 100% battery health for now. What surprised me was how good this thing is. On low power mode with about ~3 hours of SOT on social media, texts and calls... I come back home with about 70% charge. That's honestly insane. Multitasking is shit on it obviously with the tiny RAM but otherwise it runs modern apps really well minus the longer load times.For comparison, for a while I still used my Pixel 7a and Pixel 8 Pro alongside the iPhone during the work day. The 7a and iPhone have more or less the same SOT and workload but the Pixel always runs our of juice at the end of the day. Even when its on battery saver. It was absolutely no match. I still have to have the Pixel around because the iPhone 8's camera can't take anything worth shit for social media. Maybe the camera is defective by now but it is horrid. Its the only reason why I still have the Pixels with me during work. Otherwise, I think I would be perfectly fine to fully use the iPhone for work.If the new job pans out, I'm seriously considering an iPhone for a work phone next year. Either the SE4 for digital minimalism and work or try transitioning fully into the Apple ecosystem and get a full fledged Pro iPhone.

   }","Apple repair/replace experience.I’m not sure how many of you rely on your iphone for work related stuff, but I do.  I rely on emails, certain professional apps, and verification apps for work.  In other words it’s a huge PITA to transfer everything to a secondary phone.  I have an older iPhone that I keep around that is setup similar to my current work/personal phone so that in case my current model iphone gets damaged I can send it off.  Recently I’ve been struggling with Apple repair services, for months now there has been no replacement device for me, and my local authorized repair places do not have parts nor are they able to secure parts for repair.  Which left me with paying for an Apple Care Plus plan that I’m not able to utilize fully.  And with it expiring in a few weeks very little of it is left to refund.  As much as I enjoy the Apple ecosystem I’m not sure if I’ll be buying even the standard model iphone anymore and probably just stick with the budget models going forward, especially if I can’t get reliable repair services.
