negative,"[' User Experience, Others']","I REALLY wish Google starts using UFS 4.0 instead of UFS 3.1+The read-write speeds are so slow. This alone makes all the apps feel slower and less-responsive. Try editing a photo on Lightroom and export it or try uploading a story on Instagram quickly. My god the entire phone slows down so bad.  Just a quick rant. Out I go.Edit: copium is hard in this sub, as always. the same apps I mentioned work so much smoother on Samsungs, Nothings and OnePlus phones. Keep coping fellas. God bless. "
negative,"[' Others, User Experience, Service']",My Pixel 6 is dead after Android 15 update+I updated my Pixel 6 to Android 15 a few days ago. This morning I'm looking at some press articles and my phone suddenly shuts down. I can't turn it on or do anything.I see that other Pixel 6 users are in a similar situation after installing Android 15.I don't know what to do since my phone is out of warranty.
negative,"[' Audio, Others']","128GB for the Pro models shouldn't even an option in my opinion+I think, it should start with 256 at least. Having pro camera modules with RAM of 12/16GB and just 128GB storage kinda doesn't add up."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Voice Quality']","Unfortunately, after 13 years, I'm leaving team Pixel.+And I know you all don't care (I wouldn't). But I'm not happy that it came to this. I'm in love with Pixel phones, but P8 have a problem (known and well spread) that is making me change the brand.My last Pixel is Pixel 8 (after Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 4a, Pixel 6) and in last couple of months I'm having a problem with me being unavailable for gsm calls (or calls go to voicemail). My dad is terminally sick and I can't afford to lose calls at the moment. Seems there's no fix for this, so have to sell the phone. Don't know what I'm going to get, but something people can call me on, at least. This problem is really something I can't overlook, and will not be getting Pixel again.If you know the fix, which I couldn't find, please save me and help.Cheers friends."
