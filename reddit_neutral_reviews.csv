"Neutral","Pixel 8 March Update Charging Issue.After the March 2025 feature update on the Pixel 8, the ""80% Charging Limit"" feature no longer works. Once the battery reaches 80%, the charging status text at the bottom of the lock screen disappears. In other words, the charging status is not displayed on the lock screen from 80% to 100%.This issue does not occur when using Adaptive Charging.Update: After I charged my Pixel 8 to 100% again and let it trickle charge for a while until the shield icon appeared next to the battery icon, the 80% charging limit started working again. I guess it’s not a bug but rather a battery percentage calibration after a system update. My apologies—I wrongly blamed Google.Note: Anyone experiencing this issue must charge the battery to 100% and then make sure to continue charging until the shield icon appears on the battery icon and the ""Charging Complete"" message reappears at the bottom of the lock screen before unplugging the charger. The trickle charge after reaching 100% is crucial because it calibrates the battery—it’s not a mistake."

"Neutral","Huawei P30 Pro EMUI 11 style launcher for Pixel 8 Pro?.I just purchased a Pixel 8 Pro and was wondering if there's a launcher that does edge launching by dragging the edge of the screen, so you can run multiple apps at once without closing the main app.  For example, I'm watching YouTube and want to respond to a message, I drag from the edge, select the message app, YouTube stays open and keeps playing, then I need to calculate something to respond to the message, so I drag from the edge again, select calculator. After running the numbers, I click the floating bubble to swap back to the messages app, respond to it, then ""x"" out of both messages and calculator. The whole time, YouTube is still open and playing.   I have a screen video showing what I mean but, Images & Video is greyed out for me.  "

"Neutral","Just purchased my first Pixel device but....So I've been using my newly purchased pixel 7 and I'm loving it, but I've realized that the stickers that you are supposed to pull and (cut) in order for the box to be opened were not stuck to the box from one side. Which makes me believe the device was opened or used. I didn't notice any defects or fingerprints when I opened the fox. When I've asked the shop they said the device is brand new could it be that the device is old and maybe it was sitting on a shelve somewhere and the glue got weaker etc? Here are two pictures of the box https://imgur.com/a/4ymjuHm"

"Neutral","Pixel 9 pro XL vs OnePlus 12/13r.I have pixel 6 pro right now. Like the phone overall, but it's been randomly throttling and overheating since day 1 and battery has never been great. I am thinking either one plus 12/13r or 9pro XL.I like big screen phones, great battery life, need 256gb of space and quick and smart device.Good cameras would be a plus but don't care much.Price wise, 9pro XL is absurd. 1000 bucks for 256gb (whoever thought 128gb flagship is a good idea should get fired). The only thing saving the deal is that they would give me up to $270 for a trade in.I never had one plus, not sure if I should get 12 or 13r, or maybe even go for 13 but not sure if it's worth extra money over the other 2.Any advices?"

The Realme 14 xxx will be expensive. Last Moto NEO was also more expensive than before. I expect 3a be 300+ at least and I would idealy like to dodge Xiaomi and curved glass phonesThis is where I am right now :  I found dirt cheap Redmi Note 13 5G 6GB which is just fine for whatever I need just now so its kinda hard to justify getting anything more expensive.  I was considering spending 30% more on G84 for ""better"" OS and more RAM, or 60% more for Realme 12+. Sadly the 13+ did not release here, otherwise thats what I would get.  Yesterday I found 2a for double the Note 13 price, with 8/128 and no expansion so I would prolly have to go for 12/256 as I have no issues abusing the Note 13 and throwing it out in 1-2 years, but the 2a I would prolly like to keep at least 3years."
