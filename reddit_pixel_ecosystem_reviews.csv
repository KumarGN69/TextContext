GooglePixel,Pixel Buds Pro from Airpods Pro user,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/w9jnk5/pixel_buds_pro_from_airpods_pro_user/,"Thanks for posting this. As the owner of a pair of AirPod Pros, Pixel Buds A Series, and soon to be Pixel Buds Pros, this was very relevant to me. 

Outside of my APP's having ANC, Transparency, and wireless charging, I actually prefer the comfort and sound quality of the A Series, plus they work much more reliably on my Pixel than my AirPods do, which often need to be put back in the case once or twice to get both AirPods to connect to my Pixel. I could never quite get the fit perfect either, despite trying all ear tips. They have fallen out multiple times while walking or eating, but that hasn't really happened to me with the A Series.

As such, I'm very excited to have comparable features and better battery life in the Pixel Buds Pros! Hopefully they can improve the transparency a bit, but I'm not too surprised to hear that they aren't as good as the APP's, just because it's crazy good on those. I care more about the ANC anyways, so it is very promising to hear that the Buds Pros have the edge there over the APP.

I will still use my AirPods with my iPad and work iPhone, so now I will have a nice set of ANC earbuds dedicated to both platforms that I use. That should be pretty nice.",8

If they're anything like the other Pixel Buds you can adjust the EQ to increase the bass. It's not perfect but it helps. On my Pixel 6 Pro it's under Settings > Connected Devices > gear icon next to Pixel Buds > Sound

I personally also use a third party EQ app made for Bluetooth to really dial in a better EQ with my Pixel Buds A-Series:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.audiosmaxs.bassboostermusic

It sucks that you have to do any of this, especially with more expensive earbuds, they should come with a good dialed in EQ setting, but there are some things you can do to make the audio quality better.",1

In regards to connectivity, I had the exact same issues that you are, in fact, sometimes I had to unpair and repair my AirPods. Sometimes one side would connect and the other wouldn't, sometimes they would just automatically disconnect and reconnect. Just constant issues, but as you know, they were worth overlooking given the amazing features that the AirPods pros were offering.

For me, when I tried the A series last year, they wouldn't stay in my ears for longer than 3 seconds, and they constantly popped out. So I had the opposite experience in regards to fit. In regards to the AirPods, if I was on a jog, they would definitely be falling out. However, I did buy comply foam ear tips, and I would strongly recommend you do the same, because they make the fit 100% secure. I will be doing the same for the pixel Bud pros as well.

Yes absolutely, if ANC is a priority for you, the buds will blow you away in comparison to the AirPod pros. Very noticeable positive difference. And lucky you, you get to enjoy the best of both worlds!",8

Now turn on AutoEq and it will bring up a search menu. 

-Type in Pixel and you'll see a bunch of options like pixel buds (2017), pixel buds 2020, series-A, etc but nothing for the Pro's. 

-I'm sure it will have them added in a few days. 



If you want to use a present Graphic Equalizer in the meantime, you may need to pay for the app. (I bought it in 2020 so I can't remember). 

-To turn on the graphic equalizer, look under AutoEq and click on the name graphic equalizer. 

-It has a bunch of presets with the default being flat, but you can create your own personal equalizer settings at the bottom of the menu.

And a colossal idiocy of a purchasing decision. Why buy the product, when you already know Google's atrocious record with hardware quality control, including Pixel Buds 1? When you know, before even recieving it and getting QC issues, that Pixel Buds are an awful value compared to alternatives like Galaxy Buds+ (which have far great battery life, better reception, better mic quality, better SQ, and cost $150)?

Hearing the Pixel Buds community in here bitch about the Pixel Buds 2 now, when they during and prior to launch aggressively rebuffed, ignored and dismissed constant explanations from others not to buy them, as they willingly surrendered to mindless consumerism by defending their pre-orders, is funny. It was the exact same thing with the Pixel Slate--there too all the early buyers were doing all sorts of justifications about why it was a ""perfect device"" for them--today, the total number of PSlate owners can fit into a phone booth.

Next time around, understand what you're buying into. It's easy and apparent to see the quality of a product in specification alone, sometimes. PBuds 2 was one of those (even more so, as earphones are reliant heavily on good hardware).

I hope it works out for you, and I can't ever imagine being a US citizen due to shitty reasons like these, where you have next to no consumer rights and live at the mercy of private tyrannies (big corporations). But I can't say I'm shedding any tears for any PBuds 2 owners on this sub, as they were very-well informed.",-1

The pass through was really good for the brief moment I had it on that as well as music and TV on. Will say they definitely seem larger, so if you have little ears it may be a bit tough to keep in.

""Bass lands more clumsily with an excessive, mix-altering ""thump"" quality. Highs and trebles never sit in the correct place. These crucial sonic elements often sound muffled, typically with Buds Pro smoothing over the twinkle of a cymbal or the sharpness of a synthesizer tone.

I know I take LDAC for granted since I can tell a difference with lossless tracks between my Galaxy Buds Pro, AirPods Pro, and my Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros that support LDAC. 

Also no EQ settings is a turn down, since that's why I love my Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros so much. They're normally base-heavy (V curved sound) but with the correct EQ they become one of the greatest sounding earbuds I've used, especially for <$150.

Coming from the Pixel Buds 2, EVERYTHING is an improvement. Pixel Buds 2 at launch was ROUGH.

Call quality is clear and people can hear me well on the other end of my calls.

This my first pair of earbuds with ANC and I'm pretty impressed. My only other point of reference is a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4. The cans are obviously bigger and can do transparency mode better than the Pixel Buds but the Noise Cancelling is like 70% as capable as the Sony's.

I'm blown away by these. The transparency mode is really useful. By far the best I've used on any device (all others were headphones not earbuds). ANC does a great job on the white noise kind of stuff. Sound quality is better than any other buds I have, and I'd be pretty annoyed if it wasn't. 

But it's the level of comfort that really does it for me. It's  something I had no idea was possible. That's in spite of the fact that I could really use a size smedium ear tip. I really forget about them and they really do alleviate the plugged ear feeling. Obviously comfort is totally dependant on your ears.

Music makes a big difference in helping me to focus, and between the comfort and the very good transparency mode these open up a world where I might legitimately wear them all through a workday. This is probably a couple year old news with other manufacturers' offerings, but it's new to me and I'm excited about it.

I'm disappointed that they removed the wing tip to help secure them because there's just a lot of extra pressure on the ear canal. Plus without the wing tip, I'm never really sure that I have these inserted properly either. The Galaxy Buds+ are incredibly comfortable and I could wear them all day.

I don't really listen to the Tab S6 very often, because of the form factor, but when I do sync to it, there is an immediate sound quality difference over the Pixel 5.

GooglePixel,Pixel Buds Pro Review Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/wahko3/pixel_buds_pro_review_megathread/,"I don't have the second gen, but I do have the first gen. Here's my take: The Senny's do sound better. But not by a whole lot. You are getting more fullness, soundstage and detail with the TW's. That being said, I don't like the dark sound profile of the Senny's and I ended up EQing the heck out of them to be more neutral and slightly bright. They handled this EQ perfectly and now I think they are pretty hard to beat in the TW space. A note, I've had these for around 2-3 years.

On to the Buds Pro: 
They're great! Google did a fantastic job here. It's hard to go up against some of the best and be comparable, let alone win. But that being said, I brought out a lot of detail with the Senny's after EQing them, I'm hoping I can do the same here. ANC is a nice bonus and all the new features really make for a better overall experience. 

Personally, I would wait for Wavelet to get updated to support the Buds Pro profile and see what people say then. I have hope they can come close to the Senny's after some tuning.

Conclusion:
For me, I use Audeze LCD-2Cs when I want great sound, so taking a slight hit with my TW Buds I use for walks and stuff isn't a big deal. However, if you have Senny's already, keep them and wait for a Wavelet update and people's opinions on that, unless you plan on using them casually like I do. 

Cheers!",2

GooglePixel,Pixel Buds Pro Review Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/wahko3/pixel_buds_pro_review_megathread/,"I think there's two major contributing factors:

1. Ear tip stem length
2. Earbud shape, particularly the part on the inside edge where it lays flat against your ear

The stem length is short and stubby, and the inside edge is not contoured at all. Google made zero attempt to make these ergonomic and conform to the shape of the human ear. The Galaxy Buds+ have both a longer stem *and* they're more ergonomically shaped, so they're much more comfortable to wear.

So far I haven't been able to wear these for longer than 30 minutes without feeling some discomfort, but *man* the Assistant experience is just so so so much better that it might be worth the pain. Or it might at least be worth forcing myself to try and get used to it.",5

I have a Nest Hub in my kitchen which I use for unit conversions, timers, smart light controls, quick answers to random questions I think of while I'm cooking or cleaning. In my bedroom I have one on my computer desk for the time, weather, smart light controls, setting reminders, etc.. They're just fixtures in my home that provide a certain amount of convenience throughout the day. I don't have to think about using them, they're just there and they work (most of the time). Occasionally they frustrate me as well, sure, but 90% of the time I'm glad they're there. Even just controlling the smart lights in the house with my voice makes me feel like I'm living in the future.

On my earbuds, I use it for answering quick questions, checking my shopping list, setting reminders, checking the name of the song I'm currently listening to, and whatever else I might think of. Similar to the Nest Hubs, the Assistant on the earbuds is just incredibly convenient for whatever I need it for. It's one of those things where it just seamlessly integrates into your daily life and I love it.",5

When I first read that these buds don't have multi-point connection I thought I'd just not bother with them because I'm always using my BT headphones on both my phone and macbook. In fact, the pixel buds set up might be a bit more convenient compared to other devices with muli-point connection. My current Jabra 65t's are great for when you're connected to a computer and then a call comes in and it automatically switches over. but other than that, the multi connect can sometimes be a bit of hit or miss. They'll sometimes not play audio from the device I'm currently using because they're locked into the other device (for whatever reason) and I can only fix this by either disconnecting the other device entirely or playing media from another app to force it to switch over.

At least with a single connect functionality I don't have to worry about the off chance of my buds connecting and playing audio for random stuff/devices regardless of my intentions.",1

I have hope it can be fixed by a firmware update since firmware version 159 had no buzzing for me, but I've seen other people say 159 had buzzing for them and 225 got rid of it, so I don't know.

GooglePixel,First 48 hours with the Pixel Buds 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/gd9icg/first_48_hours_with_the_pixel_buds_2/,I honestly thought this was just how Bluetooth worked nowadays. I have several earbuds/ headphones that just switch over when I hit connect. Didn’t realise I’d been lucky to avoid the old disconnect to connect hassle.,12
GooglePixel,First 48 hours with the Pixel Buds 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/gd9icg/first_48_hours_with_the_pixel_buds_2/,"I think a lot of premium buds will have this sort of feature. There's sometimes confusion about headphones or earbuds being paired and being connected. My Pixel Buds 2 are paired with my phone, my laptop, and my Pixel slate. When I take them out, they're connected to my phone automatically, so if I want to use them on my computer, I go to my laptop's Bluetooth settings and choose to connect them and it effectively ""steals"" them from my phone. 

My TaoTronics over ear headphones don't do this though. I have to go to my phone's Bluetooth menu and disconnect the headphones before I can connect them to my computer, which is already paired. 

I think it never gets highlighted in reviews because this process is supposedly smoother and more seamless with Airpods and iOS/iPad/Mac over Pixel Buds and Android/ChromeOS/Windows (I don't own Airpods to give a fair comparison). As a result, I think if the switching isn't as smooth as Apple's solution, it just doesn't get mentioned. Though I have seen reviewers talk about the ability to pause media on one device and play on another, and the earbuds being able to decide to switch on their own. I personally don't know which have this ability though. 

Sorry for the long response, end of the day, I think the Pixel Buds 2 are great and they're great with multiple devices. To me, they're an easy recommend if you have an Android device, especially since the gestures work on Android, ChromeOS, and Windows, surprisingly.",3

The Airpods and Galaxy Buds do not have the ability to connect to two devices. Maybe that's the deciding factor?


Honestly, I prefer 1 connection at a time. I have Sony extra bass headphones and having 2 devices fight for those headphones gets confusing. I use multiple laptops, a phone, a tablet, and other devices with the headphones. Having to determine where to disconnect it is a huge hassle.

GooglePixel,Pixel Buds 2 case certification,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/fdebhm/pixel_buds_2_case_certification/,"There's a sort of war about perceived value, especially about value being associated with physical objects. I got carried away so sorry for the wall of text...

Generally in the tech world, especially the cellphone world, exploding prices have long been justified by the use of more expensive tech and parts. More ram, better chips, that sort of thing. This has largely been supported and emphasized by the entire industry, even including reviewers and tech journalists. It's concrete, easy to understand, and in it's own fashion, it makes sense as an easy barometer to compare different products objectively. I think the apotheosis of this thinking has resulted in the new Samsung phone that's $1,400 where everyone had started to question if in inflating the specs ever higher was still a trade off worth the price from a user standpoint as that level of power is largely unnecessary. A lot of people can't imagine that price point being a necessary expense if your current phone is usable. Small questions that have nagged at the industry are getting bigger these days.

On paper, Google has much lower specs in their phones, notably the Pixel 3 having less ram then the phones that came out roughly six months before it. After a decade of comparing phones by component prices it feels like an obvious rip off to people.

In what I can see, Google isn't thinking that way in their design ideology at all; in the Pixel line you're paying for experience and software. Google presumably reduces costs by using, for instance less ram or an older processor and makes up for it back end, with a stronger software experience. Love this or hate it, I can see both as it's effectively a fundamentally different approach that I'd argue could get communicated more clearly; paying for experience when the ""product"" isn't visible to the consumer in the same way makes customers distrustful because the number of companies opting for every method of squeezing cash out of the customer. *(See: every software like Microsoft office that moved to subscription models so you can't just buy it and be done for ten years)*

As a pretty casual user of a Pixel 3 that upgraded from an older phone, I don't notice any lack of performance or slow down, though admittedly I'm not a high end customer. Experience wise I've gotten the same experience I might have out of a phone with better specs. So for me, I agree that my experience is stellar and I *feel* like I've gotten my money's worth. But as far as it's physical components, it's not inaccurate to say that the phone is significantly ""cheaper"" then it's competitors. For me though, it's still an insane step up front my old phone!

For Google, the Pixel like is an implicit argument that the physical components are not or should not be why a phone is priced/valued, rather, user end experience, largely supported by software is a better barometer. Who cares if it was more or less expensive to make if the user has an identical experience, and software can scale better across generations as an investment? *(This has the likely intentional side effect of each phone probably having a better profit margin)* 

It's a novel argument and I get it, but it's one a lot of people reject as an excuse to pointlessly and/or greedily price gouge. To be fair to that perspective, it can be easy to look at the phone and see where compromise was made to keep cost down that heavier users than I argue impeded some experiences and usability. In that contrasting view, if the phone cost less to make it should translate as costing less to buy. And to be fair, the Pixel 3 and 4 launched at much higher prices and then dropped off with better sale prices later.

Tl;Dr - The vitriol on either side of the argument is largely an example of an evolving discussion about why phones are priced and perceived rip offs due to different value sets/ideologies in what makes a good phone.",4

Take a look at their Pixel phones. They come out in October/November after most other competition has already released their phones. They never have future facing specs, its always the same shit that we've been seeing for the past year, with for example the Galaxy line, but slightly worse. ""Here's our brand new Pixel!"" but with slightly bigger bezels than everything else, a worse display, slightly smaller battery, a bit less RAM, half the storage capacity.. oh but hey, get it all for ONLY $999!

It does seem like a pretty big oversight (after all, you're **always** gonna fold them by that specific spot!), but I've tried to switch to other, ""truly wireless"" earphones and I always ended up coming back to the Pixel Buds.

For instance, I love how small and practical the Galaxy Buds case is, and it's of course nice to be able to use either of them independently. But sound quality is much worse than the Pixel Buds despite the isolation, battery on the case is 1/4th of the Pixel Buds one, and they're terribly uncomfortable to wear for me.

GooglePixel,Pixel Buds 2 case certification,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/fdebhm/pixel_buds_2_case_certification/,"TLDR at bottom

My original point was that we can appreciate when they are in fact ahead of the curve, like they are with charging on the pixel buds.  A ton of people dog piled in and went with the crappy mob mentally that we seem to have given up on Fighting now days.  We should celebrate when a company does something good not mislabel it as something bad, figure out we were wrong, then say ""yah well they do other crappy stuff so my point still stands"".  

In regard to your other points, yes, I have had hardware envy every once and a while.  I own a 3XL and when I saw the S20 pro drop I loved it.  Then reviews came out and brought me back to reality.  The software is hot garbage and it turns out it's not as friendly as a device as you might imagine due to that over the top hardware.  Such as using a massive sensor with a tiny (mobile phone) lense, the point and shoot ease goes away due to the plane of focus being so small due to the hardware choices they made.  This combined with lackluster software polish, like is always the case, made me loose all lust for the S20 pro.

I am not a ""mobile gamer"" other than some tiny time wasters and honestly I don't know a single person that is.  I know they exist because there are phones targeted at them specifically.  Point being is specs don't sell me a phone. The overall experience does.  Google has me hooked.  This latest feature drop with easy access to the wallet, quick updates to the newest software all the time, ease of use, and a crazy good and fast camera are all I really want in a product.  Now would I like a bigger battery? Yeah probably.  Do I need a faster processors? Nope I have never experienced a slow down on this phone.

Real quick story before I wrap this up.  I bought my pixel 3 and took it to work with me, day 1 people said ""that's cool be wait 3 months and it will lag like hell, the pixel 2 and pixel 1 did it, I'm sure your phone will to"" and here I am a year and a half later with zero issues.  It's a cool and easy thing to hate on them but no one does what I want in a phone better.  1+ caught my eye for a while but it's not the package I want, same with Samsung.  One more quick story.  Everyone shit on the notch on the 3xl before it launched, they often still do.  But whenever I give my phone to friends they say ""wait this is it? I could get used to this in a day"".  I did. Everyone could. People just like pitchforks too much.

This is not even mentioning the life of the device due to actually getting software updates.  

TLDR: it's cool and easy to hate Google, most of it is totally unwarranted. Other companies making ""better hardware"" often fall flat because of software or mistakes that make the hardware inferior in terms of a simple daily driver. Praise a company when they do good. Criticize them when they do bad.",1

GooglePixel,Pixel Buds 2 case certification,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/fdebhm/pixel_buds_2_case_certification/,"Yeah I get where you are coming from but I want to reiterate that I was not ""mislabeling"" something good as bad. I was adding my own thoughts to a comment about google being behind the curve in my own experiences. If it came off as ripping on these buds that wasn't my intention. 

As far as the phone experience goes, yes I agree that Googles software is a much better experience and that's why I have a Pixel phone. Even though that's a personal opinion and not everyone might feel the same. However a majority (if not all) of what you are paying for in the cost of the phone is the hardware. So my point of it being a bad value against the competition still stands. Whether or not its useful to specifically you is not a valid argument.
The Galaxy S10 has better specs than the Pixel 4 in a majority of categories, but they charge the same price. Why does Google give 6gb of RAM when the norm is 8? Why 64gb storage and not 128? Why only 2 cameras when others get 3? a 10% smaller battery. No finger print reader. A consistently worse screen. There is no denying they cut corners and then still go and charge the same price as every other better phone. It feels like a rip off when Google COULD give you the hardware which that money can actually buy, as shown by other phones. Then their software on top of that would be even more phenomenal.

Right now I have hardware jealousy over the S20... if Google would offer their version of a phone like that with Googles software, it would be amazing. However given the trend you cant help but expect the Pixel 5 to have less of everything. Less RAM, less storage, slightly lower battery, the screen to not be quite as nice, the bezels to not quite look as sharp, all for the same freaking price. That's just a bit of a bummer, even for a Google fan. You wait until the end of the year for a phone that just ends up being not as good *as it could be*.

You can say you don't need the highest specs and those cut corners work just fine, however why should you be charged the same price? Google could put better (or at least COMPARABLE) hardware out but they just choose not to. You can pay $999 for a phone with comparable specs to a $700 phone because you prefer it. but that doesn't make it a good value.",1
GooglePixel,Pixel Buds 2 case certification,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/fdebhm/pixel_buds_2_case_certification/,"That's likely due to Google focusing on software advancements rather than hardware, and when it comes to many software related advances, Google is pretty cutting edge. 

Not to be confused with UI advancements, where Google can be hit or miss on catching up (And perhaps there's a reason for that, idk).

Google has some advanced hardware elsewhere, like their WiFi router has some advancements others on the market don't (unless you get to high end stuff which have ax and Google doesn't), Chromecast is/was arguably hardware that was cutting edge, their Webpass service could count, and Pixel stand was cutting edge when it came out.

So I think Google can do it, but for phones they don't, for all we know it's because they have prototypes way early to allow software development for the features to link up well. But it does still suck they're always a bit behind, especially on RAM or storage, which doesn't have a timing issue.",2

Pixel 4a - Reviews: Great for the price. My experience: Not perfect but by far the best experience for a phone I've had at this price.

There's plenty of vehicles that come in with the same issues as other manufacturers. Reliability of a brand means nothing, it comes down to each individual vehicle, each platform, each implementation of that platform, etc. Their total recalls is on par with other manufacturers.

What you're saying is ""the general public consensus is A, therefore A"". I'm not arguing Google's hardware isn't shit 9/10 times, but you can find bad experiences with ANY product and use your reasoning. Hell I don't know how you could ever buy furniture or appliances, there's always reviews of people who got models with major issues.

I think the advice of ""didn't you see people here say bad"" is weak, unless you have some data somewhere that this is a widespread issue. Lots of people rightly complaining on reddit doesn't mean anything if it's within the margin of expected ""defective units"".

Every business worth their salt has paperwork with a literal ""Accepted failure rate"". We don't know how many buds have sold, how many have issues, and what their true and accepted failure rate is.

In a lot of tech sites, though not representive of ordinary people, but do shape perceptions, Google is regarded lower than Facebook which is a complete fail, worthy of CEO removal in my view.",1

I ""liked"" the phone, definitely not love. I came from the Samsung Note series which I originally purchased because Google first got into the cell business then abruptly cancelled developing the pixel line, then later got back into it. Now they ""seem"" fully committed to it. A tech friend of mine had the 7pro so I bought it. I also added insurance to it through Assurant for $9.27/mo. I've used this in the past to cover damage or loss. 

For the first time in my life I lost my phone on a late flight coming home. So thinking I was covered I called Assurant or actually entered a claim online. This is when I found out the insurance does not cover loss like my insurance through Verizon had in the past. It only covers damage and from I've seen online that coverage is in question as well.

I just disputed all of the charges from google. Sorry to hear about your experience. It stinks to be let down by these companies. If you follow their stock prices their behavior seems to fuel better performance which is bad for customers. I've dealt with  Microsoft, Apple and many other tech giants. In many ways they are all the same. Buying quality does make a difference and so far I have an HP laptop that is 10 years old and still works great (except for the disruptive Microsoft updates that deleted and renamed directories and cost tremendous amounts of my time.)! I also have an Apple iPAD that is 7/8 years old and also works great. So there's hope.

At this time, the watch was paired with a new phone. I got the return box for my old phone for credit, but the phone kept getting pushed back.

It was back and forth with 4-5 different support saying it was a mistake, or it was on purpose and I was screwed, and jk again it'll be put back in my account once it gets accepted..and refuses to acknowledge or accept that support and the tracking number said it was delivered to their correct shipping address.


Long story short..their support and their shipping systems is terrible and it honestly sucks.",3

When I first used Apple’s EarPods, I had the same problem of becoming uncomfortable after 15-30 minutes of use, because I was pressing them deeper into my ear to try and maintain a seal.

I disagree. It seems that Apple has released that info, as seen in the Verge's review, where they say the following:
""Apple claims the audio components are virtually the same between the two products (...)""
So there you go, you're paying premium money for features you don't have access to, as the audio components clearly aren't high-grade.

It would be easier for you to just google stuff like ""Best wireless earphones"" and such, but i can name a few which i would personally much rather get.


-  Samsung Gear IconX 2nd gen. 

The 2nd gen has a MUCH improved battery life, and ontop of that these headphones are incredibly feature-packed and water resistant, and you can also use those features with your android smartphone. 
Here is a quote from Tom's guide's review regarding battery life.
> The biggest problem we had with the original Gear IconX was its battery life, which clocked in at a paltry 90 minutes;. (...) Samsung sacrificed the heart rate sensor to extend the battery to 5 hours of Bluetooth streaming and 7 hours of local music playback.

- jaybird X3

These are just a classic recommendation, as they're a good bang for your buck.

- Beoplay E8 

These are exciting new earphones, which are created by the renowned Bang & Olufsen, so sound quality should be great. Furthermore, they're pretty featured packed. I have auditioned these myself, but for a brief moment, so not long enough to make a judgement, but they definitely did not sound bad

- Bose SoundSport free wireless earbuds

I would like to note that i heavily dislike the Airpods, as they are ""earbuds"" and by that i mean earphones that literally just hang in your ear. They don't offer any isolation at all, which i heavily dislike, as it means that every single noise will disrupt my music. This could lead to me turning up the volume, in order to actually hear my music properly over the outside noise, which could damage my hearing with time. Additionally, earbuds don't isolate the other way either, meaning other people will easily be able to hear your music, if you turn it a little bit up. Therefore earphones that actually have silicone/foam tips that go into your ear and isolate is much better, imo. If you want to hear the outside tho, then i think that both the Gear IconX and the Beoplay E8 has a feature that allows the outside noise to come through the earphones.

Edit: Apparently I'm downvoted for going above and beyond, when it comes to recommending alternatives. I suppose opinions that aren't pro-airpods really are damaging for people here. ",-3

I love using wired headphones as the connection is flawless and power is no issue on that end. I have found what seem like good wireless headphones and will test out the purported battery life to see if it matches my use case. I generally won't mind too much if something will last at least a day because I aim to charge things every night.

If my 6P gives up and I have to go with a phone missing a jack for a stupid arbitrary reason then I should test out my options while I still have the option of both. I know about using a dongle but we really should be beyond that by now.

Wireless headphones do have some advantages but having another device reliant on a battery isn't ideal. What I really don't like is not having an easy choice between them. Google has been tending to remove more options recently for the sake of simplicity. Hangouts losing SMS integration, removing the headphone jack, that kind of thing.",1

The X3 and Beoplay E8 isn't wired. The Jaybird X3 earphones are connected to each other with a wire tho, but not a wire to the source. The Beoplay E8 is not wired at all tho, not even between the earphones, they're completely wireless.

You also said you had the Beoplay. Do you mean have alrdy owned the Beoplay E8? I would be pretty shocked if that's what you mean, as they were released very recently.

I do still prefer Android [for now], and you actually hit the nail on the head with exactly the two advantages that it has, that trump everything else for me:

- file management. I don't have much to add to what you wrote - if someone uses their phone for more than just content consumption, iOS is in many cases going to be woefully inadequate.
- customization/home screen ui. I don't care so much about customization in itself - I used to be very into that, but I haven't actually changed my homescreen layout in several years. However, I think the iOS home UI is frankly stupid. I'm so incredibly used to having my apps at the bottom (and it's so much smarter to have it this way with bigger devices), that switching to iOS would be a pain. I'm also very married to *my* particular setup; a vertical launcher, to the icon set that I like, the kustom widget I made and so on. On Android, even while the stock launcher changes, I can always install a third-party one and reproduce my homescreen.

I would very much *like* to have a smoother, better thought-out software experience. I would love to see app quality on Android increase, and I do think the state of the play store is pretty damn embarrassing - although not as much as the disconnect and the non-confortimity even among Google's own apps.   
However, it's the two points above that trump that and all of the other points in favor of ios, for me personally.

There is a thrid one that you didn't really go into:    
I used to be heavily into tinkering with my phone, flashing Roms, customization, automization and so on. I really don't anymore - at this point, I appreciate a simple experience that ""just works"" as it is. I have indeed become the kind of user that could be very happy with an iPhone.    
However, I like knowing, *just in case*, that the option, that freedom to force my device to do *just what I want it to do*, is still there.    
Just in case, I can always sideload an app. Just in case there's a specific functionality for which no app exists, I can always fall back to Tasker. Funnily enough, I just ran into this situation yesterday - after not having had to use Tasker for years, I had a use case for which there was no app that could do it, but Tasker works perfectly. It's the same with UI and UX customization and so on. I very rarely use it anymore, however, I very much appreciate that it's possible.",145

This is the first generation I look at the iPhone and can't really list a ton that I care about personally daily.   Like legit the only I can think of that makes me uneasy is not having USB C, which would be an annoyance but not a dealbreaker, especially with wireless charging.

Way back it used to be things like bigger screens, wireless charging, headphone jacks, SD card slots, lower price, nicer screen tech (high res, etc), but now it's like Android manufacturers have regressed on features and iPhone has advanced all while pricing has raised significantly on Android.

I just can't give this up for the cumbersome bottom navigation. I don't want to reach stuff with my thumb.

But that's not all, I just realized you can't choose default apps on iOS. I can't live without google apps. I would throw my phone on the wall if it opened safari or apple maps when I hit a link.

I come from a slightly different user experience from yours - privacy. I have been doing a lot of research into data/online privacy these days, and I was very close to going back to iOS again to have a Google-free phone that is free from the spying eyes of Google. I really like Apple's stance on privacy, marketing or not, and although I much prefer the freedom of Android, I was willing to give that up for a phone that is Google-free.

However, I flashed Lineage OS 17.1 on my phone, and now my phone is near perfect. It's almost completely Google-free, and for what little Google-apps I have, I can freeze them in a separate partition that has no access to my personal data, using an app called Shelter. I also have access to FOSS apps that are transparent with no under-the-hood trackers, which is simply not possible in iOS.

I do miss the software updates and the smooth 'it just works' user experience of iOS, but that has mostly been solved with Lineage OS. 

Having a de-bloated, Google-free phone with FOSS software is wonderful!

> S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.

Shit like this is exactly the reason I can't switch to iOS, no matter how much nicer other aspects of the experience are.  It's sad really; I'd love to have an 11 Pro and an Apple Watch...but I can't go from having a *small computer* in my pocket to a locked down phone running an OS that is just a glorified app launcher.",5

The first reason to move was the absolutely AWFUL photo management on iOS, it's a completely mess, everything is everywhere, and photos are spread all around different folders, I had problem losing the date of the videos that I took with my iPhone when transferring them to my computer, that was really annoying because I needed the date and hour from them... I had problem with edited photos (photos with wrong date), a mix of folders and photos from camera, WhatsApp, websites, Instagram, Facebook... And those virtual albums are just useful in the phone, then when time to transfer photos come they are useless... The iCloud storage it's a joke also.
Camera quality goes on preference, I prefer the quality in my Pixel 3, but on videos I guess the iPhone does a wonderful job, sadly that problem with transference (maybe a MacBook is needed for perfect result, not my case)

Other reason was productivity... I've Instagram and some photo network app and notifications are always divided by group even if they come from the same app, for example, 10 notifications from Instagram are together and then I have 10 more in another notification...
Setting and control panel are not that intuitive and easy, the reason because I got my iPhone was ""it's way easier to use"" and that's far from the reality... Setting for an app are in the app itself and in the settings area too... That not fast and not intuitive... Some options like auto brightness are deep down phone settings and that option should be on screen setting instead of accessibility... If you do a tour around settings you will find that is not easy or intuitive at all.

Personalization is something that is very limited on iOS, not honestly that is not something that makes you change the OS, I had a very good experience despise the limited way to organize my iPhone, and stock works just fine, I guess I was ready since I got my first Pixel phone, I learned to enjoy what comes from scratch and honestly I never needed to change my launcher, I was used to stock when I got my iPhone, and with almost 4 years using the iOS launcher, when I got my Pixel 3 I was really used and pleased with stock launcher, in fact, Pixel stock launcher it's really really nice, neither Nova launcher made my leave it.

The final point (I've more but I'll end here, I wrote too much) was connectivity; even when iOS has some great app for multimedia editing, I missed the connectivity that Android allows me, and one was the NFC, I use public transport and Android made my life easier, I can charge any public transport card from my phone with just three taps, no longer need to go to the station and charge my card in the classic way.
Transferring photos to my computer is always easy and Google unlimited photo storage makes things even easier, I basically have access to all my old photos and they don't take space in the cloud and that's amazing!, Photo memories from Google are something really cool that photographer like me love a lot (well, we have that in iOS too now, but not work as expected)

With all this I don't want to say iOS is bad, on my experience, isn't bad at all, in fact is great, it have details like Android but it's still a great OS; at the end it comes to personal preference, I guess if you have other Apple devices maybe the experience becomes even better.
 
I'll keep using my iPhone as secondary device, and I've intention to upgrade it, not really sure because they are hell expensive here in my country, even a old iPhone 6 is expensive, try to imagine the 11 Pro.

My recommendation is just try both system and see witch one fills you more; being a tech guy and a experimented photographer that need the best of both worlds that's the recommendation that I can give to everyone; don't allow fanatics or brands make you blind, and you will see that the competition it's really interesting.",2

I'm on an S10+ and the 2 major things holding me back from an iPhone 11 Pro Max are the price and file management. 

I have tons of files on my phone and it would just suck if I had to upload everything to a cloud service first to then download them onto my phone and organize each file there. 
Pricing is also a little insane. I got my S10+ for 700€ 5 months after launch (999€ MSRP). For a 11 Pro Max I'd have to drop 1400€ so pretty much double. As a student I can't reasonably spend that much on a phone, even if the iPhone might last me a little longer, especially with an official battery replacement couple years down the line and the great software updates on iOS.

The regular 11 might be a good compromise for someone like me but I don't think I could go back to a lower resolution LCD after my S10+. Also at 800€ it's still more expensive than the Samsung.

Overall I still think I made a good choice with the S10. GPay, file management and pricing are the factors locking me into place.

To me, an iPhone is best for the ppl who desire as little interaction with the device as possible....but there is a catch to that...i.e. You NEED to pay through your nose to buy the other components of Apple's ecosystem .... probably a MacBook, a lot of dongles, and you always need to be online

No Bluetooth transfer, no file management, no SD card etc. But for the things they both do, sure the iPhone is smoother.

you *can* do that on iPhone. As of iOS 13 there's a function to download any file to the ""Files"" app. It defaults to your iCloud storage (you can choose local storage in Safari settings), idea being - you download a file on the go and pick it up to edit/review on the iPad or Mac later. 

For sharing files with PC the same ""Files"" app can access an SMB network share. Note that lightning port in all devices apart from 2017 iPad Pro models caps out at USB 2.0 AFAIK, so wireless transfer can be much faster.

You can also open any file from the ""Files"" app in any supported app. You have to use the share function and select the app you need, it will open the file right from the files app (or even straight from a network share).",10

If you are that kind of basic user that you can use an iPhone. The moment you start useing weird things (hotspot, file manager, icons on the botton of the homepage, etc.) that it's a pain. iPhone simply can't be be personalizaed in any way.

Also as an Android user, I highly recommend Sony or device with close to stock os. Samsung, huawei, etc heavily change the entire Android experience and I really don't like it.",34

Agreed with your points, and I’m a techy tinkerer like you too. File management is something the Android has had right for a decade. With customization, it is very fun so I do miss that on iOS. However, for me, I would sacrifice that element in return for this awesome experience on this new iPhone 11 Pro (no need to get into detail there, it’s in the post). 

iOS now has “shortcuts” and “automations” that could very well give tasker a run for it’s money, so I hope to see those improving with updates. But yes, you’ve made very solid points in favour of Android.",26

The file manager in iOS 13 is ever so potent as Android file managers are. You can do pretty much anything you would need to do.
One thing, which stays true for sure and comes due to the architecture of iOS and the sandboxing of apps, is that you cannot access files of one application in another. This gets certainly annoying when trying to attach files in Gmail for example, but there are workaround, like searching the file in the file manager and sharing it to Gmail from there.
To sum it up, I would say file management certainly isn‘t a negative/missing point for iOS after all anymore, at least not for 99% of the users.",-8

It works by routing your traffic to a local VPN on your device that filters whatever you want.

They don’t auto-dismiss per say but they move to a hidden menu below your new notifications you can then clear if you want.

I do wish the Notification Center better grouped and organized the hidden notifications though. If Apple is going to bulk hide dozens of notifications it would be nice to have a orderly way of browsing through them. Also the fact that shortcuts always make a notification when auto-running is a pain in the ass.

As a whole though I can see why Apple does it this way. I think it’s a far better way of doing things for the average person who never organizes anything on their phone.

Have a little bezel and made it useful.

But I think the SE bezels are far too fat and the design belongs in 2015. However, for the price, it is still a pretty good phone. It's the first time Apple has released a cheap-ish phone with a flagship performance. But I couldn't deal with the SE's lower res LCD screen right now.",5

Samsung's apps aren't the greatest, but they are far more consistent than Google. And the Google apps can be installed regardless of your preference.

It does come with slightly more bloatware but all that can be disabled and with the ample storage that really isn't much of an issue in my eyes.

yes they do, all the time. even jailbroken, iOS still won't let you do things that have been possible on android from the beginning. it does allow some things many unrooted androids don't, so adding all the ""do""s and ""don't""s jailbroken iOS might come out on top depending on your priorities. but all of those ""do""s come with caveats, the biggest being nonpermanence. the wrong combination of tweaks (few of which document their compatibility with each other) or deleting the wrong file can throw you into a boot loop you can't fix by simply flashing a backup. a server-side update from apple and the tool you used to jailbreak is dead so you can't reapply it when it fails (that's when, not if: you don't have to do anything wrong to cause a failure, sometimes people just go to sleep jailbroken and wake up back on stock). and if your ""permanent jailbreak"" is checkra1n, it's fully tethered. every time your phone shuts down you have to plug it into a computer to run the exploit again

I'm not using MIUI. I've used a new RN8 with MIUI, animations were so laggy, gestures lagged compared to my RN5 with PE

I'm not comparing MY phone to an iPhone

I'm not talking about being responsive. Obviously 120 Hz will feel more fluid, but still iPhone will look more consistently smooth because of the animations. 
I'm talking about how Android animations suck. Not the fluidity and responsiveness. They're just made better on an iOS.

I do find it interesting where he is from the disparity in price though, the iphone 11 pro and samsung s10+ were almost the exact same price here at their base models, the difference being 64 vs 128 storage obviously. That said, it's super easy for me to buy an s10+ for like half the price of an iphone 11 pro right now here as well. You can get an s10+ for several hundred bucks cheaper than the base iPhone 11, actually haha. Which means the iphone overall offered MUCH better value buying up front, but also means you could get a pretty damn cheap s10+ as well, even relatively shortly after launch but especially by now. Of course if you did that now and tried to sell it in 1-3 years you'd still get peanuts for it and if you did the same for the iphone you'd get a good deal back still, but i do think IMO the sweet spot for the overpriced androids is waiting ~6 months and getting a virtually bnib model for half the price.

I went from Nexus 6P -> Pixel 2 XL -> Note 10+, maybe I can shed some light on this.

Stock Android has that butter smooth and fluid experience with zero hiccups, you can really feel this when you use it for an extended period of time. The whole UI experience is totally different. 

I almost never had to restart my Pixel, this just hasn't been the case for me with my Note 10+. Stock Android has all the customization that I want / need without any of the bloat that comes with the Note 10+. I strictly went with the Note 10+ for the superior hardware.",5

Also the UI in general felt more consistent: MIUI/One Ui/etc are more consisten in their ecosistem, but when you start using external apps they are made with stock android in mind, so I feel like the average app is more similar to Stock UI than custom one.

Finally the updates: the more customization there are the easier is to ""make mistakes"" that will slow down the device. On contrary on vendor that use nearly stock android they have more time to optimize everything.

There are advantages to doing things this way - but it's not necessarily *cheaper* for most people. 

Education is not a significant out-of-pocket cost - but it's not free; it's paid for via taxes. A person making the median income in the US is in the 22% tax bracket. The same person would be in the 42% tax bracket in Germany.

Having extra apps installed (even bloatware apps) definitely doesn't slow your phone down. 

I argue that the S20 is the most ""butter smooth"" phone I have ever used simply because of 120Hz. I experience a ""hiccup"" so rarely with Android phones (since the Pixel 1 times-ish) that I just can't buy this ""butter smooth"" argument any more.

I do prefer Samsung Internet's bottom navigation, although I use that nor chrome. I also like that Samsung's apps have a consistent theme, but Google's slowly been catching up. Using Google apps can be used just as well on any Samsung device and disabling apps isn't the worst.

Updates also yes. It's not quite as bad as it once was, but it's still very slow.

Camera, Samsung is usually decent enough, for a layman like me I don't care enough to notice much of a difference.

When it comes to the look and feel of the ROM, however, I think One UI looks a lot better and the navigation options are better. I mainly care for those two, I suppose.

I hate the on-screen buttons. Being able to swipe up in the places they used to be is amazing and I don't think Google offers that option.

More fluent. You have 16 ms window fora a frame, if your CPU chugs and takes more time to do things than, say SD865, then animations are no longer as fluid as they should be. 


>Pixel has more stable frame rate for UI and that's it. Animations are the same, frame rate is stable.

I don't really like stock Android, One UI was a breath of fresh air. 

>iOS has different approach to animations and it's whole UI. It's not the simple ""is faster"". It's about how animations look and feel.

Of course it's not ""is faster"", because it's not faster by any means. 
Some applications have same startup times, some are faster in Android, some are faster on iOS, depends on how they're written, OS is no longer the limiting factor. How they look and feel is entirely subjective.

Very few people have the money/time/care factor to buy and daily drive multiple flagships per year.

In *my* experience, iPhones are the smoothest, but only *just*, compared to Pixels. They do feel sluggish, I think because Apple has built iOS to perform an animation and prevent any additional touches until a couple hundred milliseconds after animation is fully completed. I've played with this a lot, and I've theorised as to why: I'm pretty sure it's because the average user would occasionally tap something on the next screen, after an animation, without realising it and then end up somewhere that they didn't mean to be. I see this at work all the time, and people immediately blame the software, saying ""I didn't do anything; it just happened by itself!"".

Pixels, and stock-like ROMs are, IME, the best balance between smoothness/fluidity and speed. Yes, they top OneUI too. That being said, OneUI is *pretty close* now, so I guess it's just personal preference.

I get the explanation that this layout looks better for notched displays. That isn't a usability reason, and barely even a reason. Left clock definitely looks better when you have no notifications... but does that meaningfully apply to many users a lot of the time?

It's not a big difference, but it's [something I go out of my way](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-xposed-magisk-13-compatible-aosp-mods-system-modifications-for-aosp-based-android-12.4421743/) to enable.

I get home and plug it into my monitor on my desk and Dex starts and viola all my apps pop up still in memory at the same spot.

I used a USB-c hub. I got a 7 port hub so I have 1x USB-c PD power input (powers phone and accessories), 1x HDMI port (connected to a normal 23"" 1080p monitor), 2x USB 2.0 (M+KB), 1x SD card slot, 1x MicroSD card slot, 1x Ethernet port. 

Android Desktop is already in Android. You can try it now on Android 13 IIRC.

Over the years I've read complains about multi-window and one handed mode throwing a  message to disable Talkback  to use them.  What makes  it hard not to believe it is the philosophy on their old Tizen Watches: if an app wasn't made with accessibility in mind, it wouldn't let you run it at all while the screen  reader was active. I hope there is  absolutely nothing left of that philosophy in OneUi 5, but anyway the surest way to know would be for me to buy one of their phone and verify for myself.",21
Android,S23 Review for choosy users,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12rp3x0/s23_review_for_choosy_users/,"I couldn't agree more about the UI design.

Sometimes dark mode was a certain black and other times in other apps Samsung apps it was another black, not to mention it was a pain in the ass to fix the design consistency. 

Samsung is a massive company. We shouldn't have to fix their design just so it looks okay. It should just look good out and be consistent with the box and be tweakable additionally. 


I'll also echo this is why iPhone users think android is only for geeks who like to play with their phone. OEMs like Samsung make that seem almost universally true by basically forcing you to micro manage and maintain everything instead of it just working.

Personally I didn't bother touching android till it got more consistent around android 10. And even then it wasn't even close to iOS. My pixel is as close as Android has ever felt to be being truly cohesive in design.",18

My Pixel (and all other devices) would not charge to 100% until just before my alarm went off each day, so as to prolong the battery health. There’s nothing like this on Samsung. I managed to create something similar using modes and routines, but it’s horrible and requires a lot of manual intervention if you don’t wake up at consistent times (eg. You have kids or work hybrid and sometimes commute).

You have battery protect (limit to 85%). And with a simple bixby routine you can disable it 1 hour before waking up. Even better, you can tie it with sleep mode.

Android,S23 Review for choosy users,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12rp3x0/s23_review_for_choosy_users/,"Good honest review. But I disagree on the part about Samsung's software, OneUI has matured greatly and is way more stable and reliable than any Pixel I've used over the years and I've been using a Pixel along a Samsung for a few years now (Pixel OG/S9, Pixel 4 XL/S10e and now Pixel 7/s23u).

At first, I was greatly annoyed by how different OneUI was since I was so used to the Pixels but over the years, I've appreciate how useful some of the features and add-ons available to Samsung can be.

OneUI launcher is nicer than Pixel imo, because it holds your previous spot without having to scroll all the way back down when you leave the drawer. Pixel launcher is terrible in that you can't delete at a glance or remove the annoying search bar.

My hot takes and angry grievances with Pixel:

Battery life is absolutely dogshit on every pixel I've owned. The 'AI' optimized charging is so useless because it is random AF despite using my routines, it charges to 100% so often at night. Pixel biometrics is absolutely trash. My Pixel 4 face unlocked rarely works, and the same goes for the Pixel 7 under screen finder reader.

Android,S23 Review for choosy users,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12rp3x0/s23_review_for_choosy_users/,"> You can always swap launcher to something like Nova, but since Android 10, that’s going to result in a very clunky experience; devoid of the smooth closing animations that only stock launchers can offer, and with pretty broken multi-tasking. If you care about experience, third party launchers just aren’t really viable any more – the out of the box experience needs to be better.

I feel like not enough people know this but, funnily enough, Samsung are the only brand of Android phone that I know of where third-party launchers **are** usable with gestures. 

The problem with most other Android phones is that they all use the stock ASOP gestures, which do lead to broken animations and lag when swiping up to go home, etc. Samsung, however, [also offer their own variant](https://i.imgur.com/bQqdLJi.png) that allow you to swipe up from each of the three (hidden) navigation buttons at the bottom edge of the screen. 

Not only do these gestures work smoothly with third party launchers with zero lag, but they also free up the sides of the display for additional custom gestures via One Hand Operation+. 

This, plus Good Lock allowing users to replace the utterly useless Android one-app-at-a-time horizontal scrolling recents with functional, vertical scrolling cards, are the main things keeping me with Samsung right now.

This is definitely an issue on your side. I've never experienced this and I think it's a problem that only you're facing and shouldn't be on this list. 

> Bluetooth (Pixel Buds Pro) woes

I have multiple Bluetooth headphones and earbuds connected. I have airpod pros 2, galaxy buds pro 2, Sony wfxm3 and seinheser headphones. 

The sonys and seinheser don't have a good microphone, especially the sonys but the airpods I have had zero issues with callers hearing me. I haven't tested my buds 2 pro yet in a call. 

I don't have the second issue you're talking about. 

I don't have a car with Bluetooth either so I can't comment on that. 

> Call issues

I take multiple calls all throughout the day without any issues, are you sure it's not a carrier issue? 

> Camera

Samsung flagships are notriuos for shutter delay/lag but the latest April update has addressed that and now I can take photos of my kids and animals just fine. 80% of the time the pics aren't blurry or out of focus anymore. 

> After the system switches between Dark Mode and Regular Mode, Apps get stuck in some kind of strange [half-dark-mode](https://i.imgur.com/GWsjLGt.jpg) state where the UI will show half dark and half regular. Often it'll be black text on a black background, meaning you can't read notifications on screen. I’ve never seen this before on other devices.

I've never experienced this ever. Are you sure it isn't an issue with the apps you're using themselves?

> You’ll frequently get a message on your lockscreen telling you that your face didn’t match, next to the unlocked symbol, which only shows because it matched your face. It’s just bad UI.

This is the first time I've ever heard of this lol. 

> Using Hex themes, some icons end up as illegible, being [white icons on a white background](https://i.imgur.com/dfLIem8.jpg) with no easy way to change them etc. And you're completely reliant on the Hex plugin developers to fix [UI bugs](https://i.imgur.com/skmoDHy.jpg), which they don't - at least not for months.

Hex isn't for the average user, certainly not beginners. If you can't hack it then I suggest you stay away from advanced customisations such as this.

if you have a different carrier or live in a different location, then call-dropping is surely a different story.

If you use Samsung's buds or anything different than pixel buds I expect Bluetooth results to be pretty great overall.

if you are like most people and don't want your phone to respond automatically to the OKGoogle command and just call it up with a button, you are unaffected.

and if you are either just taking pictures for fun and not overanalyzing them, or alternatively post-editing your shots, or messing with camera settings ahead of shots, even a little bit, the saturation issue is basically gone.

Beyond those, most of the comments seem to be a personal opinion about launchers and UI, etc. Which you can mostly swap out or correct yourself if you are the kind of person to pay attention to that sort of thing.

No you can't. You can *manually specify a time* for it to disable but you can't actually say ""1 hour before my alarm"". I'd have to change the routine every day as well as my alarm

> Yes it has. It's called ""sleep mode"" inside modes and routines

Nope. This can't be triggered when connected to charger AND at night time. You can trigger it by *charging*, but that isn't quite the same: when your battery reaches 85% under the routine above, it is no longer recognised 'charging' so the routine fails.

> Yes it is, and it's tied to sleep mode on routines.

Nope. Can't cancel it on an alarm going off. You can cancel it on *dismissing* a *specific* alarm. But then I have to specify *which* alarm I want it to be triggered by (and I have several as my work and childcare changes through the week). If I set an alarm by voice at bedtime, that won't trigger the routine. If I am in the shower when an alarm goes off, it will never get dismissed and so my phone will sit on DnD and I won't hear calls.

This is a great example of my point: Samsung's given you all these options to tweak and change, but none of them are quite what you need.

They seem to exempt their own apps, though, as I once talked to someone who was having their email notifications delayed when using Gmail but when they logged into Samsung Mail with the exact same account it had no delay.

I agree with your point on the camera, Pixel is king for fast action and moment shots. It also processes trees and grass very naturally. Samsung over-sharpens too much, and it can ruin the whole picture.

Samsung photos looks really good to my eyes at a glance but breaks down a lot in the regular 12.5mp binned mode, imo the 50mp mode is where it shines, lots of detail and decent processing.

I've been using the xda gcam mod and it's pretty stable, very pleasant detail and processing when you zoom in compare to stock. But pictures tend be too dark for my liking and requires post editing.

The Pixel launcher won't let you do anything. And you can't really use another launcher, not without giving up all the Android animations. Unlike Samsung. If it looks worse to you or others, fine.

Android,S23 Review for choosy users,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12rp3x0/s23_review_for_choosy_users/,"I have set it up with routines but it's just not as good. Example:

I can replicate sleep mode by telling it to only enable DND when overnight AND charging, but the problem is then when the phone hits 85% battery, it stops charging and thus the DND mode disables. Samsung should have allowed us to choose 'charger connected', rather than 'state: charging', but again, this is a great example of them *technically* doing something, but not understanding the user.

You also can't properly recreate adaptive charging, by telling it to start charging to 100% in time for the alarm (one varies every day). Routines can't access alarm times so there's no way to set it. You have to manually specify a time where 'battery protect' will turn off, which means I'd have to manually change the routine every time I change my alarm. What's the point in a routine that takes so much manual work? In reality, I can't be bothered and some days I am getting out of bed before my phone has finished charging.

This is exactly what I mean: Samsung makes you do tonnes more manual work to achieve an inferior result. I'd honestly rather things just worked a bit smarter instead of *having to* micro manage everything manually.",3

Samsung has pass through charging and your phone will always charge to 100 and stop at it. Also, phones anyway charge slower from 80-100, so all in all, it doesn't matter much if it charges to 100 at whatevr time it does. Especially because the stand by I assume is pretty good on S23, so even if it does charge to 100 within 1 hour of your sleep it won't lose more than a couple percent by the time you wake up.",1
Android,S23 Review for choosy users,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12rp3x0/s23_review_for_choosy_users/,"There's a lot of evidence everywhere in research and studies regarding this factor.

Lowering the max charging voltage affects two aging parameters: State of Charge and Time.

A lower max state of charge means slower SEI growth, lower rates of electrolyte decomposition and higher structural stability of the binder holding everything together. Furthermore, metal dissolution can be a problem, but that can be mitigated with doping and surface coatants.

Another very big factor is time spent at higher voltages: the lower amount of time spent at higher voltages, the more cycles the battery will sustain and calendar life will be further improved since other parasitic reactions still happen even when not cycling.

That's why overnight charging is damaging to long term battery health, which is why well implemented fast charging and optimized night charging can provide huge cycle life benefits in the long run.",6

If you look at how much $$$ Google spends and what we get vs what we get from the others, not to mention custom roms done by hobbyists for free, its hard to argue that Google is in any way better.

every single device except for the new tablet has been rooted and custom rom-d out the fuckin ass, but samsung has caught up and does what all the roms do, but as stock

AAC is fine, good even, if well implemented. Android prefers to use slightly better codecs like LDAC and APTX and few to no Android OEMs have bothered to optimize for AAC. So when an Android phone connects to AirPods it will use AAC because AirPods don't have APTX/LDAC but it will sound worse and use more battery compared to an iPhone because Android's AAC support isn't very good.

No, it's because MMS is controlled by the carriers, and each decides how large of a file they'll support.

If all of them stopped their arbitrary restrictions, this wouldn't be an issue in the first place. On Verizon, you can send whatever size MMS you want (I've never hit the limit). But if you're sending to someone on another carrier, *that* carrier will down sample.

Even *worse*, iPhones *on Verizon*, will *always* down sample MMS, giving people the false impression that MMS or Android MMS sucks, when it's really Apple's fault.

With two Verizon phones running Android, I can send 150mb videos, at full quality, over MMS. Have done it for years. I can send that same video to a Verizon iPhone, and when they send it back it looks like shit.

I've done this testing many times.

There's nothing inherently wrong with MMS as a *transport*. The problem is the lack of consistency between carriers, and no standard for the application layer, which becomes responsible for ensuring delivery, error correction, etc.

After all, other than embedding attachments in cell frames (which MMS doesn't do with smart phones anyway, only with feature phones and older phones), it's just hosting files on HTTP servers.",27

You definitely don’t sound like you’ve properly explored the depth of integration apple devices have. 

Some examples:
1. You buy an Apple TV - you hold an iPad or iPhone near to it at setup and it syncs across your account etc. This applies to all their devices - hold one near the other for setup, and it’s getting more developed with UWB. 
2. AirPods auto switch between iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch and you can select them on your Apple TV and it connects with no sync issues etc. This also expands to HomePods - get up the Apple TV airplay menu and all your HomePods and AirPods throughout the house appear and can be easily selected - there is zero fiddling with syncing, Bluetooth, setup menus, they’re just always there
3. You need to authenticate an Apple Pay transaction on your computer, your Apple Watch pops up asking you to double press the side button to authenticate. 
4. You click on ‘send to iPad’ on your Mac and the app opens up on your iPad as an extended screen and you can drag things across
5. You take a screenshot on your Mac with an iPad nearby and the screenshot appears on your iPad to be annotated with the Apple Pencil. 
6. Hold and iPhone near a HomePod and it vibrates and ‘peeks’ an interface on your phone that pops up fully when you’re close enough using UWB. 
7. You get a call, it comes through on your iPad, Mac, phone, watch. You can answer on any of them, switch, and you can get up the audio menu and can switch the audio to any of the devices, HomePods, AirPods etc during the call
8. Something is playing on your phone/HomePods/Apple TV and the play controls appear on your watch 
9. You can’t be bothered to find your Apple TV remote, the remote with Siri support is built into your iPad/iPhone with all the features in control centre. This also works in that you go on a text field on Apple TV and a notification pops up on your iPhone/iPad and you can expand the notification and type it there and it appears on the tv. 
10. Universal control, when it finally comes out, allowing the cursor to move between multiple devices and OS’s (not just an extended screen) with drag and drop support looks to be the ultimate flex of properly developed ecosystem features 

There are lots more subtle things like this that are very complicated on the backend and just ‘work’ that you wouldn’t even know existed without actually properly getting into the ecosystem and living with it for a while. To do most of these with Google is either impossible, complicated, a fudge, requires multiple logins, has to be setup, or is just laggy and doesn’t work half the time. 

I also think HomeKit is more stable and versatile (via shortcuts) than Google Home (I’ve got some Nest devices as well as Hue lights, Ikea tradfir plugs etc synced to both Google home and apple HomeKit) - the only real advantage to Google home is there are more devices certified to work with it.

Android,2 Years with the OnePlus 7 Pro - An In-Depth OnePlus/Android Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/oxflx0/2_years_with_the_oneplus_7_pro_an_indepth/,"I've also been using the OnePlus 7 Pro for 2 years now. Bought it at launch when my OnePlus 3 was no longer worthy of a daily driver due to severe overheating, very slow and a battery that could only hold a charge for 2 hours, I decided that the 7 Pro was a perfect upgrade at the time. Do note that I have a OnePlus 9 Pro in my pocket as well, so at the moment I can compare the 2 phones.

I just want to have a friendly conversation about some of the points that you're making, as well as adding some more information from a different kind of user to this review.

Camera:

Yes, I agree that the cameras aren't perfect and agree with a lot of points that you said about them. However at launch they were much worse than they are now. They improved them a lot in terms of color calibration, less noise and better sunlight performance. Yes, the color calibration is different between the 3 lenses but the versatility overcomes this in my opinion, especially for a 1st gen triple camera setup. Compared to the 9 Pro, the 7 Pro's main 48mpx camera holds up really well, only losing out when it's dark or when having to photograph shadows in bright surroundings.

Display:

I missed something in your review. How it handles itself as a multimedia device. I am one of those users that doesn't care about the battery life, so I have both QHD, as well as 90Hz enabled ever since I owned the 7 Pro. 

For media consumption, this is the best phone out there. The screen is beautiful, easily calibrated manually to your liking in the settings, as well that it has a great set of dual speakers with Dolby sound. It is the best phone to watch movies on, hands down. My 9 Pro can't do this, as it has a hole punch. Yes, it has a nicer display with 120Hz, but as a pure movie watching machine, the 7 Pro is better. As for scrolling on social media, browsing the web, etc, the 7 Pro's 90Hz is a must for me nowadays. However this brings me to something that I missed in your review entirely...

Speed:

As someone that does care about speed, I can safely say that the 7 Pro is pretty much still as fast as at launch. The only thing that has changed are the system animations, which slowed those down a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary. I missed this entirely in your review. Speed isn't just for games, it's about the entire experience. How fast it opens apps, how fast it opens a webpage, that all adds up to the experience, and OnePlus bags on that a lot. You only know that it is 'slower' than newer flagships (aka the 9 Pro in my experience) when holding them side by side and opening the same app at the same time. And even then, it's not that you're having to wait 3 seconds longer to open an app like Instagram. The difference is minimal. It just feels fast. OnePlus banks on their speedy experience and is one of their main selling points. However if (like you) you don't care about that, then there are better phones to buy if you'd ask me; Galaxy S10 for instance.

Software, OxygenOS and updates:

I know that compared to iOS, that update speeds are not up to par. And I agree with that, it sucks. You pay a lot of money for a sub-par update experience.

What I wanted to add to your review, is something else that I missed: bugs and stability.

When I first got the 7 Pro, now over 2 years ago, it had OxygenOS 9 (aka Android 9) running on it. It was an absolute charm. Probably the best experience that I've had on an Android device... 

Until Android 10 came along. God that was an awful update. Countless bugs, stability issues, but most annoying was the fact that I went from 8-10 hours of SOT on a single charge, to 5-6 hours of SOT, with the exact same usage. Mind you, I am one of those users that if I'm not using Bluetooth or mobile data actively, I turn it off to save battery. I instantly lost 30-40% of my charge just by upgrading to Android 10. That really angered me but not enough to jump back to Android 9. Android 10 only brought 1 good thing in my experience, system wide dark mode. The rest of it was worse compared to Android 9. It was less smooth, had many bugs that weren't fixed until the release of Android 11 (making it over a year to fix tiny bugs). It was so bad, I've never seen this amount of bugs before on stable software. 

I am one of those users that when I see a bug, I report it to the developers. The process itself is nothing special, but the lack of response by the bug hunters, as well as that bugs that were present at the beginning of Android 10 weren't fixed until the release of Android 11, really made it tough to swallow.

Android 11 has been a bit of a mixed bag so far but definitely better than Android 10. Wether you like or dislike the new style, let's leave that aside. On the one hand, pretty much all bugs that got introduced in Android 10 have been fixed. The phone's performance hasn't yet been there though, until 11.0.2.1 (which is the latest stable update for Europe/unlocked phones). Now it is smooth, fast and the battery is better than on previous A10 and A11 builds.

Feature wise though, OxygenOS is everything that I want, can't complain about that. Double tap to wake and skipping tracks while the screen is turned off are freaking amazing, I love the gestures (and that I can turn off the navigation bar at the bottom) and the OnePlus launcher is the best OEM launcher, period. To add to that, I have 2 SIM cards and having the option to run 2x Whatsapp accounts on one phone thanks to the Parallel Apps feature is very handy.

Notifications are great though in my experience compared to you, simply because you can turn off individual notifications for every single app, so that you can customize which notifications you do and don't get. It's different to iOS, sure.

And then there's the little things, the vibrations motor, the 90Hz, the only Android phone with a hardware mute switch all add up for me to love this phone.

And yet... Then the most important question comes up. Would I buy OnePlus again? Well you might be confused by my answer because I own a OnePlus 9 Pro as well (like I said before). I received this OnePlus 9 Pro for free and who wouldn't say yes to a free phone, especially when you put a lot of time in for the other person... But the answer to my question, would I spend my own money and buy another OnePlus? I have both phones in  front of me currently...

Well yes and no. But mostly no.

I love the hardware and the features that OnePlus bring. It's just that Android 10's awful experience really didn't do them any favors and it took them a few months to make Android 11 'usable' as well... As well as that they are now integrating to Oppo, it's gonna take some time for them to impress me again.

Not to bash you or your review in any way or form, I agree with a lot of things that you said. I just wanted to add some things. 😊🙏🏼",16

I would also not recommend Oneplus the way they are now, i heard about the Oneplus update issue's but i never imagined being this bad, pushing an update that brick's user device is just plain stupidity.

They may look great on paper, but after some usage you will start noticing the shortcomings which are quite a few such as:

1. There's no proximity sensor, they just use the gyro to determine if you are talking over the phone and switch off the screen. Many times I have hanged or activated the airplane mode while in a conversation.
2. Auto-brightness works really bad and I find myself manually adjusting it all the time.
3. Updates are very very slow, and when they come they are bugged. I'm not your typical complainer after each update, but here I have to admit that OnePlus is very bad.
4. The camera is average at best. If I had to put it on words, I would say it is not trustworthy.

Regarding the camera, I definitely don't hate it. It has its shortcomings but I also don't expect DSLR quality photos from a smartphone camera so it definitely is adequate. My criticisms is more about the photo processing which OnePlus has indeed taken steps to improve, which is great.

Display/Media Consumption - I definitely agree here and actually touched on it in my review (last paragraph of the display section). Easy to miss since I pretty much wrote so much I almost hit Reddit's character limit. I also touched on the speed aspect, and pretty much agree. As a non-mobile gamer, it's pretty much as fast as I need it to be.

Regarding OxygenOS updates, I faintly remember my Android 9 experience and do recall that the battery life was better. It has been a few years so I might have forgotten. Battery life on Android 10 was still manageable, but I did find myself running out every so often. And my experience with Android 11 has not been anything close to good so I'll leave it at that.

Notifications seems to be a very divisive topic on both this thread and the one I cross posted on r/OnePlus. My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be hard to just add a toggle for how you want to sort your notifications. Android being so customizable, this makes the most sense to me.

Android,"Google offering ‘voluntary exit’ for employees working on Pixel, Android",https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/,"Worked at a place that wanted to try this.  Didn't go too well.   We'd get into the office the next day, look to see the code they'd submitted and... then spend the rest of the morning fixing it to actually do anything, if they'd not also broken stuff that was actually working.  
Soooo many meetings we'd get dragged into with management and the offshore team, that would all agree to do something, then the next day ""oh, you wanted us to do that?"" Another day lost.  
They then hired an offshore team to manage the coding team.  That didn't go too well either.  Same problems of ""what the heck is this they've done, this isn't even for us I don't think, this looks to be for some other client, but they've checked it in to our stuff.""   
Ended up hiring someone local to us, to fly out there, to sit in the room and explain to them how to code stuff that worked.    He said it was horrendous, people wandering in/out all day, someone would come in, do nearly an hour, leave, someone else would wander in, sit down, type a bit more...     He ended up picking out 2 or 3 who actually could code, getting them decent wages, comfy seat, pushing back when everyone else wandering in said THEY deserved the pay, it wasn't fair, they were going to get their uncle involved etc...  and for a couple of weeks, we actually got some decent stuff done.  And then the local guy came back, and the guys over there left to higher paying jobs, taking our code with them we think.  

Didn't take a year.  Think we figured it out the first look at the code the next day, but management pushed hard.  Think it was about 2 and a half months total that it was dumped.  The main coders just lost too much time to fix the junk coming at us, and the idea of just outsourcing even more to catch up was thankfully shot down when it was mentioned that the managers who wanted this so much should go over there to manage the project from that side.",96

Conversely a lot of business people tend to act like engineering is easy and trivial. It can all be done by simply plucking college kids on cheap right out of school, or hire people with sketchy credentials for pennies on the dollar in developing nations.

There is a valid complaint that universities have basically figured out MBA programs are a good money making scheme so they'll award them to almost anyone. So the quality of people with such degrees is massively diluted. So engineers not liking a lot of MBA types has substance.

Android,"Google offering ‘voluntary exit’ for employees working on Pixel, Android",https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/,"It's not so much about competence as it is about distance.

If you have an in-house developer, then you are on the same timezone, that developer knows the company and what it's doing. That developer has a relationship to the company and the people that work there, and is invested in the long-term success of the company.

If you outsource to the other side of the world, a lot of that goes out of the window. For starters, it's incredibly hard to foster good communication with a 12h timezone difference. With that alone you lost the ability to just have a call during normal business hours when things go bad.

But that outsourcer also has no personal investment in the project. If stuff is annoying they will just jump over to the next project. And they probably won't have a deep understanding of what the project is trying to accomplish, who the users are, what they need and so on.

In many cases the use case of the project might even culturally be different. Marketing, for example, works completely different even between Austria and Germany, and there's hardy a similarity between marketing in Europe and in China.

Developers on the other side of the world aren't worse. But running a project under these conditions is incredibly hard and it fails almost every time.

It would be similarly difficult for a company from e.g. Vietnam to successfully outsource to Europe or America.

Android,"Google offering ‘voluntary exit’ for employees working on Pixel, Android",https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/,"Again, someone who hasn't understood what the whole thing is about but who thinks they know it all.

Are you a manager by chance? It would fit.

The issue is not the quality or skill of the workers but the distance.

Running a project across the whole world is much more difficult, communication is slower, there's a much higher turnover with outsourcers and less of a relationship between the workers and the company/product.

Say you want to develop something with an in-house team. The product manager/project owner writes a specification for a feature. Since they are not a developer and don't know the code inside out, there is a small but vital mistake in the specification (happens very frequently). The developer takes the ticket, starts working on it and finds the problem. So they quickly have a short chat with the project manager (or hop on a short call when they are in home office), sort out the problem in 10 minutes and the dev continues to work. No problem here.

Now do the same thing with an external dev with 12h timezone difference. The dev runs across the problem and now there are three options: Schedule an expensive out-of-work-hours call with the project manager for the next day, send an email and risk ping-ponging back and forth for a few days or implement it based on the dev's flawed understanding of what business wants, risking an entirely wrong implementation. All this is not only losing time, but it's losing money too and you risk angering your customers, which is much, much more expensive than an inhouse dev.

Add to that that outsources generally have a much higher turn-over rate and thus much less knowledge about the business domain. And did I talk about language and culture barriers?

So of course, great software can be developed in China, by Chinese companies working with Chinese inhouse workers in the same timezone speaking the same language.

But if a Chinese company would outsource to Europe or America, they'd be in for a lot of trouble too.

All of which you would know if you ever had anything to do with outsourced work from far away.

And again, if outsourcing to India or Asia came with no downsides, why are there still developer jobs in Europe and America?",2

Solely relying on one skillset is rarely going to work save for cases where the individuals with that sole focus have good communication with one another and trust one another's expertise - just having an MBA and no background on the creation of the product a company makes can open you up to losing focus on the product for the business.

Yes, you lose some efficiency if you have to hop on a call vs just talking in person. But with a 12h timezone difference every little question takes a day. You can't have any back-and-forth at all unless someone goes on a call far outside of business hours.

I've worked in fully-remote jobs where everyone's in Europe and I worked in a job where part of the team was in Vietnam. It's a massive difference.

> In our company, it's no less different if the Dev is a FTE because of how often devs are being shuffled between projects.

Well, of course you can pull the same kind of crap that outsourcing forces on you with insourcers as well. Had that e.g. when I worked at Broadcom. My team worked on 4 different huge legacy projects within a single year. We collectively did basically nothing because we spent all our time getting to know the new project before being shuffled to the next one. And yes, this style of ""work"" is ridiculously inefficient, and you can artificially force it onto insourced people, but you can hardly do anything against this when working with outsourced people.

You are comparing the worst possible kind of management for insource with the average case for outsource.

> Honestly, this sounds a bit like corporate talk. If you paid your employees good and did not work them to exhaustion, I think they would want to see your company, if not their career, flourish - hence they will become more invested in the job. I'm saying this as an FTE from an outsourced branch of a US-based company.

It does sound a little like corporate talk, but it's actually true. It's a huge difference if I think ""I'm gonna be gone from that project in 2 months anyway"" or if I think ""I'm going to spend the next 7 years on this project"".

It's also a huge difference in the way you can reason about work. If I spent 3 years already on this project and I really care about it, and business comes with a crap requirement that will mess up part of the project, then I will have the knowledge, the motivation and the interpersonal security to argue against the requirement and to come up with something better.

If I'm on the project for a month and I'm expecting to work for an entirely different product from a different company in half a year's time because I'm an outsourcer and will get rotated away anyway, then I'll lack anything that would make me able to oppose the bad requirement.

And of course, you can foster the same crappy work environment with insourced people, but again, that's crappy management (with insouced people) vs just the nature of the setup (with outsourced people)",1

Why is there a shortage?  Various reasons, but not enough STEM students and simply not enough talented & motivated folks is part of it...  You can teach basic programming to most folks, many can learn to be a decent programmer, but excellence also requires luck (ie. talent, mindset, and not just hard work, likely starting at an early age as well), and there's simply too few of those in the US (330 mil population vs 8 billion worldwide: there will always be more excellent folks outside).

Same with management.

That does some very nice effects, so e.g. if a customer wants to know something or wants a new feature, usually the project manager will already know enough about the project so that they can say whether its feasible and if not, then the team will know everything needed.

Compared to a team that gets reassigned a lot, where the product manager knows nothing, has to ask the team and the team also knows nothing and first has to reverse-engineer to code to figure out what the customer even wants.",1

Eventually I moved to Android, and it's so frustrating that most of the apps I use on Android have such a half-baked UI.

I'm in the free trial right now and I love their music selection, and the fact that you can get HiFi audio would easily give them my business over all competitors.

But both their Android app and their desktop app are buggy like you wouldn't believe. I want to switch to them so badly for the HiFi but I just don't know if I can justify it when it's so frustrating to use.

* For starters, every once in a while, the next/previous song buttons stop working, along with the queue. Yep, you literally need to force close the app and make a new queue to get the ability to change songs working again.

* The ""create a radio station based on this track/artist"" button does nothing. You can click the button, but nothing happens.

* The app is always running in the background - every time I close the app, I need to hit the ""x"" in the notification to make it go away. Closing the app doesn't work. Swiping the notification away doesn't even work because it comes back in 5 minutes.

* Occasionally it forgets it's Chromecasting and I need to disconnect and reconnect

* You can't sort playlists in a custom order. Only by alphabetical or by date added. I have approx 45 large playlists so this is inexcusable

...I wish Spotify would just get HiFi already",10

* zooming is finicky and having to reset the zoom distance before you can swipe makes navigating a bit annoying.

*  It's good for photos taken with the camera, but as an overall photo/media library, it's pretty bare. I loved QuickPic but avoided it after they were bought out. 

And as for Google apps, they're so minimal it makes it difficult for people who like the customization of Android. Barely any theme customization is one of my bigger gripes.

The worst is you get an article about someone or something you have zero interest in and tell the app you don't want stories about X anymore.  Then a little while later you get the same exact story but under some other ""trending"" topic.  So you tell it you are not interested in that topic either.  THEN, it shows you it again but this time under the name of the site it was posted on.  Your only option then is to block that site, which sucks if you like articles from that site other times.  You are basically forced to bend-over and take their trending story.

It is madness.  It just shows you articles/trending topics from sources I am sure are being paid for (which explains taking away the ability to swipe cards away), rather than anything you have an interest in.  Even when it does show you something you are interested in, it does so from the most clickbaity source it can find and then shows you 50 versions of the same story from different sites rehosting the article for day and days.  

If I could find a better app for bathroom reading, I would delete the google app so fast... Oh, wait, you can't delete it anymore.  You can disable it, but then half your shit stops working.  Ugh.

Most of my friends don't have this stuff and they can't tell the difference unless they listen on my gear. I had a friend recently who didn't believe me at all, but then he sat down and listened with me and was super surprised. Almost immediately took back all of the hate he was giving me lol.

With a good enough system, you can usually tell pretty quickly if a song is lossless or not. It does depend on the mastering though.

Some of the more obvious differences are in clarity of the high pitched sounds - when a singer has a hard ""s"" or ""t"", it has more bite to it. It sounds more like real speech. Or you can hear the instruments' harmonics more clearly if you're consciously listening for it. Another big difference is in channel separation. For example, a song with 4 or 5 people singing at once (The Eagles for example), you can much more clearly tell the voices apart.

Now, I say this as someone who's crazy passionate about music. I'd say it compares to the kind of person who loves movies, so they buy a super high-end 4k HDR TV. For most people, it's overkill. A normal TV is fine. But for someone who loves movies, they'll go off about how much darker the blacks are, how the colors are so much better. They need to get special movies that support all of those features if they really want to make use of them.

If you've ever seen really nice new HDR TV, they're pretty great, but it doesn't really matter *that much* to most people. Same with music and a good HiFi system. It does make a pretty significant difference, but unless you really care about audio, it won't matter that much to you.

320kbps on Spotify is pretty good, but it's a definite step down compared to lossless.",9
