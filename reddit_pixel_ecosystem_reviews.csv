"The Verge Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review: big upgrade, much smaller earbuds+"
"Earbuds issue when Pixel8 pro is connected to pixel watch 1+Hi, so I've been having this problem for a long time and across 2 phones (pixel 6 & 8 pro) hopefully someone can help! I've done a lot of Googling and messing with settings and am still having the problem. It goes like this... 

Pixel phone connected to earbuds - no problem

Pixel phone connected to watch - no problem 

Pixel phone connected to watch and any other audio device (car, speaker etc.) - no problem

Pixel phone connected to watch and earbuds  - disconnecting and cutting out all the time. 

I've tried with multiple pairs of earbuds and have had the same problem, I think it's something to do with the phone treating each ear bus as separate connections possibly?

Anyone have any ideas on a fix?

Thanks so much in advanced!

Stolen Google pixel buds pro 2 earbuds. Can I tack it?+So my mom ordered the Pixel buds pro 2 and the box was stolen off our porch before we made it home. Is there away for me to track them?
"Is there a Google Pixel devices support charging stations ?+Does anyone know any information about charging pads or stations that support all Google Pixel Phones, Earbuds, Watch together like the ones Anker has for Apple products?"
Lost pixel earbuds+I found a pair of Google pixel earbuds without knowing what they were… then I looked them up and saw the price tag. Can I locate the owner? Can I send them a notification?
"Google Pixel Buds A-Series in the washing machine. +Hey everyone, coming with a question here. 

Yesterday, I had my Pixel Buds in the Washing Machine, I don't know for how long they've been there (it wasn't a full cycle, as I removed them as soon as I realized, maybe 20 minutes?) and don't know what to do. I've left them to dry, first on the heater, but not for long, then on my desk just enough for them to dry. 

The right ear bud shows up on my Pixel, it's slowly losing battery. 

I probably fucked the left ear bud, because I pressed on the ""Ring my device"" button to see if they are gone. But I'm not sure as I can't charge them. It did have a sound though when I did that. 

The case... It's weird. I have a yellow-Orange flashing light appearing and disappearing. 

I don't know if I should even bother anymore or just replace them at Google (is it even worth it to repair? If the cost is the same as the main earbuds, 80€, I'd rather wait and get the Pro on my Birthday). 

What are everyone's thoughts?

"Lost google pixel earbuds+Hey all,

I lost my google pixel buds and can't find them by looking for them. The problem I'm having is that i don't have a google phone (I have iPhone), so I'm not able to use the find my iPhone app. I am very worried as this is the second time I've lost them. If there is anything i can do, I'm open to suggestions."
"Another victim of phones being stolen in transit+**11-27-24 Update** \- Google has finally come to their senses and issued me a refund.  I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  

**Original post** \- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8/28.  On 8/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9/16 I received the following response:

""After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.""

Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a ""product specialist"".  The ""product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.

I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google’s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google’s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.

FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.  At this point I'm posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven't thought of or tried to this point."
