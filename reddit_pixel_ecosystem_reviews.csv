GooglePixel,Pixel Buds Pro from Airpods Pro user,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/w9jnk5/pixel_buds_pro_from_airpods_pro_user/,"Thanks for posting this. As the owner of a pair of AirPod Pros, Pixel Buds A Series, and soon to be Pixel Buds Pros, this was very relevant to me. 

Outside of my APP's having ANC, Transparency, and wireless charging, I actually prefer the comfort and sound quality of the A Series, plus they work much more reliably on my Pixel than my AirPods do, which often need to be put back in the case once or twice to get both AirPods to connect to my Pixel. I could never quite get the fit perfect either, despite trying all ear tips. They have fallen out multiple times while walking or eating, but that hasn't really happened to me with the A Series.

As such, I'm very excited to have comparable features and better battery life in the Pixel Buds Pros! Hopefully they can improve the transparency a bit, but I'm not too surprised to hear that they aren't as good as the APP's, just because it's crazy good on those. I care more about the ANC anyways, so it is very promising to hear that the Buds Pros have the edge there over the APP.

I will still use my AirPods with my iPad and work iPhone, so now I will have a nice set of ANC earbuds dedicated to both platforms that I use. That should be pretty nice.",8

If they're anything like the other Pixel Buds you can adjust the EQ to increase the bass. It's not perfect but it helps. On my Pixel 6 Pro it's under Settings > Connected Devices > gear icon next to Pixel Buds > Sound

I personally also use a third party EQ app made for Bluetooth to really dial in a better EQ with my Pixel Buds A-Series:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.audiosmaxs.bassboostermusic

It sucks that you have to do any of this, especially with more expensive earbuds, they should come with a good dialed in EQ setting, but there are some things you can do to make the audio quality better.",1

In regards to connectivity, I had the exact same issues that you are, in fact, sometimes I had to unpair and repair my AirPods. Sometimes one side would connect and the other wouldn't, sometimes they would just automatically disconnect and reconnect. Just constant issues, but as you know, they were worth overlooking given the amazing features that the AirPods pros were offering.

For me, when I tried the A series last year, they wouldn't stay in my ears for longer than 3 seconds, and they constantly popped out. So I had the opposite experience in regards to fit. In regards to the AirPods, if I was on a jog, they would definitely be falling out. However, I did buy comply foam ear tips, and I would strongly recommend you do the same, because they make the fit 100% secure. I will be doing the same for the pixel Bud pros as well.

Yes absolutely, if ANC is a priority for you, the buds will blow you away in comparison to the AirPod pros. Very noticeable positive difference. And lucky you, you get to enjoy the best of both worlds!",8

Now turn on AutoEq and it will bring up a search menu. 

-Type in Pixel and you'll see a bunch of options like pixel buds (2017), pixel buds 2020, series-A, etc but nothing for the Pro's. 

-I'm sure it will have them added in a few days. 



If you want to use a present Graphic Equalizer in the meantime, you may need to pay for the app. (I bought it in 2020 so I can't remember). 

-To turn on the graphic equalizer, look under AutoEq and click on the name graphic equalizer.

I think you are wearing the AirPods wrong. They specifically are designed not to go into your ear canal, and just rest in your outer ear. They aren’t supposed to create a seal. 

When I first used Apple’s EarPods, I had the same problem of becoming uncomfortable after 15-30 minutes of use, because I was pressing them deeper into my ear to try and maintain a seal. 

Now, I can wear the AirPods for hours and sometimes forget they are in my ears, just like you do with the Pixel Buds. ",3

I've tried a bunch and they all have fatal flaws. Samsung's having terrible battery life, others that fit so poorly and are uncomfortable, etc.

I've tried many of the cheap ones and they are garbage too.

The airpods just pop in, they work perfectly each time, and sound fine. Plus they don't block sound so I can actually walk around with them outside and not worry about getting hit by a car.

Curious how you know the driver is the same as on the earpod. Apple doesn't release that info.",4

Also the case likely has a circuit that is turning them off until the case is opened. Both factors limiting charge cycles and extending their battery life. ,7

Obviously, they aren't going to sound identical, as Apple probably tuned the Airpods a little different, but that really doesn't change the fact that the audio components are the same quality as the ones you get for free with your smartphone. So it's going to be average sound quality, which is disappointing at that price point. ",0

I disagree. It seems that Apple has released that info, as seen in the Verge's review, where they say the following:
""Apple claims the audio components are virtually the same between the two products (...)""
So there you go, you're paying premium money for features you don't have access to, as the audio components clearly aren't high-grade.

It would be easier for you to just google stuff like ""Best wireless earphones"" and such, but i can name a few which i would personally much rather get.


-  Samsung Gear IconX 2nd gen. 

The 2nd gen has a MUCH improved battery life, and ontop of that these headphones are incredibly feature-packed and water resistant, and you can also use those features with your android smartphone. 
Here is a quote from Tom's guide's review regarding battery life.
> The biggest problem we had with the original Gear IconX was its battery life, which clocked in at a paltry 90 minutes;. (...) Samsung sacrificed the heart rate sensor to extend the battery to 5 hours of Bluetooth streaming and 7 hours of local music playback.

- jaybird X3

These are just a classic recommendation, as they're a good bang for your buck.

- Beoplay E8 

These are exciting new earphones, which are created by the renowned Bang & Olufsen, so sound quality should be great. Furthermore, they're pretty featured packed. I have auditioned these myself, but for a brief moment, so not long enough to make a judgement, but they definitely did not sound bad

- Bose SoundSport free wireless earbuds

I would like to note that i heavily dislike the Airpods, as they are ""earbuds"" and by that i mean earphones that literally just hang in your ear. They don't offer any isolation at all, which i heavily dislike, as it means that every single noise will disrupt my music. This could lead to me turning up the volume, in order to actually hear my music properly over the outside noise, which could damage my hearing with time. Additionally, earbuds don't isolate the other way either, meaning other people will easily be able to hear your music, if you turn it a little bit up. Therefore earphones that actually have silicone/foam tips that go into your ear and isolate is much better, imo. If you want to hear the outside tho, then i think that both the Gear IconX and the Beoplay E8 has a feature that allows the outside noise to come through the earphones.

Edit: Apparently I'm downvoted for going above and beyond, when it comes to recommending alternatives. I suppose opinions that aren't pro-airpods really are damaging for people here. ",-2

Android,Google Pixel Buds - My Thoughts After a Day's Use (x-post from /r/GooglePixel),https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7c8sia/google_pixel_buds_my_thoughts_after_a_days_use/,"Yeah. I love using wired headphones as the connection is flawless and power is no issue on that end. I have found what seem like good wireless headphones and will test out the purported battery life to see if it matches my use case. I generally won't mind too much if something will last at least a day because I aim to charge things every night.

If my 6P gives up and I have to go with a phone missing a jack for a stupid arbitrary reason then I should test out my options while I still have the option of both. I know about using a dongle but we really should be beyond that by now.

Wireless headphones do have some advantages but having another device reliant on a battery isn't ideal. What I really don't like is not having an easy choice between them. Google has been tending to remove more options recently for the sake of simplicity. Hangouts losing SMS integration, removing the headphone jack, that kind of thing.",1

The X3 and Beoplay E8 isn't wired. The Jaybird X3 earphones are connected to each other with a wire tho, but not a wire to the source. The Beoplay E8 is not wired at all tho, not even between the earphones, they're completely wireless.

You also said you had the Beoplay. Do you mean have alrdy owned the Beoplay E8? I would be pretty shocked if that's what you mean, as they were released very recently.

If you only accept earbuds tho, then Airpods is essentially the only option, as no other company is crazy enough to make expensive earbuds. ",0
