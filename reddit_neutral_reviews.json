The pros are obvious and stated by other users here as well as on CNET, Wired, CNET, etc.\u00a0On the flip side, the phone has fallen victim to the same fallacy affecting other first-generation novelties - focusing on the breakthrough feature but sacrificing both basic features associated with a smartphone. Moreover, the Fold (even when compared to the Galaxy) is quite rudimentary and lfalls short with heuristics that define the user experience interacting with a table-type phone.* Battery - Terrible as always. I\u2019ve never had a Pixel phone where I didn\u2019t have the battery saver on by defaults nd it still dies within 3\/4 of my day without charge* No good case - Even , the front portion of the case easily loses its adhesiveness around the 2-3 mm border. This is more of an issue with the case, but the design of the phone itself does not allow for an appropriate case for the front panel* Front panel - Very difficult to backwards swipe to go to a previous web page when viewing in a broswer- will usually just translate to the next Home Screen panel * Fold display - this clearly a first draft and I wish I had waited for the third. So many issues:   * Screen takes 2-3 seconds to \u201cturn on\u201d when unfolding the phone   * Google tries very hard to describe the two panel feature, but it is FAR from self-explanatory. Moreover, even basic apps from Google do not function properly, with many text-entry app functions missing the keyboard for swipe or text (forcing me to fold the phone to the single display to have the keyboard pop up)   * Several apps will take up 1.t5 screens   * They keyboard, when it appears, has a humungous gap in the keyboard between the panels, making swype inefficient and unusable* Incompatibility between Gmail and Dropbox - this apparently is an issue for all Google \/ Android phones* Ongoing Android\/iPhone MMS disconnect - leading to granular video appearing when Apple and Android users are together on MMS* Unlocked phones have data reconnecrtivity issues after switching to Wi-Fi for calling (no signal) but then having an issue with the Wi-Fi at the location itself. After a couple hours, once you leave the dead zone area and return to 5G\/LTE areas, the phone can take hours to reconnect to Verizon. Even with toggling Airplane mode, SIM card, and multiple restarts* Awkward tapping of the rear horizontal camera panel to take a screenshot - absolutely inconsistent and clumsy * Significant lag in accessing text messages especially when you have multiple years of conversations stored)* Camera quality IMHO took a hit compared to Pixel 6 and predecessors* Verizon general signal issues.","28":"Android 15 vs iOS 18 +","29":"Wtf?
