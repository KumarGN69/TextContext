In other words, the charging status is not displayed on the lock screen from 80% to 100%.This issue does not occur when using Adaptive Charging.Update: After I charged my Pixel 8 to 100% again and let it trickle charge for a while until the shield icon appeared next to the battery icon, the 80% charging limit started working again. I guess it\u2019s not a bug but rather a battery percentage calibration after a system update. My apologies\u2014I wrongly blamed Google.Note: Anyone experiencing this issue must charge the battery to 100% and then make sure to continue charging until the shield icon appears on the battery icon and the \"Charging Complete\" message reappears at the bottom of the lock screen before unplugging the charger.
