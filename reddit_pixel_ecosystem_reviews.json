paired with the pixel phone, which would you prefer?","1":"Do you think you could wear these on a run or jog \/ at the gym without them falling out? That's been my main concern when I see their size.","2":"Is your scale relative to APP or absolute?","3":"Great writeup! \n\nThis is the kind of user feedback I look for when considering a purchase, and your comments both give me hope for the future of the line, and pause considering the high treble in videos (the bulk of my content consumption over my earbuds).\n\nThanks and keep up the great work!","4":"How are they with phone calls, can ppl hear you clearly, can you hear ppl clearly?\n\nWith background noise how is it talking and hearing someone","5":"Can you compare ANC between WF XM4?","6":"Thanks for posting this. As the owner of a pair of AirPod Pros, Pixel Buds A Series, and soon to be Pixel Buds Pros, this was very relevant to me. \n\nOutside of my APP's having ANC, Transparency, and wireless charging, I actually prefer the comfort and sound quality of the A Series, plus they work much more reliably on my Pixel than my AirPods do, which often need to be put back in the case once or twice to get both AirPods to connect to my Pixel. I could never quite get the fit perfect either, despite trying all ear tips. They have fallen out multiple times while walking or eating, but that hasn't really happened to me with the A Series.\n\nAs such, I'm very excited to have comparable features and better battery life in the Pixel Buds Pros! Hopefully they can improve the transparency a bit, but I'm not too surprised to hear that they aren't as good as the APP's, just because it's crazy good on those. I care more about the ANC anyways, so it is very promising to hear that the Buds Pros have the edge there over the APP.\n\nI will still use my AirPods with my iPad and work iPhone, so now I will have a nice set of ANC earbuds dedicated to both platforms that I use. That should be pretty nice.","7":"I'm jealous. Mines are at a UPS facility 30 minutes away from me, but I have to wait until Monday...\n\nEdit: typos","8":"What about that adjusting pressure feature (sensors that are capable of adjusting the pressure in the ear canal). Does it feel the same as the airpods pro?","9":"Can I see cat photos?","10":"How are the magnets that hold the buds in the case?\n\nOn my Pixel Buds 2 the magnets are super strong and if you get the buds near it they fall into place no matter their orientation \n\nOn the gf's A Series, the magnets are much weaker and I've noticed you have to line it up pretty well when putting the buds in the case","11":"How are they for audio sync when watching a video, on a phone and on a PC?\n\nDo you think you could sleep with them in your ears and your head on a pillow (on an airplane)?    \n\nMy main issues with APPs are connecting to a Pixel and volume controls.  Also battery life could be better.  I could live with somewhat worse audio quality if comfort and ANC were no worse and the other issues were better (although comfort can be a very individual thing).  Would you recommend the PBP?","12":"Appreciate this Review 100%\n\nHave used the Pixel Buds Gen 1, Pixel Buds Gen 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2, and have been eyeing the Pixel Buds Pro since the announcement. \n\nExcited to snag some now!","13":"Can anyone hear you when you're wearing them? Cause the a series everyone hears what I'm hearing and so annoying... Especially, I'm blasting The Wicked End by Avenged Sevenfold. Thanks","14":"Do they stick out further than the regular Pixel Buds 2 \/ A-series? One of my favorite features of the buds is how they fit kind of flush, so you can wear them under a helmet.","15":"Do you have Chromecast with Google TV? If yes, could you please test sync issues on YouTube? Please try multiple videos because for some it may work fine (as did Buds 2) but not for others (as Buds 2 didn't) depending on the encoding.","16":"The magnetic lock looks legit, and loving the small pod size.","17":"How's the battery life?","18":"Perhaps I missed this somewhere or I\u2019m ignorant of the specs that would allow it, but do you know if these would allow the Dolby atmos feature on Apple Music?","19":"hows the connectivity?  I know some folks have reported prior edition buds having extremely spotty connectivity.","20":"Nice LTT deskpad \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","21":"Solid review","22":"Do they charge wirelessly? I wish the buds series A did.","23":"Stems. The most overlooked aspect of wireless earbuds. They should all have stems lol Going from AAP to Galaxy buds 2 has been hard. I can't even touch my earbuds without pausing or skipping a song. And I don't want to turn those gestures\/touches off because they are useful when you need them. But so annoying when you just want to adjust your earbud. Eager to test out the PBPs tonight","24":"[deleted]","25":"So ANC isn't significantly better and transparency mode doesn't compare to a nearly 3 year old Airpods Pro? That's unfortunate.","26":"I give them 3 months at best. That's twice as long as mine worked. Google will screw you out of any replacement or repairs too. Sad how much they've changed in recent years","27":"Is the case waterproof\/resistant?","28":"Re: audio quality\n\nIf they're anything like the other Pixel Buds you can adjust the EQ to increase the bass. It's not perfect but it helps. On my Pixel 6 Pro it's under Settings > Connected Devices > gear icon next to Pixel Buds > Sound\n\nI personally also use a third party EQ app made for Bluetooth to really dial in a better EQ with my Pixel Buds A-Series:\n\nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=io.audiosmaxs.bassboostermusic\n\nIt sucks that you have to do any of this, especially with more expensive earbuds, they should come with a good dialed in EQ setting, but there are some things you can do to make the audio quality better.","29":"Great review! Thanks for posting.","30":"How about audio sync with netflix? Prime video?","31":"I don\u2019t get what you mean by AirPods Pro don\u2019t play nice. They work perfectly fine for me with my Samsungs and iPads. AirPods Pro are the best","32":"\n>But still nowhere near the APP's\n\nyou mentioned the transparency mode wasn't as good, which was one of the main features I was excited for. I've never experienced transparency mode, would you say the pixel's is good enough for using in school or in a conversation?","33":"[deleted]","34":"Are you saying you got ANC and Transparency from the APP to work with a Pixel Phone? How? I thought those didn't work","35":"Man I wish there was a collection of cute cases for the pixel buds like there are for APP","36":"Do you know if the case dimensions are the same as the A series? I have a custom case I'm hoping will fit the new pros.","37":"How good are the microphones? Especially in wind.","38":"Is one of your pixel buds shinier than the other one? I got mine today and one of them is Mate and the other one is shinny \ud83d\ude16","39":"I'm curious how the case will hold. I was one of the many that got a little hairline crack in the OG buds case after a few months. It's not like I was slamming the case shut either","40":"Nice LTT desk pad my guy","41":"How is the multipoint connectivity between Android and windows laptop? I want to use these at work so that I can listen to music on my phone, take a teams meeting on my laptop etc without having to disconnect","42":"Can other people hear what you're listening to? That's why I returned my original Pixel Buds. The transparency vent allows too much noise to bleed out, especially as compared to the original and second gen Airpods. A major use case for me is on the airplane and subway, so this is crucial. To being a good neighbor.","43":"If it wasn't for the high frequencies piercing my ears, I would say the Pixel Buds for sure. If I'm able to find a custom EQ software to turn the treble down and turn the mids up, then no probs. Otherwise, if this is a long term thing and isn't fixed through a software update or third party app, it would be a deal breaker. I care about my ear health more.","44":"AirPods Pro are awesome with android . Best thing on the market","45":"I probably wouldn't be comfortable with that, but I intend on getting comply foam tips anyway, which would essentially rid that concern for me. Hopefully that helps!","46":"This is also my biggest concern. I bike a lot and have had issues with one ear bud falling out and losing it forever. I just got my Bud Pros in the mail today, first thing I did was jump around, shake my head as hard as I could, and try to get them to fall out. They didn't budge at all. These are probably the best comfort pair of buds I've ever owned.","47":"Great question, I had not thought of that while making them . Thinking back to when I rated each, I would say relative, as I am coming from 2 years experience of the APP's and am spoiled by it's existing feature set.","48":"Glad I could help!","49":"This is my biggest concern. I have the A series and people literally here everything other than my voice. If the Buds Pro fix this, I'll probably get them.","50":"Not OP, but so far it's been great for me. I came from the 2020 Pixel Buds, which frequently got comments about how clear I sounded on video calls even with one bud in. Haven't had has much to sample with yet, but so far the experience has been good on video calls.","51":"I haven't answered this just yet as I haven't put myself in a noisy enough situation to give you the answer you're looking for. But I will definitely give you one by end of day today, and plan on driving with the windows rolled down on the highway and with them up.","52":"Here's my update:\n\nSo far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they haven't commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","53":"Just a heads up, I have updated the post to include call quality. Hope it helps!","54":"ANC Is better on the WF, but not by much. You'd have to really be paying attention to notice the difference, otherwise Google did an excellent job.","55":"I'm glad this is relevant to you! That's exactly why I made this, as I was looking for something like this but couldn't find any myself.\n\nIn regards to connectivity, I had the exact same issues that you are, in fact, sometimes I had to unpair and repair my AirPods. Sometimes one side would connect and the other wouldn't, sometimes they would just automatically disconnect and reconnect. Just constant issues, but as you know, they were worth overlooking given the amazing features that the AirPods pros were offering.\n\nFor me, when I tried the A series last year, they wouldn't stay in my ears for longer than 3 seconds, and they constantly popped out. So I had the opposite experience in regards to fit. In regards to the AirPods, if I was on a jog, they would definitely be falling out. However, I did buy comply foam ear tips, and I would strongly recommend you do the same, because they make the fit 100% secure. I will be doing the same for the pixel Bud pros as well.\n\nYes absolutely, if ANC is a priority for you, the buds will blow you away in comparison to the AirPod pros. Very noticeable positive difference. And lucky you, you get to enjoy the best of both worlds!","56":"What is APP","57":"I feel your pain man!","58":"Yup! I don't have that blocked feeling! However, Transparency mode has been mastered on the APP's, so there does feel like a bit of noise blockage, but not plugged at all like I've experienced others. I hope that makes sense!","59":"[My cat sleeping!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LYmMsvO.jpg)","60":"Created a video just for you\n\nhttps:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/bM9R34wfPSmYMHcN8","61":"So far just tested on my phone and YouTube, YT Music audio sync looks to be on point. Are there any apps you'd like me to specifically test?\n\nYes you can definitely sleep with them against a pillow. Significantly better than APP's. \n\nI too have had constant issues with connecting the APP's to my Pixel. So far in my few hours of use, not one connection\/disconnection issue at all. Also according to other reviews, battery life is excellent and surpasses what is marketed even with ANC on. \n\nYou'll be happy to know that ANC is very noticeably superior on the PBP's in comparison to the APP's.\n\nStill  testing, but at preliminary recommendation, if I can find an EQ software to turn the high frequencies down, then yes I would recommend the Buds over the Airpods.","62":"Glad to hear it! I don't think you'll be disappointed.","63":"Nope! My wife can't hear it and I'm sitting right beside her while she's in bed, playing the same song you just mentioned.","64":"I'm sorry I don't have a pair of Pixel Buds 2 or A series to compare to, but I can tell you they are significantly more flush in comparison to the Airpods Pros if that helps!","65":"Mine feel about as flush as my 2020 pixelbuds. Taking off my shirt after a bike ride today they didn't come out, if that's any help :)","66":"I have both and they stick out a bit further than the A series but not by much. I tested them with my motorcycle helmet (Shoei RF-1200) and I can feel the helmet pushing against the buds a little bit. It feels more like they're being held in place vs being pushed into my ears though. I'd compare the sensation to if you had the buds in and you placed your hand in a cup over your ears until the tips of the buds just touched your hands. Hope that helps!","67":"I just tried with about five different videos on Chromecast with Google TV and everything seemed perfectly fine.","68":"Absolutely!","69":"Just had a conversation with a buddy for about an hour. In regards to battery life over that call, and some music and videos this morning, I'm at 95% on the left, and 89% on the right. I'd say that over about 2 hours of use with a mix of ANC and transparency.","70":"Also would like to know this once OP has had some time to get a feel for it","71":"It just dawned on me that I can test it with my wife's iPhone when she comes home. No Apple Music though still, but I think they implemented it with Disney+ if I'm not mistaken? Results to come shortly.","72":"Sorry, not sure! I'm not testing it with an iPhone, nor do I have Apple music.","73":"Connectivity is surprisingly phenomenal. They surpass the AirPod pros. In fact. Multipoint is phenomenal, works in between devices and automatically pauses the one that's not playing. Even if one is playing and I try to unpause the one that's not playing, it will automatically pause that one. Hard to explain but once you get them you'll understand what I mean!","74":"Thanks!","75":"Thanks! I'm glad it brought some value to you!","76":"Yes they do! Unfortunately not on my Gen 1 Pixel Charger, but it works apparently on the Gen 2.\n\n\\*\\*Edit they do charge upside down on the Gen 1! Woohoo!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt does work through Battery share on my Pixel 6 Pro.","77":"Wireless charging is mentioned on Google's product page, right near the top.","78":"I absolutely agree! It'll be a hard transition for me too, but so worth it now that I'm finally sticking with the Google ' ecosystem'!","79":"I'm sorry I'm not clear on your question, can you elaborate on what you're looking for?","80":"The sound is marginally superior, but the Air Pods Pro is a better overall product -- especially with how they don't actually go in your ears and the spatial audio. Mediocre execution from Google as usual and I'm a fanboy.\n\nRight now, I'm still waiting to hear something better than the Jabra 75t, though I haven't tried all those new Kickstarter earbuds with multiple drivers.","81":"Not sure how to respond to this... Do you have a question you'd like me to answer?","82":"According to Google, yes it is\n\nhttps:\/\/store.google.com\/product\/pixel\\_buds\\_pro\\_specs?hl=en-US#:\\~:text=Pixel%20Buds%20Pro%20are%20designed,repair%2C%20disassembly%2C%20or%20damage.","83":"Just checked, unfortunately nothing under the sound screen like you mentioned! Might just be a pixel buds Pro omission.https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vuz6h7h.png\n\nAlso, I'll check your app suggestion out. Thanks so much!","84":"Pleasure!","85":"So I don't have Netflix, but I did check with Prime Video and Disney plus and both have no noticeable latency at all. I hope that helps!","86":"That's great to hear that it's working for your Samsung well! I would hope that it worked well with your iPad as well.\n\nI had said that it doesn't play nice with my pixel. Also a lot of other people in this community feel the same way in regards to pixel and AirPod connection issues. Hopefully that clears that up.","87":"Easy answer: absolutely. Especially if you haven't experienced the AirPods at all. The transparency mode on the pixel buds Pro is very functional.","88":"So far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they have in commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","89":"It just works when you connect them, hold on the button to toggle between the two","90":"I'm not a case person, but I can completely understand that! I'm sure they'll come out soon.\n\nI'm Looking forward to dbrand skins!","91":"Hope this helps!\n\n[Pixel buds Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/m2LZalj.png)\n\n[Pixel buds A series](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZsIRlvn.png)","92":"Just had a conversation with a buddy while walking in some light wind, for about an hour. No issues at all, I could hear him and he could hear me clearly. Also, in regards to battery life over that call, and some music and videos this morning, I'm at 95% on the left, and 89% on the right. I'd say that over about 2 hours of use with a mix of ANC and transparency. I know you didn't ask, but in case you were wondering!","93":"Just checked, and confirmed that is not the case for me!","94":"I'm sorry to hear that! I'm not sure about that, I plan on getting a dbrand skin the moment they release it, hopefully that will mitigate any possibility of that happening!","95":"Thanks!","96":"Just tried it, seamless as fcuk. I pause music on the phone and play it on the computer, and it automatically plays. Vice versa pausing music on the computer, and playing on the phone, it's like instant. Zero lag. This is better than the AirPods multipoint variant IMO","97":"The product page says there will be an in app EQ customizer in the fall, so hopefully sooner than later.","98":"Look into the app Wavelet for an easy to use equalizer for Android and customized Eq for most headphones out there.","99":"Wavelet is a godsend. Best EQ I've ever used","100":"What videos or songs are giving you this issue?\n\nJust curious because I have the series A and never had issues with high frequency. I wanna test it out for myself.","101":"A few reviews have suggested using some bass boost something or another with them.  Have you tried that?","102":"You didn't give a direct comparison on sound to the APPs. I know APPs use a different inferior codec when paired to an Android phone so curious what the APPs on your Android would get out of 10 if the pixel bud pros are 7\/10","103":"Pixel buds software allows you to adjust bass and treble. Open the Pixel buds app. Settings; scroll down to \"Sound\"; slide the base from \"Less\" to \"More\" and turn on Volume EQ.  This makes my Pixel Buds A series sound incredible.","104":"Can you share the link please?","105":"Thank you for the review.","106":"I can confirm people can hear me clearly in the few different environments that I've tested, so if that's what you've been experiencing on the A series, I think your woes will be forgotten When switching over to these.","107":"People I call on the buds 2 say that same thing, really hominy this is addressed with the pros. I guess I'll find out tomorrow.","108":"So far I would concur with your experience. Indoor call quality is excellent, and people have said they can hear me just fine.","109":"Update on this: \n\nSo far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they haven't commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","110":"Glad to hear .. being able to make and receive phone calls is a big selling point for me as well as the clarity of the calls ..\n\nThanks for your real world testing","111":"Great thanks!","112":"Air pods pro","113":"Thanks! Hopefully Google will improve the transparency mode over time. I tried a lot of earphones overtime and no one beats the APP's yet.","114":"Thanks for paying the cat tax","115":"Awwww how awesome! Little tiger there","116":"You're a legend! \n\nNot terrible, but looks to be worse than the Pixel Buds 2 \ud83d\ude22","117":"Is that LTT pad ?","118":"My main video apps are YT and VLC on both Pixel and PC.  You can adjust audio delay on VLC, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSounds like a worthwhile upgrade, subject to the EQ issue.\n\nThanks!","119":"sorry been busy... dude you know that song??? That song is so underrated man... I mean the opera and everything gave me goosebumps the first I heard it","120":"Thanks for testing.","121":"Nice! I have an older pair of regular airpods and the battery life has been incredible so was hoping these would be at least comparable","122":"Hope you saw my reply up top!","123":"Hell yes - thank you for checking!","124":"Definitely, thank you. It's hard to find actual reviews","125":"Do they charge on the gen 1 charger if you flip the case upside down?\n\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/madebygoogle\/status\/1255564182075797504","126":"That might be worth the upgrade alone. I got the Pixel Buds Series A last December after getting pixel 6 in November. \n\nThanks for the details!","127":">Unfortunately not on my Gen 1 Pixel Charger\n\nWell that's kind of a bummer. I'll probably end up charging them overnight using Battery Share most of the time, but it still would have been nice to have the option to charge them using the 1st gen Pixel Stand.","128":"Lol not going to lie I can't believe I've done it myself. This pixel has been pretty damn nice. Minus Android auto.","129":"Sorry about the confusion aha. I shouldn't have used the question mark.","130":"Apparently just IPX2, so probably won't survive an accidental run through the washer. Luckily I have never done that before with my As...","131":"Damn. The bass control was added as a firmware update to the Pixel Buds A-Series, so maybe they'll do the same for the Pros.","132":"Is the bass on these ok or underwhelming? I'm trying to decide between these and the Beats Fit Pro since I listen to a lot of EDM and those are supposed to have good bass","133":"Yes thanks!!","134":"How? I\u2019ve never had it disconnect . Used with my fold 3, note 10+, pixels, etc. zero issues. And that\u2019s with AirPods 1, 2, and the pros. They work perfectly Fine. I guess only annoying thing is I can\u2019t change their options and what they do when you tap so I have to use my iPad for that but other than that, they work great, they even auto connect to my phone if I\u2019m not near my iPad. They work great. Zero issue and best pods on the market. Air pod pros are best thing apple makes.","135":"Yep it does work. Just no customization, since Apple does not offer an app for Androids. Similar to pixel buds on iOS, no app for iOS.","136":"That's awesome! I remember V1 buds had some exceptional mic and wind cancelling tech. Hope they didn't make compromises there.","137":"Niiiice. I will be going to my BestBuy to get them today. Thanks","138":"Hey that's amazing! Might be worth finding a 3rd party solution then. Will test and get back to you.","139":"Thanks for the suggestion!\n\nAfter downloading, am not able to figure it out. Do you have a guide you recommend to set it up?","140":"He's probably more sensitive to treble, some people are some aren't.","141":"Pretty much on almost every video in Youtube. Music in YT music doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=26qUyrVKBNs&t=327s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=26qUyrVKBNs&t=327s)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AREK4H8k7Ng&t=1s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AREK4H8k7Ng&t=1s)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dTh-7JYsp5k&t=105s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dTh-7JYsp5k&t=105s)","142":"I haven't found any bass boost options, can you link me to those reviews that mention it?","143":"9\/10 for the APPs, but really the only app that seems to be causing issues is YouTube. YT Music after my few hours of testing now I would give the PBP's a 9\/10 as well. Base sounds more full on these than Apple.","144":"I wish it were there! But unfortunately not available on the pixel buds Pro software as of yet. If you look through these comments, you'll see a screenshot of it as somebody else suggested this as well. Thanks!","145":"Link for?","146":"Pleasure!","147":"Thanks! I went ahead and pulled the trigger on the Charcoal.","148":"I updated the post in regards to call quality, hope it helps!","149":"Pleasure!","150":"Thanks \ud83d\udc4d","151":"I concur !","152":"Lol seriously","153":"Not sure about that sorry, can only compare to the Airpods. I can confidently say they are on par in regards to magnet attraction, for lack of a better term.","154":"Yup! Lttstore.com ;)","155":"NP!","156":"Pleasure!","157":"I think you'll be impressed!","158":"Just confirmed, Spatial audio does not work. I double checked with my old AirPod pros to make sure I was in the right setting as well. Sorry!\n\nFor the record, I checked in Disney+","159":"Fuck Yeah! Well done, they do!","160":"Sounds good!","161":"They do charge on gen 1, but you need to flip the case upside down\n\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/madebygoogle\/status\/1255564182075797504","162":"I'm sorry to hear, Android auto hasn't gotten any better? I used to have a car that supported it, but just gave that lease back about a year ago and take transit now.","163":"Same as A Series\n\nFWIW my dad's A series went through the wash and survived. Had problems shortly after but a factory reset solved it","164":"EQ for the Buds Pro isn't coming until the fall.","165":"Google store says 5 babe eq sliders coming in the fall for the buds pro","166":"I think you'll love this. Bass is excellent. Very full. But then again that is my opinion, I'd suggest you get them and try them out, return period is 30 days if they're really that bad for you.","167":"Sounds good man! You're lucky!","168":"Wavelet works with anything.","169":"Try Poweramp. Good app.","170":"Wavelet's Pixel Buds preset took my Pixel Buds (2020) to an entirely different level. Can't listen to anything without it. It's a great little app. Maybe start there and see if the EQ is to your liking. [**Here's the EQ with the preset**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/V7tE4W3.png). Just search \"Pixel Buds\" and you should see it. Select it, and whenever you use the buds, it'll automatically select that preset and you're good to go.","171":"Open the app and click the \"power button\" on and it will turn blue. \n\n-Then you will want to click the gear on the bottom right side and turn on legacy mode to see all the settings. \n\n-If you turn off legacy mode, those settings will only show up if you have audio playing in the background. \n\n\n\nNow turn on AutoEq and it will bring up a search menu. \n\n-Type in Pixel and you'll see a bunch of options like pixel buds (2017), pixel buds 2020, series-A, etc but nothing for the Pro's. \n\n-I'm sure it will have them added in a few days. \n\n\n\nIf you want to use a present Graphic Equalizer in the meantime, you may need to pay for the app. (I bought it in 2020 so I can't remember). \n\n-To turn on the graphic equalizer, look under AutoEq and click on the name graphic equalizer. \n\n-It has a bunch of presets with the default being flat, but you can create your own personal equalizer settings at the bottom of the menu. \n\n\n\nHope that helps!","172":"Wasn't really sure what you were talking about til swapping back and forth between my pixel buds and APPs. I'm no audio expert but the APPs' sound seems richer on these videos. I hadn't noticed and honestly don't know if I would have if I didn't go looking for the difference.","173":"Btw, what color did you get?","174":"Excellent! Welcome to the club!","175":"No need to apologize - I appreciate you taking the time!","176":"Yeah spatial audio is due to come later this year to the PBP along with the graphic EQ. \n\nI'm hoping it'll come with the launch of Android 13, but it's more probable that those features come with the launch of the Pixel 7 & 7Pro.","177":"Nice! Was worried I'd have to use a cable or get a new charger","178":"Hah, that was going to be the first thing I tried. Good to know it'll work.\n\nedit: Wait this is from April 2020. Assuming everything's the same design\/dimensions as before, it *should* still work, in theory?","179":"I mean it has gotten better since it's first release lol but compared to Carplay it's pretty much garbage. I'm sure it will get better though","180":"Damn Google really going for 5 babe EQ sliders, didn't expect that.","181":"Will do, thanks!","182":"Do you turn on pixel's volume eq and boost bass?","183":"I'll check it out, thanks!","184":"Holy shit. I've been using custom presets via Wavelet for roughly a year, but had no clue that a PB preset existed (PB-A in my case.) Thank you, random reddit stranger. They sound great!","185":"I'm with these guys, Wavelet transformed my Pixel Buds from mediocre and disappointing to very good. My Bose cans definitely sound better, but my Pixel Buds with Wavelet are the best ear buds I've ever used (minus the occasional annoying pairing issues, but I blame that on shitty Bluetooth on my P6P). \n\nKinda sucks you need an app to get the most out of them, but they really do transform when you install it and get your EQ dialed in.","186":"Sounds good! I did try that Auto EQ but it actually sounded more trebly than before, so I will wait for the PBP Auto EQ release! Hopefully will be out soon!","187":"Omg this is amazing, gave up on Android EQ since like 2015 when I remember they disabled it or something. Now my qc35iis sound so much better!","188":"That helps, thank you!

But I can confirm that wavelet is close to accurate.","210":"I played with the multiple pixel buds presets available and settled on the \"Pixel Buds 2020\" preset as it was much more subtle, and \"brightened\" the highs just enough to add a significant amount of clarity without it sounding tinny, or making the mids\/lows sound muddy. Of course YMMV since everyone's ears are different, but the A-Series present did sound a bit more subdued to me as well.","211":"I did try that but it didn't make anything different on YouTube, which seems to be the main culprit right now.","212":"That's basically called as sound staging. Different earphones have different levels of sound staging and most of them try to mimic the sort of staging where you should feel as though you are in an orchestra or something like that where there are many instruments playing at once and you are able to identify different instruments based on the direction of sound.","213":"Yes! So you're experiencing the same thing I am! Thank God I'm not going crazy.","214":"Here you are sir!\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dybI6dB","215":"I'm using AA every day for several hours and I'm really happy with it.

Although I'll be getting my Pixel buds Pro so it'll be obsolete later XD","217":"Did you enable the dump permission and notification access? If that doesn't work then dang lol hopefully the fall eq update fixes it","218":"It isn't bothering me as much as it sounds like it's bothering you though.

I'd like to see how different the fog color is from the white color of the case","222":"Well for one, you'll need batter to make porterhouse0's bday cake! ;)\n\nSecond, carplay doesn't seem to glitch out as much as AA, at least from the experience I had a year ago for about 4 years straight on my Honda civic hatch. \n\nFrom what this user is saying, it's not changed much.\n\nWhat type of phone do you have That has it run so smooth?","223":"Just the dump permission for now. I do hear a few of the EQs making a bit of a difference, but still the same high treble type of situation. Sounds like further optimization is needed for the YouTube app with the pixel buds Pro as a whole, but again not sure since I'm not a software engineer.","224":"Compare that experience to a song like this, and it's like day and night difference in regards to audio quality:\n\nhttps:\/\/music.youtube.com\/watch?v=5Eqb_-j3FDA&feature=share\n\n(It's an Indian song but still you'd be able to appreciate the dynamic sound)","225":"Good eye!","226":"Thanks! No worries!","227":"Sure, just added to the Imgur share. I did some pics against different backgrounds so you'd get a better idea.","228":"Using a Pixel 5 most of the time and I rarely have any glitches, except it's getting too hot in the summer.","229":"The pixel buds pro are very new, but if you wait a bit, the app will update with a profile specifically for the pixel buds pro.","230":"Ok ya it's pretty different. The Airpod Pros >>> Pixel Buds Pro when listening to this song. \n\nI'm really hoping this is something they can improve with some firmware updates.","231":"Looking forward to that!","232":"It'll honestly be a bit. I think when I got the Samsung Buds Live on release, it took a couple weeks for the update to come out for the ear buds.

Isn't there a user here that works for google, an escalation \/ reddit request? I can't remember the details but someone else will.","237":"This is unacceptable. Can't even imagine how a company like Google can have this kind of customer support. I recently switched from an iPhone (after being an iPhone user since 2009) to Pixel 4 and now waiting for the Pixel 5 to arrive, but seeing this kind of threads I just hope I won't have to deal with Google's support. Apple is straight on point when it comes to customer support and gets your issue sorted immediately. No escalating the issue if not needed and no multiple agents involved in the case. Just simple. I hope your issue will get sorted soon.","238":"That sounds so frustrating!\n\nI'm curious about whether reported issues with Google's support vary by country? I've had nothing but good service in the UK, but I don't know if I've just been lucky, or if the UK customer support people just have their shit together. The fact I've had to RMA three Pixel phones sucks, but at least getting a replacement has been quick and easy each time.","239":"This kind of customer support is often seen in cash strapped about to bankrupt companies who wants to extract every penny do evil types. \n\nGoogle, get your shit together!","240":"Google store support is a nightmare. My pixel 5 is great, but bought an accessory I wanted to return under the 14 days no questions return policy. OMG, 5 hours, so many chats and emails later, I've given up. Never got the postage labels. Life's too short, I'm going to sell it on eBay and take a $20 hit.\n\nTerrible experience, strongly advise to buy from other retailers with decent support and returns processes.","241":"Maybe Google customer service is managed by AI. That\u2019s why is so un-human.","242":"Google has the worst customer support I have ever dealt with","243":"Google does not deserve your money.","244":"Can you contact your bank and cancel the transaction?\nI buy things like this on a Bank of America credit card because they are BOSS at refunding my money and going after the offending company for me.","245":"Having dealt with Google customer service with both Nexus and Pixel devices, stuff like this is why I always laugh when people on the OnePlus sub say they're moving to a Pixel because of a bad customer service experience.","246":"It's like Google support and OnePlus support are both fighting to be the worst customer service companies. Strangely, Google is winning. Hope you get your issue resolved OP","247":"Is this all through chat support or phone support? You have to use phone support for everything to get anywhere.","248":"Had issues all the way around like this. With buds going back to launch. Three pairs in total. Finally got it all sorted out this week and got all my money back. Good luck x.x","249":"Guys... I don't think I want to buy a pixel anymore. I'm not even sure I wanna stay on Android anymore.\n\nAll these horror stories with support for a company that wants to be so central in your life.\n\nIt's disgusting really. People jump through hoops to get these devices, after being lead on with shitty shifting release dates for a year.\n\nIt just really sucks.","250":"I contacted Pixel customer service on your behalf I've never had an issue like this bad in my whole time of owning pixel devices since the first one..\n\nHopefully since I own a cell phone store they take some seriousness in this and get you a replacement but if they don't please message me immediately I will do what I can to help you out as much as i can\n\nContact the better business bureau it may actually help","251":"May be you should contact a lawyer and file a suit against Google. And I am not kidding. There is no excuse for a behavior like this.","252":"I guess that will teach you buying from a robot like Google. \ud83d\ude11\n\nIf their product works, it's pretty nice. If you need to customer support from Google, you'll not find anybody. Unless your 'customership' is paying them money, e.g. ads or commercial Google hosted services.","253":"I feel like everytime I don't buy google products, I am dodging bullets lol","254":"Let's blow this up folks, hate to read stories like this and I hope you get your buds or your money back!!","255":"I have had 2 RMA expenances with Google..\n\n\nmy nexus 6p  conatcted them to see if they chould point me to someone for a oow battery replamnet .  They just gave me an adduced rma for a refuib that was less then 100% but at least worked for more then 4 hours.\n\n\n\nMy pixel 4xl recently wireless chargeing coil died  they sent me to ubreakifix  ..  Ubreakifix can't get parts and my 1 year expires waiting for parts.   Google then says they will do OOW mail in but there website refuest to take my imei 2 weeks of holkding pattern..  during witch i got verizon to get me an OOW advanced exchange (My job had me working with people at Verizon who were able to pull strings)","256":"That's so weird coming from Google.  That's definitely something that Samsung would do.  I left them for Google because of a similar experience... \ud83e\udd14","257":"How long is the RMA period on them? I've been holding off and seeing if firmware updates fix the connection stuttering, but no luck so far. I bought them months ago so idk if they'd still be willing to take an RMA.","258":"My Pixel Buds have been on google for month now. I chat with Google once a week. They always say that they escalate my problem somewhere and then.. nothing.","259":"Man when are people gonna stop buying google? I\u2019ve never heard of a worse customer support than google","260":"I had my Pixel 4a order (placed early August) delayed until the end of September. Was working with Google support and had someone from their team emailing me daily saying they were working on. Days after the phone showed up, they kept sending daily emails saying their still working on it and would have an update ASAP. Somehow the phone shipping AND arriving wasn't an update? Wat?","261":"After my Pixel 3 XL debacle, I am not paying for a Google Device through their website. Someone mentioned to buy Google Phones etc. through Best Buy or Amazon. Yes, please do that.","262":"Every fucking time I read post about stolen, broken pixel\/pixel buds, i just want to buy iphone as my next phone instead of my pixel 3xl which didn't had any issues whatsoever for 2.5 years","263":"\\> I still feel foolish and am sorry for riling you all up, but this remains, in my opinion, a colossal customer service failure. \n\nAnd a colossal idiocy of a purchasing decision. Why buy the product, when you already know Google's atrocious record with hardware quality control, including Pixel Buds 1? When you know, before even recieving it and getting QC issues, that Pixel Buds are an awful value compared to alternatives like Galaxy Buds+ (which have far great battery life, better reception, better mic quality, better SQ, and cost $150)?\n\nHearing the Pixel Buds community in here bitch about the Pixel Buds 2 now, when they during and prior to launch aggressively rebuffed, ignored and dismissed constant explanations from others not to buy them, as they willingly surrendered to mindless consumerism by defending their pre-orders, is funny. It was the exact same thing with the Pixel Slate--there too all the early buyers were doing all sorts of justifications about why it was a \"perfect device\" for them--today, the total number of PSlate owners can fit into a phone booth.\n\nNext time around, understand what you're buying into. It's easy and apparent to see the quality of a product in specification alone, sometimes. PBuds 2 was one of those (even more so, as earphones are reliant heavily on good hardware).\n\nI hope it works out for you, and I can't ever imagine being a US citizen due to shitty reasons like these, where you have next to no consumer rights and live at the mercy of private tyrannies (big corporations). But I can't say I'm shedding any tears for any PBuds 2 owners on this sub, as they were very-well informed.","264":"Everyone on this sub has problems when using email. Just stop and fucking call them.","265":"Do a charge back on your credit card. Tell them you have months of documents.","266":"Had similar encounters with them. You really feel alone when it comes down to you and 5 other agents.\nBest of luck and I hope you get your refund.","267":"I've always had a good experience with Google support but I am always on edge when I have to deal with them because of all of these types of posts. I guess it's just luck? Are you in the USA? That's where I am and maybe it's different based on where you live?","268":"I also RMA'd some defective pixel buds. I overall had a good experience but I must admit I had some anxiety about getting the funds returned to my account after I sent my defective item back due to poor communication from Google automated emails. Specifically they asked me to send my defective earbuds back after I already had and you could look up the tracking number for the shipping label to see that the buds were en route leading me to believe I had fell between some automation cracks.\n\nThe individuals who helped me during the process (support humans) were all very helpful and reassuring.","269":"It took about 20 emails and 3 weeks to get that new chrome cast with good TV sent to me. I purchased day 1, delivery notification but nothing on my doorstep. I have cameras, it never showed up that day. Google support treated me like I was a thief and trying to rip them off. One of my emails pointed out how they have probably wasted over $50 in salary just talking to me and how it would be easier to just send me a new one. 3 weeks of bullshit, I didn't think it could happen to me over something so trivial","270":"I've only been in this sub for like 2 weeks and the amount of shitty customer support stories I've seen are astounding. I pray I don't have any issues that require contacting google.","271":"Between Google and Samsung's poor customer service, I'm legitimately considering an iPhone for the first time ever.","272":"Jesus.","273":"Mine took a while, but the $ came back without having to email. Patience.\n\nGot a new pair and they work flawlessly.","274":"They have my pixel 4xl and send me a replacement in a timely manner. Said I just have to wait. Screw them....","275":"Abort! See my edit above. Issue is resolved, though I was never informed, and apparently neither were any of the customer service reps I was in communication with.","276":"Thank you!\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","277":"why are all pairs defective though? it shouldn't be an issue. there is no fix. people buy new pairs and it is still happening? i'm sick of it. i am put off by trying to return them. glad i kept the apple earbuds i got free with something else, because they work and don't cut out constantly","278":"That\u2019s one of the reason why iPhones and Apple products are much expensive while providing similar performance. The Apple tax. I\u2019ve been thinking to foray into Android and Pixel, but I\u2019m hesitant of the customer service.","279":"Except for the part where Apple will tell you that nearly the entire thing needs replaced when it's just a bad capacitor on the board or unplugged cable. Apple themselves state that they don't do partial repairs, it's either all or nothing, that along with the fact that Apple is trying to make it to where 3rd party repair shops can't touch an Apple product without bricking it means that if something goes wrong with your Apple product, Apple is insuring you will pay as much possible to fix it. They are an incredibly anti-consumer company.","280":"I lived somewhere without an Apple store and warranty repair service was awful. Took them far too long to replace a screen with a green line down it. When you looked at the list of parts replaced it became clear that they damaged most of the phone in the process. Basically they replaced almost everything except the battery and cameras. The phone was gone for over 3 weeks.","281":"I came here to say something similar. I had an issue with my AirPod pros about 4 months in , just a little crackling noise during certain songs. Walked in and out of the store in about 20 minutes with a new pair without an appointment.","282":"You forgot to mention that if your Apple warranty is expired you'll have to pay an exorbitant price.","283":"Why is \"Honk\" so funny here?","284":"I've never had any trouble returning or getting things fixed. Usually a two day turnaround with free expedited shipping. All these horror stories are absolutely the loud minority.","285":"That's exactly why I bought my Pixel from Best Buy.","286":"After the issues I had with my first pair of Galaxy Buds that I bought from Best Buy, I always try to buy my tech from there. The first pair of Galaxy Buds I had, had a messed up battery so I took it in, within the return window and they exchanged it for a new pair no questions asked.","287":"Only time I contacted the Google store was when I washed my wired pixel earbuds that came with my phone.  I just asked if they were waterproof or not because I ran them through the washer and dryer.  They sent me a new pair free of charge.","288":"This is the way to go. I'd never buy directly from google.","289":"[deleted]","290":"I just saw this person referenced in another thread and submitted a form. Fingers crossed.","291":"Exactly. Outsourcing is perfect for \"simple\" support, where the user contacts to ask a simple question, but horrible for any real issues.","292":"I used to be employed by a subcontractor who handled google play store support. I specifically was assigned to the shipping and refunds team. AMA!","293":"You gotta take these posts with a grain of salt. Apple users have plenty of their own horror stories. I've been a Google Android user for 12 years. In that time I've had one phone RMA'd, and it was quick and painless. I don't have any complaints.","294":"Just gotta remember that this is probably a one in a thousand problem \ud83e\udd1e","295":"I'm in UK too, and I've had nothing but awful service - I think the quality of service is a bit of a lottery!","296":"Insider view, there was probably a problem with your address so FedEx or whatever refused to generate a label.","297":"[deleted]","298":"The issue is it's all pre done and scripted. They are not allowed to think for themselves or actively solve. \n\nThey pass the real issues back to actual google employees but you're not allowed to talk or reason with them. \n\nIt's a great system for them. Highly inefficient for the customer.","299":"This should be the absolute ( I have nothing to lose) last move as doing this can get part of your Google account suspended.","300":"Won't they just keep you on hold for an hour like the chat does?","301":"Where I'm at. Have Hello doorbell, Nest thermostat, wired cameras and many hubs and minis. Picking up my iPhone Saturday..","302":"Pixels are great. Google Store is what sucks. Don't buy from Google. I got my Pixel 3a from Best Buy.","303":"> Contact the better business bureau it may actually help\n\nIt won't, the BBB is basically the mob and extort money to give good ratings.","304":"Small claims all day.","305":"This is the type of thing where you may be able to get your state's attorney general's office involved too. I had a similar situation with a bad laptop 18 years ago and even the mention that I was beginning to reach out to the attorney general's office made them act quick to resolve my problem. Not sure if that would work here.","306":"I bought mine through the Verizon store and they were outside of Verizon's return window. But Google's warranty on them is a year. Mine also dropped their connection anytime I turned my head or walked past a tree.","307":"Such a stupid comment","308":"And have your Google account deleted.","309":"Apple is not the most expensive anymore. You\u2019ll pay more for a Samsung phone and the customer service from Samsung is horrendous.","310":"People always say iPhones are more expensive, but anymore iPhones are priced right around most flagships.","311":"It may be horrible but I've had the og pixel and now pixel 3, haven't had an issue really, let alone one that I needed to contact customer support for. That being said, you may never have to experience the terrible customer service.","312":"The Apple Tax means there are stores to walk into...but then they'll charge you the basically full price of the phone to repair anything","313":"Do not do that. Pixel user with other g hardware. Google can't do hw and more and more they suck in software too. Do not give additional money to google by going to android.","314":"Eh it's an issue sure but the majority of people don't RMA things.  And it's not like Apple is perfect either in this respect.  There is a reason Rossman has a steady stream of business and a pretty popular youtube channel.","315":"Any phone company is anti-consumer. Hopefully right to repair gets pushed through within the next 4 years.","316":"Had 2, Nexus 5X's bootloop on me. The return process took 2 weeks after courier picked it up. That's crap","317":"I've said it before and I'll say it again:\n\nGoogle is not a technology company, Google is an advertising company","318":"Good luck \ud83e\udd1e","319":"It's not even simple for that. It's faster to just figure it out yourself.","320":"That's also true, but I tend to believe Apple's way of handling customer support is better than Google's, from what I can see being discussed here and on the other side. I never had any issue with Apple and I had plenty of interactions while using Apple devices. Even when I had a Macbook out of warranty with a common problem which they had a program for, program which also expired, they still solved my problem for free after one of Apple's official resellers in my country told me I have to pay ~$700 to get it fixed. I, then, called Apple directly and they got in touch with the reseller to fix my Macbook for free. That problem implied changing the motherboard of my Macbook. I only commented based on my experiences with Apple and on what's being discussed here now only about the Pixel 5, not to mention other Google devices.","321":"Make that two in 1000 cause I've had a very similar experience as OP. Google support is God awful.","322":"Maybe, but still, Google's customer support, from what I can see so far, is a bit painful to go through. It's kind of lottery: you either have a great experience and your issue solved fast and easy or you have a worse experience and you have to wait weeks or months to get your issue solved, if you even get it solved.","323":"Could be. All I know is an end user it is a terrible system with no feedback and no support. Compare to Amazon - integrated returns, customer service that actually helps you - it's no comparison :(","324":"This made my day haha xD","325":"You may be relieved if I tell you, that as for now, the google AI system is learning about this conversations, and may improve the algorithm to run the customer service. Let us know if in two days you have your problem solved.","326":"Wow, really? Our home has purchased 8 Pixels and 2 sets of buds. We've had Google Fi since Pixel 1 launched. That information is enough to put my Google spending on FULL STOP. Thanks for letting me know.","327":"i always wondered why the google store requires ID (!!!!!) to buy from it, these fuckers want to prevent people from using alt accounts to buy stuff.","328":"Pixels are great. Google Store is what sucks. Don't buy from Google. I got my Pixel 3a from Best Buy.\n\nThat said, I would avoid other Google products that require services like Nest. Not necessarily because of customer service, but because I don't expect that them to support that long term and that's something you want supported long term.","329":"I am in the same exact boat and want to switch, but I love the integration with the Google assistant. \ud83d\ude2d","330":"Holy shit mine also drop if I turn my head or open my mouth. I might have to give the RMA a shot then.","331":"Lol duh.  Who the hell doesn't secure their contents of their accounts? Make a new one, life goes on with your money back in your pocket.","332":"Yup. iPhones have gotten more competitive, or should I say other brands are now matching Apple lol","333":"Depending on where you live i guess. I've had nothing but good and quick experiences with Samsung Australia. Even only 3 days to repair my one month old Note 10+ and all they have here is a kiosk lol. The mainboard had failed and needed to be replaced.","334":"And their software is just shit. Granted it's better post touchwiz but not by much In my opinion. I finally have a pixel and granted the hardware is not at good but it's not a 1k phone either. Samsung software is not even in the same league.","335":"Yes, 2020 prices for 2017 performance.","336":"Damn, I understand. I\u2019ll be holding on to my iPhone and will closely watch how things progress. I might get a Pixel 4a as a secondary to just dip my toes.","337":"Nowhere close to perfect, but much better than companies that sell at comparable quantities. Especially when you look at the diversity of Apple products and the fact that their will most likely be an authorised repair centre at most major cities. Yes, it\u2019s super expensive and costly, but the option still persists.","338":"This is absolutely true and why I don't really understand the whole argument about this brand vs. that. They all suck and unless we force them to do the right thing they won't. Best way is to pass legislation. It is the tool we as citizens have to hold corporations accountable. Let's f****** use it.","339":"They always ship it first for me.","340":"Check out Louis Rossman on YouTube. He runs an independent repair shop in NY and has rant after rant of how Apple screws its customers. There's one video where a customer's screen wasn't working. Genius bar told her she needed a new logic board (their typical answer), when really it was just a loose internal cable.","341":"Make that three please. It's the reason I jumped ship to Samsung.","342":"Apple does it too, most companies will stop doing business with you if you do a charge back against them.","343":"Pretty sure you can download the assistant on apple phones","344":"Yeah, it's not that apple brought their prices down, it's that others raised theirs. Most for no reason other than because people are dumb enough to pay it. \n\nThere was one android phone, I don't remember the brand but the phone was a 2019 flagship (hardware wise) and was something like $3000 for a god damn cell phone.","345":"Actually Samsung and other Android device manufacturers are able to get dumbasses pay Apple prices for their products that are nowhere close to Apple's value when it comes to total cost of ownership which includes support, ecosystem and resale value.","346":"Idk where you get that from. I have a iPhone SE 2020. It\u2019s the fastest phone I\u2019ve ever owned. AFAIK iPhones processors outperform most android. iPhones usually only lack a crap ton of RAM, but why do I need 12GB of RAM in my phone?","347":"If your talking about speed, the A14 chip beats anything on android right now.","348":"Lots of people who use Pixel are switched from iPhone, they can all tell you: NOPE. Go try rendering a 4K clip on any available Android phone and compare it with even the last Gen iPhone and see the difference, kiddo.","349":"Bruh what. Apple SOC's blow the best Qualcomm chips out of the water. I'm a Pixel user and performance is the single thing I miss the most from my iPhone days. They are optimized insanely well.\n\nA 3 year old A12 and 4 GB of RAM on an iPhone performs better than a Snapdragon 865 and 8 GB of RAM on any Android lmao","350":"That + they will continue to repair even the oldest of devices! Usually a screen repair from apple is pretty competitive to the guy next door.","351":"That's... That's not how odds and statistics work.","352":"I was just reading accounts from Google and Apple users who got bans for TOS\/Charge backs. What a fucking nightmare. I hope we do something to dismantle these corporate giants soon.","353":"It's not as smooth. You have to create a shortcut to have Siri invoke Google, and then you have to tell Google your command.\n\nYou have to say \"Hey Siri,\" wait for the beep, say \"Ok Google,\" wait for the beep, and then say your command. On the Pixel, you just say \"Ok Google, do this\" and it works.","354":"Maybe the slaves in china factory are fed less provisions, saves money with slave labor","355":"I had an SE before my pixel and it was junk. Eventually I was caught in a rainstorm and the speaker stopped working after getting wet, game over.","356":"On my Note, I can plug it into a keyboard, monitor and a mouse (although the phone works as a track pad) and it runs a Linux desktop then and can operate like a PC.","357":"Depends if IG Reddit and FB are all you do all day.","358":"As does last years A13.","359":"It's a 30 second or less difference.","360":"Add me in it too, this is my experience with approximately 30% of the 70 or do Google devices.","361":"It may not be how odds and statistics work but I've had 3\/3 bad experiences with Google support and I'm kind of just done. Actually, anyone I know who's dealt with their RMA or support has had the exact same issue. Their devices work great until they don't, and then it's a problem. \n\nThe Google store and RMA is an industry standard for uselessness and poor service.\n\nMakes me wonder if Google isn't coming out and saying it but there's a reason they can't sell a $1000 phone, and are now releasing cheaper versions and limited options.\n\nGiven their track record with products and services that are dead now, it wouldn't surprise me if Pixel went the way of the Ara.","362":"I could probably live with that. I mainly use it to turn lights on and off. \n\nOh wait I have all these speakers to do that. I'm good.","363":"I wish other phones would do that. I wish they didn\u2019t kill Linux on Dex.","364":"But you have to admit most of the average users out there don't use phone the way you use it, not to mention they don't buy flagships. Of course you can live a desktop-like life with Dex but would it be a good Desktop\/laptop experience? I highly doubt it.","365":"Yeah, it's called an iPad. They've been able to do that for years. Not to knock the note, it's a great phone, but it's so humungous","366":"I do wish there were more emulators.","367":"and the a12 if i'm not mistaken lmao","368":"Even with just 10 seconds, that is already a lot.","369":"Wow, 30% of the things you try from google fail? Sounds like you should just stop using them if you're having that bad of luck.\n\nI on the other hand, have had very, very few problems that resulted in excellent customer service from them.  This is the point u\/tomtom792 was trying to make.","370":"Thanks for compiling these reviews and formatting your post so it's readable! Appreciate it.\n\nI'm in the market for my first ever set of wireless earbuds, so this post is very helpful. Might pick up a pair this fall alongside the new Pixel phone.","371":"Just got home and opened them. First impressions these are by far the best of the three attempts by Google. Set up was simple and straight forward on my P6P. The ANC was really quite good, had the tv on and couple air purifiers and instantly couldn't make out either. The pass through was really good for the brief moment I had it on that as well as music and TV on. Will say they definitely seem larger, so if you have little ears it may be a bit tough to keep in. Sound was better than the A series I'm coming from , noticed that immediately. So far so good, but will report hiccups as I use more.","372":"I read the ArsTechnica review first, they did not have anything nice to say about the sound quality.\n\n\"Bass lands more clumsily with an excessive, mix-altering \"thump\" quality. Highs and trebles never sit in the correct place.\u00a0These crucial sonic elements often sound muffled, typically with Buds Pro smoothing over the twinkle of a cymbal or the sharpness of a synthesizer tone. Yet other high-end sound effects often receive an unnatural emphasis, like the pounding of a kick drum being drawn out in a piercing manner, as if a shoe is directly stomping on my ear.\"","373":"The fact that fellow Redditors aren't here in overwhelming numbers panning the hell out of it, has me curious. Granted, I'll be best served to wait after a month, and I'm in no rush anyways.","374":"Question about how the Pro's feel in the ear. \n\nI can't stand how \"stuffy\" most ANC ear buds make my ears feel. Even with the ANC turned off, they seem like they seal so tight that every step I take when walking reverberates in my head. The Jabras I tried were so bad I could even hear my heart beat when I had them in. \n\nI love the way the Pixel Buds 2 feel in my ear. Not the fit, per se, just how I never get that stuffy feeling. I'm wondering what these will be like?","375":"I'm perfectly okay with them not being the absolute best on the market, we didn't expect them to be due to the price, but they are undercutting their competitors in price and they are still getting very favorable reviews. They'll be the perfect upgrade for me personally as I'm currently on the regular buds 2. Not sure why Ars Tech is a standout though and their experience was so much worse than others, but who knows. I'm still looking forward to getting them!","376":"Seems like the reviews are generally positive although they aren't the best wireless earbuds on the market.","377":"Why aren't the big YouTubers putting out reviews for this one? Not one tech YouTuber review out yet for what ever reason. MKBHD had an easier egg in this iPad video today where the pixel buds pro were in the iPad screen on his top view table so I guess we'll get a video soon. Maybe they have that shitty embargo or google didn't send em review units or whatever. Looking forward to Flossy Carter's real review of this thing","378":"Multipoint is such a big factor in me having made the switch from my old Buds 2 to these. They're also way more comfortable than something like Sony Wf-XM4s which would not be possible to wear all day compared to pixel buds (2, A-series or these new ones)\n\nI just got mine yesterday and although (idk why) I miss the wings, they do fit perfectly fine in my ear and the ANC is quite impressive too.","379":"I just got mine, I miss the ear wings.  They are definitely not nearly as secure.  I have the best fitting tip and they are very comfortable, I miss the security on the old wingtips.","380":"If anyone has the Sennheiser TW2 ear buds can you give your comparison. I already have a guy that says he will do it but he has to wait till Monday until the pros are received. Wondering if anyone else has them to offer a compare as well.\n\nThanks","381":"So they're great sounding earbuds for the casual user that can appreciate good sound? \n\nI know I take LDAC for granted since I can tell a difference with lossless tracks between my Galaxy Buds Pro, AirPods Pro, and my Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros that support LDAC. \n\nAlso no EQ settings is a turn down, since that's why I love my Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros so much. They're normally base-heavy (V curved sound) but with the correct EQ they become one of the greatest sounding earbuds I've used, especially for <$150.\n\nI'm very curous about the A-Series though since those are coming with my 6a. Heard they were surprisingly good for $99 and I need a second pair as a backup.","382":"Mine are at my doorstep, I'll know more in about 3 hours haha, but the reviews all seem to give me hope.","383":"Any tips on the fit? I'm worried that either my ear canals or too small or these earbuds just have a loose feeling. I currently own some WF-1000XM4's and I had to buy some 3rd Party Extra Small eartips to get a snug fit, but they get uncomfortable after an hour. These Pixel Buds Pro seem really comfortable, but they seem like they lose seal (almost like my ears are forcing the buds out) after 15 minutes and feel a bit loose in my ear without falling out. Ordered the Comply tips but I tried those with my XM4's as well and even the smallest one was too big for my ears.\n\nedit: context","384":"Got my buds this afternoon, tried them out while making dinner and chilling on the patio later.  Tomorrow is the true test - I live in a city and I plan to go wear them while I walk around.  Hoping the connection spottiness of the previous ones are gone.  \n\n\nAlso, holy shit the live translation feature is AMAZING.  I had no idea it did it both ways, too - can't wait to try this out on my trip to Italy\/Greece later this year.","385":"I am really annoyed at the lack of content surrounding Windows PC connectivity testing. It will connect easily, sure, but what about latency? \n\nPixel Buds A series had terrible latency while watching video content on a Windows machine and literally none of the earbuds\/earphones that I tried had these issues, including cheap 20$ Realme and Oneplus neckbands. \n\nI have read a couple of people complaining about this latency in the PBP as well, and if that is the case, mine are going straight back the day they get delivered. \n\nCan anyone share their experience on this? For reference I am using a laptop with inbuilt bluetooth 5.0 and Windows 11.","386":"[removed]","387":"I've had mine for a day so far and I like em.\n\nComing from the Pixel Buds 2, EVERYTHING is an improvement. Pixel Buds 2 at launch was ROUGH.\n\nCall quality is clear and people can hear me well on the other end of my calls.\n\nThis my first pair of earbuds with ANC and I'm pretty impressed. My only other point of reference is a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4. The cans are obviously bigger and can do transparency mode better than the Pixel Buds but the Noise Cancelling is like 70% as capable as the Sony's.\n\nI'm not an audiophile but sound quality on the Pro's pack a little more oomph than the Pixel Buds 2 do.","388":"I have never paid more than like $50 for a set of earbuds before. I'm blown away by these. The transparency mode is really useful. By far the best I've used on any device (all others were headphones not earbuds). ANC does a great job on the white noise kind of stuff. Sound quality is better than any other buds I have, and I'd be pretty annoyed if it wasn't. \n\nBut it's the level of comfort that really does it for me. It's  something I had no idea was possible. That's in spite of the fact that I could really use a size smedium ear tip. I really forget about them and they really do alleviate the plugged ear feeling. Obviously comfort is totally dependant on your ears.\n\nMusic makes a big difference in helping me to focus, and between the comfort and the very good transparency mode these open up a world where I might legitimately wear them all through a workday. This is probably a couple year old news with other manufacturers' offerings, but it's new to me and I'm excited about it. Whatever other possibly better options there might be for similar or less money, I'm feeling like these delivered exactly what I was hoping for. So far.","389":"Got mine about 30 minutes ago. My biggest complaint so far is that they're just plain not comfortable to use, compared to my Galaxy Buds+. Maybe my ears are just shaped weird, but comfort was the same problem I had with the Pixel Buds 2, and these aren't much of an improvement. The eartips actually kind of *hurt*. I'm disappointed that they removed the wing tip to help secure them because there's just a lot of extra pressure on the ear canal. Plus without the wing tip, I'm never really sure that I have these inserted properly either. The Galaxy Buds+ are incredibly comfortable and I could wear them all day. I'm kind of bummed because the Google Assistant experience on the Pixel Buds is a huge improvement over the Galaxy Buds+, and that alone was enough to convince me to buy these. I'll guess give these a week and see if the situation improves.","390":"Ars Technica giving a shady review? I'm shocked! (Not)","391":"Looks like for the most part, positive reviews.  Mine's at home waiting for me, super excited to try it.","392":"Does anyone who got the Buds Pro also have\/had the Galaxy Buds (2019)? Im thinking of upgrading from my Galaxy Buds but wanna hear from someone who has both before making a decision.","393":"And it will getting eq and probably improve with update hopefully","394":"Anyone else have em and have low volume for phone calls?  For media like videos, music and podcasts it's loud and clear but very low for phone calls.  I can't figure out how to go in the settings and change up configuration after initial setup up either.  I'm on a pixel 5 if anyone knows.  I can only toggle the 4 basics in the Bluetooth settings.","395":"Should I get if I already have the pixel series A buds?","396":"Most of the reviews' comments about things they like about them are the stuff I was looking for in a new set of earbuds, my current ones are a bit long in the tooth now and they're nowhere near as good as premium offerings available today so I think I feel comfortable with my choice to preorder these. Definitely making me wish they'd get here now instead of in a few days!","397":"I haven't read anyone else complaining about it, but it really bothers me that I can no longer use the case magnets to secure it against a metal surface.  I would continually make use of this around home and work with my A-series buds, but no dice with the Pros.  \n\n\nOtherwise, I am really enjoying the Pros so far and find that the ANC\/Transparency mode has worked wonders.","398":"Overall I'm liking my Coral Pixel Buds Pro!","399":"I've been struggling to find a good fit with mine. My ears are apparently too small. Waiting to try the comply foam tips, but if that doesn't work I will be returning them.","400":"The ANC is great. I have a sound machine that runs static noise, and it goes completely silent when turning on ANC. \n\nHas anyone noticed a high pitch sound when using one bud in ear?","401":"Have any of these reviews mentioned the frankly ridiculous amount of latency these things have? Returning mine today because watching video other than on YouTube, on both my phone and PC, is unbearable because the audio is out of sync. The sound of typing on the Android keyboard is also out of sync as are the sounds in any apps where button presses make noise (i.e Duolingo). \n\nI paid a similar price to these for some Jabras a couple of years ago and had no problems. Unbelievable that these would be released with such a glaring issue.","402":"Why leave out the cons for the Ars Technica review? Talking while masked was muffled And inaudible. ANC not very good. Audio quality not as good as it should be.","403":"so I have original Mint Green Pixel buds, what do the pros do differently that I should switch?","404":"With Google ditching the wings I doubt I'll be able to wear them. My Pixel Buds-A stay in quite well, even doing physical activity. I've tried Airpods and Airpods Pro and was never able to keep either in my ears. After trying several different tips and aftermarket tips, I finally gave up.","405":"Am I crazy or is there not an app for settings? Do I have to really go to settings and search for buds to access the \"pixel buds\" app?","406":"Would love to hear someone speak to how they do with calls when the user is riding their bike or in a car with poor soundproofing. I have the Pixel Buds (2020) and Assistant really seems to struggle to trigger and my wife constantly has trouble making out what I'm saying.","407":"Loving the buds and there is a new firmware pushed today. Once the firmware is installed, the earbuds sounds different. Anyone knows what had changed?","408":"They'll give these away free with the purchase of a Pixel 7 during its first week of release, I guarantee it.\n\nIf you're buying a Pixel 7 but are unsure about these hold off for another 2 months.","409":"My fit test passed with the large tips, however when wearing these out on the bike they work loose. Even had one pop out.\n\nAny recommendations on replacement tips that are more secure?\n\nAlso have the Buds 2 with wingtips and prefer those for the security.","410":"I think I want to buy these!! Anyone know if the sound leaks through the buds? In other words, can people around you hear your music while you are using them?","411":"The Ars Technica review calling out mic quality makes me question whether they even tried a pair. Best mic quality across any buds or headphones I've tried barring headsets with detachable broadcast mics.","412":"Just to chime in, the new updated firmware (finally got today) does not fix the horribly muddy and thudding bass, and the full EQ is still not available. The older wireless (non-A) Pixel buds are noticeably more natural and flat, with solid bass that doesn't overwhelm the mids.  \nI do \\*not\\* understand the \"these sound so much better\" thing unless people are looking for Beats style thudding\/muddy bass. These in their current state are not crisp at \\*all\\*.\n\nAs an early adopter of the original wireless buds, I expected it not to be perfect, but I did expect better than this.","413":"Seems like mostly good to very good reviews with one fairly bad one thrown in.  I wonder if the Ars Tech guy had fit issues?  \n\nOne complaint I've seen more than one place is call quality, although people generally say it's ok, just not great.  Curious to hear more on that from users.","414":"Hello,  \n\n\nI want to buy them but being a cyclist i wonder how easy the ANC is to turn on and off? I have the a series but i find accessing their controls is a pain.\n\nIs there a widget or a menu complication that lets you turn that on and off easily?","415":"I'll stick to my pb2s since they actually work. Once they crap out I'll look for a sale.","416":"[deleted]","417":"What benefits of using Pixel buds (vs other brands) with Pixel phones? Pardon the elementary question but I haven't found the answer by searching. thx","418":"I love my airpod pros, and I will not apologize about that. They're the only apple product I use. \n\nI didn't want to like them, but they're that good, and for a reason. \n\nI just never have any issues with them, and it seems like there's already issues with these.","419":"I have paid and they so much better then Pixel Bud 2. Great job","420":"Im waiting for them to go on sale.  I would guess christmas time.  2X the first gen pixel buds seems like a huge jump.","421":"Does anyone know if these would work wirelessly and seamlessly w\/ the Shield TV out of the box? I saw them show off a demo that mimics what Apple does with AirPods and an AppleTV.","422":"Jabra Elite 85t user here. How would the Pixel Buds Pro compare to the Jabra? Better, similar or worse?","423":"Can anyone confirm if they will stay in when putting on a motorcycle helmet ?","424":"Sorry for my ignorance but will the update that brings spatial audio allow pixel devices to play Dolby ATMOS content on Tidal and other apps?","425":"Im having trouble getting the eartip seal check to work im using the largest ear tips and it still tells me to reseat them or use the larger ear tips which i already am. Any advice?","426":"Is it easy to \"drop\" active connections? For example, on my Jabra Elite 7, if my phone and tablet are already connected, and I want to switch to phone + computer, I have to manually disconnect from tablet. Which is especially annoying if tablet is in another room or floor. I'd like to be able to drop active connections from the headset itself, so I can connect different devices.","427":"All i want to say about these ear buds is that they are not that great. Shipping took forever unexcusable, but back to the product. The ear tips hurt! The small is too small for a good seal and for it to preform it's test. The medium just hurts after 10 minutes of use. The sound just sounds muddy the pixel a series have better sound in my opinion. At 200 bucks this was a complete disappointment.","428":"Just got mine. Had to switch to the smallest tip. They feel like they are not very secure in my ear.  Anyone have any recommendations to fix that?\n\nPackaging and setup was a breeze with a pixel 5. They came on and my phone immediately prompted me to set them up \ud83d\udc4c","429":"I'm totally frustrated on how bad this pixel buds pro sound in comparison with the pixel buds 2 :(","430":"These are garbage. They come loose constantly and the touch function makes it so securing them will randomly pause, skip, change volume etc. Honestly hate them.","431":"I've had these since January, and I can't recommend them due to their fit. They just refuse to fit well because of how shallow the earpiece is. I've tried various tips, including aftermarket ones, but they're just too shallow. Wearing them while running is a huge pain because they work their way out after 10 minutes or so. Otherwise, I think they're a pretty good product, but the fit is a deal breaker","432":"Enjoy the journey to pick some!  I have lots of pairs and the nothing ear 1\u2019s are okay at the price but the 1More Evos are pretty amazing. Those are my daily drivers.","433":"[deleted]","434":"Four attempts! Buds, Buds 2, A-Series, Buds Pro.","435":"Are they more or less comfortable than the a-series","436":"Tbf, I kind of feel this, and think it might have at least something to do with the codecs. I have the Galaxy Buds 2, a Pixel 5 and a Galaxy Tab S6. I don't really listen to the Tab S6 very often, because of the form factor, but when I do sync to it, there is an immediate sound quality difference over the Pixel 5. They connect through different codecs, the Pixel AAC or SBC, the Tab S6 through Samsung's scalable codec. There is a discernible difference immediately. \n\nHopefully the Pixel line, both buds and phones, support better codecs soon.","437":"Never heard anyone complain about bass slam on a headphone review before. That's normally a plus.","438":"It reads completely like personal preference of the reviewer. Unfortunately that seems to be 95% of what Ars writes these days and I've lost interest.","439":"Lmao they really get creative when they get paid by the word count","440":"There is a eq now","441":"I don't experience the stuffy feeling, they're very comfortable on par or more comfortable than the 2s in my opinion. The seal isn't perfect which I think is by design. Obviously everyone's experience will vary because we all have different ears.","442":"I had the same problem, these are noticably larger like I can feel the outer bud in ear at first, but then after about an hour I completely forgot it was there with ANC on. The stuffy feeling seemed somewhat diminished.","443":"I have that issue with silicone ear tips in general.  I buy foam tips made by Comply for my AirPods Pro (and multiple pairs of wired in-ear headphones) and love them.  No more issues with a stuffy head.  I don't want to post a link, but just search for 'Comply foam' and there are custom Pixel Buds Pro foam tips right on their homepage :)\n\nE: Just be aware that you lose a little bass because they don't seal like silicone tips.  It's the trade-off for not having a stuffy head!","444":"I'm not too deep into that field but on their website they said something about the earbuds  equalizing the pressure in your ear to not have that feeling, so it may be that.","445":"I had the Buds 2 and received my Pros a few hours ago. I honestly love them so far. I feel like the ANC is exactly what I needed and they're incredibly comfortable compared to the 2s in my opinion. I can see myself wearing these for hours at a time whereas with the old version the stem thing would start to bother my ear after about an hour workout.\n\nI'm not an audiophile so I really can't be a good judge of what's supposed to sound \"good\" but the noise cancelling alone makes this a worth upgrade for me - especially when it comes to wearing them at the gym, on the subway and on the plane (I feel like the plane will be the true test of it's effectiveness). So far I've only tested in city streets and the park.","446":"I expected them to have above average overall performance with the best Google Assistant experience. That's exactly what we got.","447":"It seems like all the reviews taken together tell the story that with a couple of promised updates they will be competitive with, if not a little better than, their primary competition in several categories.\n\nTWS earbuds are always all about different tradeoffs so there really isn't a perfect pair for everyone, rather everyone seems to have the pair that is perfect for them and their use case. For example, I'm still using Buds 2 despite the problems they have had at times because they work for me. But I can also admit they aren't ideal for many people and they should have been designed better.\n\nWhat I'm looking for from the Pros is something that works kind of like the Buds 2 but is more reliable, has ANC, and integrates just as well with my Pixel.","448":"This comment was deleted due to Reddit's decision to effectively shut out 3rd party developers.

I'm surprised to see MKBHD and LTT (especially since they spent so much money recently on the head and torso simulators) skipping on the review for these. Hopefully, they get to it at some point.","450":"Coming from jaybird vistas that fit rock solid, are super light, and don't move at all, I wish these had a fin. They don't fall out, but do have some movement when running due to not having anything stabilizing against the ear. \n\nGoing to try comply foam tips to see if that helps at all. Really fit, or lack of a secure fit\/feeling is my biggest complaint. EQ is coming, but sound pretty good out of the box, noise cancellation is pretty good, Google assistant works great, multipoint, etc, just not the best\/most secure fit unfortunately.","451":"Hi, what did you decide eventually? I'm comparing wf-1000m4 and pixel pro's, multipoint would be the big factor but the box or pixel is sooo nice and tiny","452":"I don't have the second gen, but I do have the first gen. Here's my take: The Senny's do sound better. But not by a whole lot. You are getting more fullness, soundstage and detail with the TW's. That being said, I don't like the dark sound profile of the Senny's and I ended up EQing the heck out of them to be more neutral and slightly bright. They handled this EQ perfectly and now I think they are pretty hard to beat in the TW space. A note, I've had these for around 2-3 years.\n\nOn to the Buds Pro: \nThey're great! Google did a fantastic job here. It's hard to go up against some of the best and be comparable, let alone win. But that being said, I brought out a lot of detail with the Senny's after EQing them, I'm hoping I can do the same here. ANC is a nice bonus and all the new features really make for a better overall experience. \n\nPersonally, I would wait for Wavelet to get updated to support the Buds Pro profile and see what people say then. I have hope they can come close to the Senny's after some tuning.\n\nConclusion:\nFor me, I use Audeze LCD-2Cs when I want great sound, so taking a slight hit with my TW Buds I use for walks and stuff isn't a big deal. However, if you have Senny's already, keep them and wait for a Wavelet update and people's opinions on that, unless you plan on using them casually like I do. \n\nCheers!","453":"I've been a devotee to my TW2s for a few years now, and got my Pixel buds yesterday. \n\nPixel buds are getting returned. I'm getting sound latency issues on apps that I've never had any issues with before.","454":"Apparently EQ settings are coming in an update.","455":"I have A-Series buds and Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros...\n\nThe A-Series are really great. I got them free with my Pixel 6. I find the A-Series are more comfortable and I prefer them for calls. The case is smaller and better if I want something more portable. I'm also really into the A-Series sound for the price, esp. with a few notches of Bass increase. Unless I'm listening to music or need ANC, I typically go for these over the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros.\n\nAll that being said, I really love the EQ customization options on the Soundcores and they really just sound incredible. If I'm listening to music, I want my Soundcores as I hear things in music that I don't hear listening on other devices. I actually prefer them to my over-ear Sony WHH900Ns, which admittedly are older and not high-end, but still...\n\nI'm really curious to hear how these Pixel Bud Pros compare to the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros. If an earbud had the comfort of the A-Series with the sound quality of the Soundcores and class-competitive ANC (better than the Soundcores), I'd buy.","456":"You can download Wavelet for EQ settings rn. Works with all headphones\/earbuds","457":"I got the series A with my pixel 6 and I love them. I never even touch my Jabra elite 65t anymore. I don't have any high end earbuds to compare them to though. I do have the 1st gen Sony MDR-1000x, and don't use those much either because I prefer earbuds.","458":"The A Series really are great for $99, but I'm considering upgrading to the Pros.","459":"I'm liking them so far. Going to the gym in a bit so I'll be able to really test the effectiveness of the ANC there.\n\nEdit: ANC works very well, it doesn't block out all the noise but the music the gym plays was almost silent and I couldn't really hear anyone talking. They also never felt like they were gonna fall out","460":"Mine feel secure in my ears and aren't too uncomfortable so far like my galaxy buds pro were. I think they need some eq though. They're too bass heavy for my liking, and I'm a bass head.","461":"It took me years to figure out that I needed to use the smaller tips on my earbuds to get them to fit comfortably.","462":"That sucks, I don't have issues with fit on my end (they don't move when I'm running). Curious what did the \"fit test\" say? Hopefully the comply tips help.","463":"I have the same issue, it feels like my ear 'concha' is not big enough to fit the buds so they feel like they are hanging out of my ears.","464":"How do you get live translate to work?","465":"I got the latency issue on the PBP, and they're getting returned because of it. It sucks. They're otherwise a great earbud\u2014 I find them very comfortable, I like the ANC, and they sound great. But all of that is irrelevant if I can't use them to watch TikTok.","466":"I am curious about this too. While my 7+ year old Jabra Revo works great with my Windows PC and Android phone (including multipoint), my brand new Jabra Elite 7 Pro has latency issues watching videos on the PC. So I'm shopping for the Pixel Buds but don;t know if that will solve the issue or not.","467":"I just got the PBP and am experiencing latency \/ connectivity issues with my Windows laptop (Dell XPS 15). I also have 2nd gen Pixel Buds, and they have the same problem.","468":"How would you describe the difference?","469":"Do you hear a hiss when using ANC? I wondering if mine a defective or that's just how they are.","470":"I thought the Transparency mode was significantly better in the PBPs. Or at least, a better experience. The better isolation on the Sony cans make the transparency mode do more heavy lifting and feel less natural. In my experience anyway.","471":"They're definitely not for everyone. I find them very comfortable but my girlfriend couldn't stand them at all. I found that making sure you're using the correct silicone tips helps a lot. I usually wear mediums and sometimes those are a big small but the large are perfect on me with these.","472":"That's disappointing as someone who was hoping they were more comfortable than the Buds 2.\n\nMy issue with the old buds was that to get them to sit well I had to twist them in my ear really tight, it would start to get painful after like half an hour and prolonged use even led to ear infections in my case.\n\nI was hoping the Buds Pro would be better for this since they didn't have the wings, but it sounds like maybe it isn't...?","473":"waht. They're sooo comfortable for me. I'm wearing them now and can hardly feel them. Are you  sure you're using the right sized buds?","474":"I am genuinely curious why Google Assistant is important to you. We have a dozen or so Google Home devices all over the house. They used to be very useful, but over the last few years they have become so utterly passive aggressive and ridiculously clueless that I have all but given up to use them for anything. And that also trickles down to my phone. I don't ever use the Assistant because it always results in me cursing my phone after a while.\n\nWhat have you found where Assistant does a good job?","475":"What makes their review shady?","476":"I have Galaxy Buds+ and I love them but the Pixel Buds Pro are better in every way possible. I'm very impressed.","477":"I had galaxy buds pro for about a week. I wanted to love them but could never make them not hurt my ear. The fit just didn't work for me at all. The PBP are definitely more comfortable in my ear. \n\nIt's been 6+ months since I've heard those, so my memory of their sound is fuzzy. I think the galaxy buds pro were better tuned out of the box. But I just made a few adjustments to the graphic eq in wavelet (to turn down the bass and lift the upper mids) and I'm pretty happy with the PBPs. For reference, my normal desk headphones are Audeze LCD-2s with a slight bass boost.\n\nI think the PBP have slightly better ANC, and the Buds Pro had better transparency mode.","478":"That's really a personal decision, do you want the added features enough to warrant the price? I came from the A-series and I am happy, but I wanted ANC+transparancy and the A-series were not super comfortable to me. Oh and multipoint is awesome! The sound quality is also better, but I feel like it's not leaps and bounds better.","479":"Active noise cancelling is the main one, spatial audio support in the future, transparency mode, multipoint connectivity.","480":"You're right. On the Pixel phones, the pixel buds app is integrated into Connected devices\/Bluetooth settings section. You can put a shortcut on the home screen though, it's under more settings","481":"If medium size didn't work for you then I'd try to order the Comply foam tips.","482":"I've talked to 2 people with them so far. One a regular phone call and one on Duo. They both said they heard me very clearly but were still able to hear the conversations of other people near me in the park. So in my experience it seems pretty similar to the buds 2 - it doesn't do a great job directing the mic only to your mouth, but the background noise isn't distracting either.","483":"There are two easy ways. The first is the easiest and involves you touching one or both of the buds (configurable) for like 2 seconds to toggle anc and transparency mode. The second requires you to have an android (or pixel device I'm not sure I have a pixel). When you press the volume rocker there is a toggle on the phone.","484":"I don't get why nobody uses it. AptX Adaptive especially sounds just as good as LDAC (if not better in some circumstances) but with the lowest latency which means I can use it for gaming and even live music.\n\nOn my Qudelix 5K AptX Adaptive sounds incredible and it baffles me that it isn't standard on everything wireless in 2022.","485":"That's a really good question actually.\n\nDid you get answer ?","486":"If they just auto-paused on Android, I would be an airpods pro owner.","487":"Honestly I wouldn't be surprised to see them on sale during Black Friday. Even brand new Pixel phones get discounted on Black Friday, and they come out in October.","488":"The Buds 2 were $180 at launch, so the Pros are only $20 more. The Buds A series are the $99 ones presented as a budget option.","489":"As someone who used to use buds constantly on a motorcycle, I highly recommend installing a motorcycle comm. system (I use Cardo and love it) and buying some good quality ear plugs (I use the Ear Peace and theyre amazing). The ear plugs block sounds like wind but allow music through so you protect your ear drum and everything just functions way better. And then on top of that you can connect to other riders if you want.","490":"You can't drop connections from the buds themselves, just your phone's Bluetooth menu\/app settings","491":"I use nothing ear 1s and man the Bluetooth was buggy and unreliable and frustrating earlier this year\n\nit's calmed down a bit but im open to buying something more reliable\n\nbut the ear 1s are so stylish and also lightweight and comfy. they're the first \"IEM-style\" earbuds I've tried in years that don't hurt.","492":"Honestly... simplicity I guess.\n\nI have a Pixel 6 and will upgrade to a Fold 4 soon, but you know what I like with the pixel lines or earbuds? No proprietary bullshit.\n\nMy A series work on my workcomputer to watch stuff on the train on business trip, they work on my desktop computer if I forget to charge my QC35, they work on my personal phone obviously, and they work on my (professional) iPhone.\n\nMeanwhile, if I were to get the new Galaxy Buds with my fold, while I'm sure they'll be better soundwise than the pixelbuds, that would also mean installing a PoS software on all my non samsung devices.\n\nFuck that.\n\nAs a bonus, having an android phone as my main device, I also get the best integration of Google Assistant.\n\nSo yeah, in straight-up sound quality they're not the best, but if you have multiple device they're incredibly convenient to have.\n\nEdit : and multipoint is just bonus at this point.\n\nI'm at work? Desktop+iPhone\n\nI'm travelling? Android+iPhone\n\nI'm chillin' at home? Desktop+Android\n\nI'm spending the night at a hotel for work? Android + Workcomputer","493":"Oh god...I forgot about the first buds hahaha","494":"For my ear shape these are actually more comfortable. Even though they are larger they seem to rest better in my ear.","495":"Yesss!!","496":"I'll have to try this out since I have a similar but different range of products. I use Galaxy Buds+, and have a Pixel 4a 5g along with a Galaxy Tab S6.   \nAnd like yourself, I don't use the buds on the tablet that often due to its size and frankly I like the speakers quite a bit anyways.","497":"How are the buds 2? I have a 30% off code from buying my 22 ultra and was going to use it on them. I currently have the pixel buds A series.","498":"I much prefer this to 'audio is fine'.","499":"How else would one write a detailed review? Someone can read this and go \"eh, doesn't matter to me,\" but either way the detail is appreciated","500":"Sam Machkovech has been at Ars for a decade as Tech Culture Editor. He doesn't get paid by word count.","501":"it's actually the opposite foam tips seal better than silicone which is why most people like them for working out and it actually increases bass response normally","502":"Are there any other tips other than the comply compatible with the pixel bid pros? The comply shipping time estimate is absolutely crazy and the large silicon tips are too small for my ears.","503":"I've had them in for 7 hours and it's way more comfortable than the Buds 2","504":"That's good you like them, I'm really excited to try them myself. Unfortunately I can't get them until late next week because that's when they'll be in stock at retailers near me. Kinda annoying but it's not a big deal.","505":"I love my buds 2, but call quality is shit. Every other Samsung buds was okay to good for me (buds, buds+, buds live), but with buds 2 I can't call because each time people complain about quality. Same story for my wife. Ordered pixel buds pro.  \n\n\nEdit: sorry, thought about Samsung, not google :)","506":"That's funny because I haven't had the best Google assistant experience with the previous pixel buds.  Whether it's the \"something went wrong\" response, our sitting idle after trying to touch-activate it, or with spoken notifications being pretty broken (they just stop after a time), it's been pretty poor.  Hopefully the pros have improvements.","507":"Thanks for the detailed breakdown. I've been with Senny's (yeah I'm going to use this now because I always mess up the spelling) since when my wife bought the OTE version (v1) from there I've had all versions, all free mind you (best buy fucked up with their warrenty and I would get the new version for free with extra money left even after buying warrenty again sadly they don't offer warranty anymore for them lol). I currently use the OTE ones for home use when I really want to be about sound. The TW2 are for when out and about.\n\nI never heard of Wavelet and the fact that you got better sound from the EQ makes me want to spend more time with the settings, I'm lazy and never actually calibrated them lol. In any case thanks, no need for me to purchase at the moment but will be on the lookout for that update you mentioned.","508":"LOL well thats a quick and actually useful review. Thanks","509":"I'm really looking forward to someone releasing a profile for the Pro buds so I can use Wavelet without too much fiddling.","510":"Yeah, like my A series, have the pros on the way. I'm sure I can use A series for backup, running etc.","511":"Earbuds falling out is my current problem right now with my current earbuds. I'm thinking of upgrading to these and hearing they don't fall out at the gym is great to hear.","512":"Fit test indicates the fit is fine, but I tried it both with the small and the mediums which obviously did not fit also passed the test.","513":"I got the Comply Foam tips and now the earbuds actually seem to fit, had to use the smallest tips but they stay much more firmly in place.","514":"Activate assistant on the buds and say speak spanisj","515":"I watched some youtube with mine and they were good, I am happy with them.","516":"No hiss on my pair. I usually have noise cancelling on when wearing the buds and haven't heard any yet.","517":"Switching to the largest tips does help alleviate some of the pain. I still wouldn't call them *comfortable*, per se, but at least they don't hurt!","518":"I think there's two major contributing factors:\n\n1. Ear tip stem length\n2. Earbud shape, particularly the part on the inside edge where it lays flat against your ear\n\nThe stem length is short and stubby, and the inside edge is not contoured at all. Google made zero attempt to make these ergonomic and conform to the shape of the human ear. The Galaxy Buds+ have both a longer stem *and* they're more ergonomically shaped, so they're much more comfortable to wear.\n\nSo far I haven't been able to wear these for longer than 30 minutes without feeling some discomfort, but *man* the Assistant experience is just so so so much better that it might be worth the pain. Or it might at least be worth forcing myself to try and get used to it.","519":"I've tried all three sizes, yeah. It's entirely possible that my ears are just weird or something.","520":"Well, most things. I have a Nest Hub in my kitchen which I use for unit conversions, timers, smart light controls, quick answers to random questions I think of while I'm cooking or cleaning. In my bedroom I have one on my computer desk for the time, weather, smart light controls, setting reminders, etc.. They're just fixtures in my home that provide a certain amount of convenience throughout the day. I don't have to think about using them, they're just there and they work (most of the time). Occasionally they frustrate me as well, sure, but 90% of the time I'm glad they're there. Even just controlling the smart lights in the house with my voice makes me feel like I'm living in the future.\n\nOn my earbuds, I use it for answering quick questions, checking my shopping list, setting reminders, checking the name of the song I'm currently listening to, and whatever else I might think of. Similar to the Nest Hubs, the Assistant on the earbuds is just incredibly convenient for whatever I need it for. It's one of those things where it just seamlessly integrates into your daily life and I love it.","521":"Hello thank you for the feedback ,I would consider putting them on  my wishlist (:","522":"As long as they fixed that firmware problem that breaks my left one every time they do a system update I'm good lol","523":"Thanks for replying, and for the workaround. Very annoying!","524":"So you're saying people hear conversations of people around you but that it isn't distracting enough to be a problem?","525":"thanks a lot!","526":"AptX is owned by Qualcomm and Google just simply doesn't want to have a business relationship with Qualcomm at the moment for whatever reason.\n\nAlso, from what I understand what you really want is aptX HD, which a lot of non-Qualcomm SOC devices don't support for whatever reason. Maybe they don't license it without their chips, I dunno.","527":"Auto paused how? I'm curious. I have a P6P. But I stand by my comment, Airpods are just superior, even if the sub doesn't want to hear it.","528":"Thanks. And just to be clear, I can't drop connections of other devices from my phone, only my phone connection itself, right?","529":"Agreed. Mine are buggy for sure. The Evo\u2019s have been a breath of fresh air.","530":"Also, simplicity in decision making. It just happened I started looking for some premium earbuds right before these were announced. And as many options as there were, none seemed like a clear pick based on a bunch of people's subjective opinions of what's \"best.\" I couldn't settle on one, but the marketing of the Pixel Buds Pro seemed to be targeted directly to me. So they were kind of a dumb \"screw it\" pick but so far they've exceeded my expectations.","531":"The wired buds are best forgotten. Three attempts at TWS let's say.","532":"I think I was the only fan of those first buds.","533":"The speakers on the Tab S6 are shamelessly brilliant. If only it had a smaller delay on the pen I would see no reason to ever upgrade it.","534":"Ive had them since August and love them. Transparency and ANC are both great and I think they sound nice paired with Samsung. I bought them mainly because they are small, and comfort is the #1 thing I'm going for with earbuds. And I think they excel there. Having said that, the A-Series I got to try recently and were pretty comfortable too. If Samsung and Google both support some new codec that's open, with higher bitrate, I'd be 100% happy. I typically use Pixel phones","535":"The way you add detail to a review about technology is doing an actual technical analysis. When your review reads like every other Ars \"lawl Google evil, Google bad, praise Apple\" joke of a tech article these days, I think that says all we need to know about how useful the review actually is.\n\nAnd the issue is that in the OP there are multiple other reviews, critical and non-critical, that are great examples of doing the same thing in a less absurd way.","536":"Yeah, he gets paid by how pretentious he can sound.","537":"That's all I'm hoping for now. Within the next few days Im hoping \ud83d\udc40","538":"I'll wait a little longer, looking at the Pixel Watch as well and not sure I want to spend money on both since the A Series are still so good. Biggest worry I have is people saying the Pros fit different.","539":"If you have ones from a different laid of headphones you could also try them on the pixel buds as well. I used to have to do that with a pair of Skullcandy earbuds I had.","540":"Feels a bit of an exaggeration. I prefer these tips to the galaxybuds which go far too deep and rigid into my ear canal as others have said, but to each their own! \n\nJust feeling the tips out of ear compared to the prior buds they seem softer to me.","541":"I just wish they kept the mint green color \ud83d\ude14\n\nLooks way better than any of the colors they're offering now","542":"In the opinion of who I talked to, yes. Curious what people will say in an office environment. Perhaps it was quiet enough that my voice was still the focus.","543":"AptX Adaptive is better than AptX HD, same quality without the latency","544":"Automatic ear detection. When you take a bud out it pauses and when you put it back in it plays. The main \"issues\" I'm seeing are missing features at launch (super weak, but mostly features that Airpods will be permanently missing on Android) and a weak set of codecs, especially for something called \"Pro\" (exactly like Airpods). There's also a whole sea of choices that offers the full feature set on both platforms.","545":"I dunno about the APPs but the regular Airpods don't have any in ear detection without a third party app that has to be constantly running.","546":"They were great, but that case....","547":"Never had them but I like the design, especially the case design.","548":"I love them too","549":"Maybe other Ars are like this, but the snippet the commenter above posted is nothing like that. The worst you could call it is hyperbolic, which is over the top to be fair but I do like getting some subjective input like this. Ultimately it helps me reach a decision","550":">Feels a bit of an exaggeration.\n\nNot exaggerating at all. Just how they feel in my ears.","551":"Ok, thanks.  Sounds promising.  I have Jabra 85t's and I get similar feedback on those-- people hear wind and vehicles driving by quite loudly but when I'm speaking my voice dominates.","552":"Ok, thanks for saying that. I'm not very familiar with all the various formats of aptX.","553":"That's weird. My Airpods pros definitely do. Do the Pixel buds do this?","554":"I love the case!!","555":"I just felt like the entire review on Ars was dripping with the standard Ars \"Google is bad and cannot make anything good\" type of attitude that is in pretty much all of their tech industry content these days. The quote itself isn't that bad but Sam has absolutely and by far the most critical review of the PBP out of any site that's posted a review. Even the ones who didn't like them much aren't as negative as the Ars review.","556":"\"Google made zero attempt to make these ergonomic and conform to the shape of the human ear.\"\n\nHyperbole isn't helping your credibility.","557":"They have in ear detection, yes. So they pause things when you take them out for example. My regular Airpods keep playing when I take them out if I don't have some app running. I can't remember the app since I haven't used it in a couple years now.","558":"I mean, what do you want me to say? They're shaped like fat pills, and they're not contoured at all. It doesn't seem like they made much of an attempt to make these conform to the shape of a human ear.","559":"Il struggling to find a reason this would be useful. I listen with one earbud a lot and I love how they seamlessly sync back up when I put one back in. What other things do the Pixel buds do?","560":"It's for when you take both out. Or one if you're only using one. I'm not sure if there are other features that don't work right still.","561":"Very helpful, thanks! Question, when you are jumping from the pixel to the mac, do you have to disconnect them from the pixel manually and then connect it to the mac, or you can just directly connect the mac?","562":"When it comes to fit, do you typically have any issues with earbuds in general?\n\nDo these fit well versus other buds?","563":"As a runner, what do you use to carry your phone? And can you pleeeeeeeeease link it?","564":"My biggest issue is the hissing or buzzing sound with mine. \n\nI listen to audiobooks majority of the time and it's pretty unbearable with my pair. Music is fine because it can drown it out.\n\nAudiobooks on the other hand is a nightmare. \n\nI've read others spending hours on chat support to get RMA and I'm tempted to.","565":"I will say the separate audio controls are probably not a bug. Some headsets have that feature where the phone has its own volume and headset has another. I have the same experience with my monster freedom over the ear headset. I don't mind it as long as I'm aware of it.","566":"Good review. Question: is there any lag in audio while playing games or playing videos on mobile? Thanks.","567":"Has anyone found a decent case? After a few hours in my pocket there's already bleed from the jeans.[buds](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I0YUGRR.jpg)","568":"Thanks! I plan to use mine with a pixel and MacBook as well and your review is exactly what I've been looking for. \ud83c\udfc5","569":"I'm seeing people complain about hissing, do you experience any of this?","570":"Nice, thanks.  I am planning to get these, but hoping I can get some kind of bundle deal by buying with a Pixel 4a whenever that launches.","571":"I just read your review! It showed up on my daily feed. Great read and can't wait to get mine!","572":"Is the fit in-canal type or more of Bose\/Apple type?","573":"Anyone seeing battery drain at different rates for right vs. left buds?\n\nSometimes I have a 40% difference in power reserve (right draining faster than left).\n\nI am going to watch this more since I just realized that I have firmware 225 this morning.\n\nFor full disclosure, I am only connected to my Pixel 4XL.","574":"This is really illuminating - all your issues are caused by being connected to the Mac. Makes me wonder about other reviews!","575":"\nThank you! I have been on the fence about buying them and appreciate the candid review!","576":"Thanks for the writeup! I'm excited to get mine","577":"Can't wait until mine arrive.  Hopefully today.","578":"Oof. I just went to go buy them and expected delivery would be June 3, about a full month. Guess I'll hold off lol","579":"Hi! Any chance you have a Nintendo Switch and could test if they pair with it?","580":"In your article you mention that the case is at 38% charged after two days. How can you tell?","581":"Helpful indeed! Thanks \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffc","582":"I've been using mine for a few days and it's been a nightmare. My left bud keeps disconnecting when I have both in ear. I can't run, listen to books except with my right ear bud which works well ONLY when the left bud is back in it's case","583":"So *what's the deal* with hands free Google Assistant? Does it or doesn't it??","584":"Good review. \n\nI don't pick up the hissing, but the left bud for me does disconnect with head\/body movement. First 2 mile run was annoying trying to get it to no disrupt, had to be steady and I moved my running belt different position to see if it was the issue. I ended up running looking down to not have it disrupted. I'll see how today goes.\n\nOther than that they are amazing.","585":"Is there anywhere to see this review since it was removed?","586":"I would buy the shit out of these if I didn't already have airpods and galaxy buds. #firstworldproblems I kno","587":"I'm considering the Jabra Elite Active 75t instead of waiting for the pixel bud stock in my region.\n\nTo be honest they get better reviews it looks like, and can connect to two devices which is a big plus for me so I can use them to take calls from my softphone on work laptop.\n\nAnyone used both?","588":"Great review! How does the audio compare to the Pixel USB-C earbuds?","589":"Are you able to hear enough of what's going on around you to feel safe wearing them on runs outside? \n\nThat sealed-off feeling of in-ear buds drives me crazy, but it seems like the vent in the Pixel Buds should prevent that. I want to hear enough of what's going on around me to know that someone walked up behind me or that a car is driving by.","590":"Will the buds still work if only one of them is in you ear?","591":"Great review, OP.  Thanks.  I had the original buds, used for running a little, but I am a pretty sweaty runner and they slid out.   With these, no cord to connect, I am worried about losing them.  They fit pretty tight?  You sweat much?  How does that work?","592":"I've been having this really wired behavior where my buds will be recognized by my device even I open the case, I will put one or both buds into my ears, but when I start playing audio, sound is still coming from the phone speakers.\n\nI get the notification card with my buds info like battery level etc (previously paired with the phone).  I start up YouTube or some other media and sound plays through the phone speakers.  Check my Bluetooth settings and the buds aren't actually connected.  And even when I go into Bluetooth settings and select them to connect, they will k show as connected, but audio still doesn't play through them.  I have to toggle Bluetooth on and off. Anyone getting this?  It's happened on 3 different phones and a pixel slate and is really dumb; never experienced this on other headphones like the Galaxy buds or Bose.\n\nI also had way more random cutouts yesterday and today than the first few days.  Really annoying, it just goes quiet and nothing works.  I have to put them back in the case and reconnect.\n\nReally annoying things.","593":"Do you have a Google home in your house? Does speaking to the headphones fuck with the Google home","594":"How come people can order them? Just says join wait list for me","595":"Great review. It's right to the point with no extra bs to read.  \n  \nCan you use these one at a time? I like to listen to books while I work. The Chinese pair I got now let's me use the left or the right independently.","596":"How's the audio quality?\n\nAlso, is the easy connect only good for pixel phones? Recently switched from pixel 2xl to OnePlus 7 pro for now.","597":"I tried using mine on calls the last 2 days and noticed this annoying sound constantly when others speak that makes it sound like a skipping CD. Factory reset them multiple times today and tried them after the Pixel Buds \"app\" update today but still getting the same issue. Did you experience that at all?\n\nUpdate: Spent 2 hours on chat support trying to get a replacement setup to no avail. Google's inconsistent support experience is so frustrating.","598":"[removed]","599":"Wow this is a very detailed review, thanks! You're the first person who said there was no wind noise while you were on a call. I live in Copenhagen and it's famously windy here, this is the major reason I was planning to skip on the buds but maybe I should reconside them.","600":"My right bud seems to die faster, and even right next to my phone the audio pops in and out sometimes I'm not sure why. I'm guessing the Pixel 3 may have some issues because I can only walk about 10ft away before it drops.","601":"Are they available in Canada?","602":"how's the bass? I really think these are the perfect headphones for me, but i want to make sure there's enough bass to the point where I'll enjoy them.\n\ni'm currently using the [sol republic Jax](https:\/\/www.solrepublic.com\/jax-in-ear-1-button-headphones-i2.html), and have been since my freshman year of high school.  i love that they  form a full seal & with the right EQ, have a really nice thump \n\nI've also used the google pixel usb-c headphones, but only when i have to, there's no seal \/ heavy bass\n\nhow do the pixel buds 2 compare? i get that all ears are different, but how's the seal \/  bass? i know there's a vent, how's that?","603":"[removed]","604":"Not sure if someone already asked this question,\n\nIs it possible to have it paired to two devices simultaneously?\n\nMaybe I worded that wrong, but what I'm trying to ask is can I pair it to my computer and phone, use it for my phone, then switch to my computer without having to unpair anything?\n\nMy current earbuds require me to reset the whole entire thing just to connect to a new device.. I'm hoping that this isn't the case with these.","605":"Does adaptive sound work when you connect it to non-Android devices? \nI use my iPhone day-to-day but have a pixel 2 for fun. I feel like I should be able to enable the adaptive sound on my pixel and then pair it to my iPhone after. Does it work that way?","606":"Anyone seeing random brief audio drop outs? Seems to happen frequently. Usually happen in the left ear.","607":"Great brief review! Thanks for the info.\n\nJust a quick spell check, you spelled feet 'feed' once.\n\nCheers!","608":"I think the main thing keeping me from purchasing these is the fact that they don't entirely seal out ambient noise like normal in-ear earbud. I know that's a feature to keep them comfortable and usable when walking around (which I definitely appreciate) but how would you rate these as potential hearing **protection** when mowing the lawn for example? I see it automatically increases the volume, but does it block out noises pretty well in addition to increasing the volume?\n\nWith how these fit so streamlined in the ear I feel they'd be perfect for wearing under my motorcycle helmet but I just worry I'd need to really crank the volume in order to hear my music\/GPS.","609":"How much did they cost?","610":"[removed]","611":"My buds immediately started to update upon receipt, so I plugged them in and left them to do their thing. Next morning the case would not function at all. I contacted Google, resulting in the usual hour of \"reset this way, reset that way, maybe it's your cable, maybe your Pixel 4 XL cable is bad too, okay all three cables work on every other device huh? I'll elevate to next tier tech.\" Then a week later still no word back. I try to return them, get someone telling me I have a support case open and they'd see what was going on. At that point I wrote another strongly worded reply informing them I sent a request in for a RETURN, not a status update & that my next message would be to my CC bank or PayPal to initiate a resolution via purchase protection. Then suddenly the following day my return button worked.\n\nIn my case at least, the issues that plagued Gen 1 cases and charging it seems have found their way to Gen 2.\n\nHopefully just a bug in this early set, I'd hate to hear anyone else spent a week not getting a response and essentially owning an expensive paperweight that really don't weigh much and isn't much good at that either.","612":"No disconnection need. When selecting Connect on the Mac the Buds make a disconnect then connect sound, takes about 1-2 seconds. :)","613":"Happy cake day!","614":"No that bit of inconvenience is patented by Sony to be used exclusively on its earphones\/headphones.","615":"I've had issues with in-ear buds falling out while running. I've stuck with the USB-C Buds for the longest time because of the cord loop that secures it in my ear. \n\nOther in-ear headphones have been hit or miss. \n\nThe tab on the Buds does the same thing as the cord loop to keep it secure. It didn't feel like they were crammed in my eardrum while at the same time they don't feel loose or like they will fall out.\n\nMy wife and six and eight year old all tried them and overall they fit and felt secure which was surprising.","616":"I don't generally have issues with normal earphone fit.\n\nI can say the Pixel buds were not much different. I did a 45 minutes workout with 4 sets of minute long burpees yesterday and the headphones stayed in the whole time.","617":"I'll add another anecdote here. I've had mine since Friday morning and was continuously frustrated with how good they were in contrast to how often they fell out. I had to readjust every ten minutes or so and there was no way I could run with them.\n\nThis morning I finally decided to spend the fifteen minutes trying out each tip in each ear. Turns out the smallest are best for me. They immediately felt lighter (because they were in place, not barely hanging on), and I didn't have to adjust them again for roughly three hours. I did a HIIT workout at that point and only one needed to be adjusted before the workout. They were still snug in place after I finished.\n\nHonestly now that they fit I feel like I have a new pair of earbuds again. \ud83d\ude02","618":"I have very small ears and I've never been able to find earbuds that actually fit in them without hurting in under 30 minutes. These are a little better. The stabilizer arc wants to slip out on me, I really have to cram it in my ear in just the right spot. I had 2 times where one almost fell out but I think I've got the trick down now.","619":"I use an SPIbelt. [https:\/\/spibelt.com\/](https:\/\/spibelt.com\/)\n\nBeen using it for years and wouldn't go back to anything else. I can't stand if my phone isn't in the center of my body or if it is flapping around.","620":"[removed]","621":"I'm a runner. While the Spibelt is nice, it still bounces and can get annoying. If you want something that feels like it's not there, get the Naked Running Band. It's the only one that doesn't bounce or move. You'll forget it's even there.","622":"I listen to pretty much nothing but podcasts and haven't noticed any hissing either.","623":"Huh, the only time I get hissing on mine (using the pixel 4xl & the updated firmware) is when I load new content on the screen of my phone. So for example, I scroll through Reddit, there is no hissing at all until I click a link that has a picture or video. Then it will hiss until the picture\/video loads and then stops until I load new content again","624":"There was an update to the Buds app this morning. Hopefully that fixed the hissing for you.","625":"Same here with the audiobooks\/podcasts. I typically listen to them on 2x though, not sure if that has any effect to drown out any hissing, but I have had not noticed an active hissing while listening to spoken word.","626":"The buzzing is really infuriating. Early reviews were talking about how it's barely noticeable but I can't help but hear it any time the audio gets low enough","627":"It will be weird if\/when they fix it though, it has grown on me :P","628":"yeah I've noticed this sometimes too, but it seems to be inconsistent for my devices lol. I have a Sony bt speaker and it seems like sometimes the controls are separate and sometimes are linked and I never know which I'm gonna get","629":"I'm also curious about this. 95% of my listening will be for music but I would like to know if I should expect latency.","630":"I haven't tried video games on my phone but watching videos there is no lag for me.","631":"not OP but clearing the storage cache for my BT in settings helped a bit with the audio lag I had watching videos.","632":"I am intrigued by these although they are pricey: [https:\/\/nomadgoods.com\/collections\/pixel-buds](https:\/\/nomadgoods.com\/collections\/pixel-buds)","633":"the official case from Nomad available on the google store looks nice enough if you don't want to wait longer for more cases to come out","634":"Pricey, but: \n\nhttps:\/\/store.google.com\/product\/nomad_rugged_case_for_pixel_buds","635":"After more than a day of pairing with my Mac, for me, coming from corded headphones the experience is totally great when listening to audio-only. If the Buds are selected as the mic input though the audio quality degrades. \n\nThere are a number of guides that I have found that talk about this for various reasons and they all have various ways to make it better, but everyone I talked to through my Macbook said the sound quality sounds like talking on a phone in speakerphone. \n\nHope to have more detail\/tips later.","636":"He address this in the article with a sub heading... The answer is no.","637":"I have neither at the moment to compare. For me, the fit is a balance between completely in-ear (since it doesn't rely on the pad being shoved in your ear to stay fit, and the security of the USB-C \"loop\" earphones.  \n[https:\/\/store.google.com\/us\/product\/usb\\_c\\_earbuds](https:\/\/store.google.com\/us\/product\/usb_c_earbuds)","638":"One of the reviews mentioned this as expected behavior - they should balance out over time.  If I recall, it has to with the buds handing off functions to each other.","639":"I am playing around with my Mac issues more. I am beginning to think it may be some issue with my computer or settings. \n\nIf I am playing in \"audio-only\" (mic selected on something other than the Buds) the audio quality is great. Seriously like they are wired.\n\nBut as soon as I try to use it as a mic things start to sound like robots and weird.\n\nI need to try on a few more devices, reset some things on my computer and play with the Bluetooth settings more.","640":"I wrote the review I would want to hear :P \n\nNot a fan of the typical reviews that really only talk about surface-level things.","641":"Still not for sale on the Canadian Google store :(.","642":"Might be able to get a colored version by then","643":"The Nintendo Switch doesn't support Bluetooth.

Hope this solves it.","646":"That sounds like a defect. Hope you're able to RMA them and get ones that function correctly :(","647":"It does for the most part. I really wish they had a clear way to ask to have all unread notifications read out loud as if you were holding your finger on the Bud. There has to be some magic word combination to do it, I have yet to find it though.  \n\n\nI have found that I can ask to \"Open Pocketcasts\" then I can \"Play\" and it will pick up where I had left off, which is nice. My dream would be that you could open any app, get items read to you on-screen and be able to navigate and activate anything on screen as if you're using a screen reader.","648":"Yea that sounds annoying to have to adjust how you run. For me that would have been a dealbreaker, I run too much to adjust anything. Google has had enough time to test every running and riding style to ensure these things are solid.","649":"How can you even say \u201cother than that they are amazing\u201d when you literally have to change the way you run just to get your headphones to work! This sub is taking fanboyism to another level!","650":"I've edited the post to include the full review, hoping the mods will bring the post back:\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gd9icg\/first_48_hours_with_the_pixel_buds_2\/","651":"Also this. Why did they remove it??","652":"So far so good on this front. I haven't had any issues hearing cars or bikes coming behind me that I wouldn't have otherwise with the USB-C pixel earbuds (which are not in-ear).","653":"I find I still have to take them out to talk to people, I can hear them it just still feels a bit muffled so I don't like it.","654":"Yup. You can use one at a time no problem.\n\nThey both can only be paired with a single device. It isn't possible to use them independently on different devices.","655":"Tons of sweat for me. They haven't moved or feel loose. Totally solid in my ear from that angle even after an hour+ run.","656":"Something about your experience doesn't sound normal. \n\nHave you tried to toggle all the settings when they are connected? HD audio, Phone calls, Media, Contact sharing? \n\nIt sounds like the Media one isn't sticking for you and turning off when they re-connect. Hopefully a \"turn it off and back on again\" helps.\n\nIf that doesn't work I'd try a factory reset. Others here have mentioned how to do it.","657":"I have a few and only once did it answer on the Home instead of the Buds.\n\nI also had an instance when I had them in and wanted to ask and answer on the Home. I had to take them out of my ears to get the Home to answer so my kids could hear it.\n\nI was able to say for some things, \"Play music on the \\[home name\\]\" but not for everything.","658":"Did you look at the white ones? The other colors were still on wait list when I ordered.","659":"Yup. You can use one at a time no problem.\n\nThey both can only be paired with a single device. It isn't possible to use them independently on different devices though.","660":"Audio quality is really good although it is Bluetooth so it isn't going to match the wired headphones as a comparison. \n\nI don't have experience connected to non-pixel phones but I imagine the \"Pixel Buds\" app that is now available makes it as seamless as a Pixel phone.","661":"That is frustrating! I haven't experienced this. Does it sound like the Bluetooth is lagging and then catching up and skipping things?\n\nSome people here have suggested clearing Bluetooth cache:\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pokemongodev\/comments\/8tunel\/gotcha_problems_on_android_clear_your_bluetooth\/","662":"I really wish it equalized the auto coming through instead of relying on all audio already being equalized. Podcasts especially, some are really loud, others are quiet. \n\nI don't have Spotify to test but went between Google Music, YouTube Music, Netflix and Disney+. YouTube Music and Google Music were the loudest. Netflix and Disney+ were not too quiet, but definitely quieter.","663":"I was surprised by the lack of wind noise too. It hasn't been super windy since, but when it was I was talking to my wife and she is pretty honest :P","664":"Something may be off there. The Pixel 3 has Bluetooth 5, which should have a much longer range. Have you tried doing a hard reset on the Buds? A few people here have outlined how to do it.","665":"Comparing the USB-C earbuds and the the Buds, there is more bass in the Buds, or at least more perceivable bass. I think this is due to the in-ear construction. \n\nThey are definitely not super bassy but there is enough there to not feel fake. I really hope they eventually roll out an EQ on the Buds app.\n\nThe seal is good and I opted for the smallest pads so it doesn't feel like it is forced into my ears.\n\nHope this helps!","666":"I was able to try this out with Stadia on my phone. There is definitely a bullet lag. I don't play that many games so this isn't a priority to fix for me. But I have heard others complain about it and hope Google does something about it.","667":"Unfortunately it is not possible. You can use one at a time, but they both need to be paired with t he same device.\n\nSwitching between devices is very fast 1-2 seconds. No need to disconnect the current device, connecting to the new device automatically disconnects from the current device.","668":"\"Adaptive Sound on Google Pixel Buds is only available on Android and requires an Android 6.0+ device.\" per https:\/\/support.google.com\/googlepixelbuds\/answer\/9642077","669":"I've only experienced this twice in the the last two weeks. Both times they were connected to a Macbook Pro. I suspect the Bluetooth on the Macbook Pro is not as powerful as the Pixel.\n\nMy wife tried them with her Pixel 3, she did notice some drop outs but only when she had her phone in her case. It is a thicker case and I suspect that was causing some interference.","670":"Thanks! Fixed :P","671":"I cut the lawn this weekend while listening to podcasts with them and I'd say I have the volume up 20% more than I would in a normal setting. I typically cut the lawn with in-ear headphones (padded kind) and these felt about the same. I definitely was not cranking them up to where they hurt.","672":"really bruh? It 179 usd","673":"Not everyone wants ANC, but if you do, yes, these would not be a wise purchase.","674":"It may be just me but for my in-ear buds I WANT to be aware of my surroundings. Be it walking in the city, working out at the gym, etc.\n\nFor ANC and all of those bells & whistles, I have my on-ear headphones that never leave my home unless I have a flight.","675":"I could not get a good fit with the Sonys. I really wanted to love them, but if they fall out if I move my jaw or swing my head, they are worthless. I admit I do have a weird right earlobe.","676":"Ehm.. someone correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that a huge deal? Don't most Bluetooth headsets require either disabling or disconnecting from the device they are already connected to, or putting in pairing mode, for the switch across devices to happen?","677":"This is really nice to hear. When I first read that these buds don't have multi-point connection I thought I'd just not bother with them because I'm always using my BT headphones on both my phone and macbook. In fact, the pixel buds set up might be a bit more convenient compared to other devices with muli-point connection. My current Jabra 65t's are great for when you're connected to a computer and then a call comes in and it automatically switches over. but other than that, the multi connect can sometimes be a bit of hit or miss. They'll sometimes not play audio from the device I'm currently using because they're locked into the other device (for whatever reason) and I can only fix this by either disconnecting the other device entirely or playing media from another app to force it to switch over.\n\nAt least with a single connect functionality I don't have to worry about the off chance of my buds connecting and playing audio for random stuff\/devices regardless of my intentions.","678":"That has not been my experience. For me, if I do the mentioned steps, then it connects to the Mac and then automatically reconnects to the Pixel. Extremely frustrating.","679":"I had to google what was that! haha, Thanks man!","680":"I beg to differ. Mine simply will not switch over when I leave the car. I'll be listening via bluetooth in my car. Park car, pause music\/podcast source, turn off car. Pop in Pixel buds and they simply will not play audio. I can tap them, it will play and pause it using the phone speakers. I open the bluetoth menu, it shows the buds as active. tap the Pixel Buds on the phone (sometimes that helps activate and connect), still no go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor YEARS (I've had every Nexus and Pixel phone), Google simpy can not handle handing off from one item to another. It boggles my mind, I've tried easily 10 different brands of earbuds and bluetooth speakers and the phones always struggle to go from one device to another. I'm beyond sick of it.","681":"This is one of the main things I was worried about. In-ear style that has the rubber inserts like these have always pushed\/wiggled their way out of my ears. Makes earbuds almost impossible for me to use generally without something extra to keep them there like the cord loop on the USB C or original Pixel Buds","682":"You guys\/gals might be into [Kippo shorts](https:\/\/kippo.com). I've been running in these for a few years. They have a patented phone pocket. They may seem pricey but I'm on my 3rd or 4th pair now and they are totally worth it. No bouncy flippity floppity phone. My Pixel 2XL with a grippy case fits in there pretty snugly. Plus they're super comfortable & lightweight.","683":"I got them day 1. As a runner, I haven't had any issue with them falling out. They seem pretty secure. Maybe it's just your ears?","684":"Maybe I have a defective unit like others. It's really loud in the right ear and softer in the left. It's a constant noise when an audio is playing.","685":"OH, awesome! The buzzing is a LOT lower \/ less pronounced now from my phone. It's still pretty noticeable from my PC but I've been using them on my phone a lot more frequently. Definite QOL upgrade","686":"It's interesting, because when I got mine on firmware version 159, I made sure to check them for buzzing and there was none whatsoever. Zero buzzing during music, silent portions of audio streams, etc.\n\nBut then when they updated to firmware version 225, suddenly I hear the buzzing in absolutely everything and not all music is able to drown it out. The worst part is YouTube and Reddit, where the auto-play previews are silent but they still must trigger an audio signal because it triggers the buzzing.\n\nI have hope it can be fixed by a firmware update since firmware version 159 had no buzzing for me, but I've seen other people say 159 had buzzing for them and 225 got rid of it, so I don't know.\n\nEDIT: Got the Pixel Buds app update this morning and it virtually eliminated the buzzing. Totally impossible to hear with any kind of audio playing, and you have to focus REALLY hard to hear it when it's silent.","687":"Like all Google products though they only get better over time!","688":"How has this been going for you, any tips with the Macbook? Got my buds today, connected to my work Macbook Pro, had some weirdness depending on if the buds were selected as an input device or not. I do need to use them as an input device though - curious if you've learned anything new...","689":"Yea I read it afterwards. Ok so if I see this in my pair I guess the answer will be to RMA them.","690":"They have been draining at \\~5% difference between them all day for me. Sometimes it will be the left, sometimes the right, but they have been equalizing over a few hours.","691":"Yes. The Verge wrote this.","692":"I don't think we call them that anymore.","693":"Nah, I only order pure white electronics. Like them to feel futuristic.","694":"Correct. When connected to the phone it shows the power level of the left, right, and case in a single row.","695":"I didn't see any reference to this in the documentation. Mine works, I just have to open the case, then connect the Buds from the BT menu.","696":"Thanks for that, I went ahead and gave that a shot and did the bluetooth dev trick. Hope it works.","697":"It was the first and only run I did with the pixel buds. They worked flawless all day for every other activity\/feature, except for that.\n\nAnd again, other than being disrupted on my first run, they are amazing. Try them out yourself. Compared to my galaxy buds+ and bose, I'll stick with these.\n\nAlso can't understand the fanboyism thing. I use all sorts of tech. Just use whatever suites you.","698":"Rule #4. I thought it was only about \"no profiting from or masking links\". I didn't realize it also meant \"no self-promotion\".\n\nSince I linked to my own site, this is self-promotion. I changed it and they were good to revert it.","699":"Thanks for the reply!","700":"Interesting. I'll try them out","701":"Oh that's perfect. Thank you. I normally only use my phone anyway.","702":"It isn't lagging, it just sounds like a skipping cd. TBH it seems like whenever there is something that could be perceived as a higher pitched noise is getting clipped. \n\nMost of my phone calls have been with folks walking outside or talking via speakerphone or computer microphones. Whenever something like wind or someone saying the letter S seems to trigger the skipping\/clipping noise. It certainly seems like software is doing this but based on the fact that I haven't seen it posted anywhere it may just be bad hardware.\n\nThey ended up approving the replacement so I will try it out next week when the new ones get here and I will update my comment.","703":"sweet, thank you! I've been using the Spotify EQ so hopefully that would still work\n\nI want to try them out before I buy but I cant imagine how \/ when that would work lol","704":"Ohhhh!!! That exactly explains my question. I am a very complicated person, and I may have worded my question incorrectly. But being able to switch between my devices fast was my concern. 1-2 seconds seems insane. Thank you!!","705":"Just had another question while watching MKBHD. He said there's an ongoing notification that displays battery life, but I want to know if that does anything to the battery life. Have you tried this?","706":"Thanks!","707":"Valid question. There's no mention of price on the UK store","708":"So true. I thought it was a bummer when I saw the Buds didn't have ANC. But after keeping them in while walking between rooms with my wife or kids trying to talk to me it would be a hassle to keep taking them out.","709":"SAME! I feel really anxious when I feel audibly sealed off from my surroundings. I also have a pair of ANC on-ear headphones for airplanes and the office when I really need to focus.","710":"IDK, I have the Echo buds as well, while I literally got maybe 2 minutes of use before my case was dead & no longer recognized, the Echo Buds have pass through you can turn on and off and adjust. Best of both worlds.","711":"[deleted]","712":"[deleted]","713":"My 1st gen Galaxy buds doesnt need that too. Once u pair for the first time I only have to turn on Bluetooth on my windows pc and it switches connection from my iPhone to the PC. But if i need to reconnect to the phone i have to turn on Bluetooth and connect manually","714":"AirPods don't (Pro or non). You can switch between any devices that's been paired whenever you want.","715":"I've definitely never experienced that with any Bluetooth device I've used, just connecting to a new device automatically disconnects from the old.","716":"Depends how old of Bluetooth device you have. For example 2.0 won't allow you. I think 4 and up will","717":"It's not a concern if it's already paired with both devices. If it connects to a NEW device without a pairing mode that's a problem.","718":"It's called Multipoint I believe. I had Bluetooth headphones back in 2008 that had it. All the sets I have now have it as well.","719":"My Jabra 65t and 75t both maintain two connections at once, with the first connection being primary. If the primary device isn't playing audio, the secondary can instead. No reconnections needed.","720":"Bluetooth Multipoint support can allow for multiple devices being connected to the headphones at once. It's rare to find in true wireless headphones because they already have to pair to each other and the phone. The only buds I could find that supports this in the current generation was the Jabra 75t. They can pair with up to 8 devices and connect to two devices at once, but can only play sound from one stream. Not spectacular, but let's you skip all the constant re-pairing.","721":"Hmm.. I haven't tried the car yet. I'll do that today and update here and the post. \n\nWhen you turn your car off, do you open Bluetooth on your phone and click to connect to the Buds?   \n\n\nMine won't swap back if the current device turns off, but manual switching doesn't require a disconnect, the new device just takes over.","722":"Confirmed switching back after getting out of a car. Here is my experience:\n\nGoing and an out of a car with Bluetooth. I have a 2009 Ford Escape which is typically paired with my phone. I tested having the Buds paired with my phone, listening to a podcast, got in and turn on the car, the car picked up the Bluetooth and the podcast started playing inside. Looked at the Bluetooth settings and it said two devices connected. After turning off the car the podcast paused, Bluetooth disconnected from the car. Noticed the Buds were still connected but it was like they were in sleep mode. I couldn't control anything on the phone or unpause the podcast until I took one out of my ear then back in. That seemed to have reactivated it as the primary media output. After that, it worked like normal.","723":"Not OP but I recently got mine in the mail and I had the same concerns as I always have issues with in ear buds falling out but these are SHOCKINGLY secure. I've been on several bike rides and runs with no issues and don't even realize they're there.","724":"Yeah that\u2019s no good. I\u2019d try to RMA.","725":"I have the same issue, right ear hissing left ear no hissing.","726":"I wish I tested the buzzing before upgrading to 225 :-\/ \n\nI hope this is something they are working on and can cancel it out with software.","727":"Unfortunately I've resorted to only using the Buds on the Macbook Pro for output, and using an external mic for input. Not the best but there is totally something up with the Mac Bluetooth input that automatically degrades the Bluetooth audio output. I really hope they fix that, especially if Apple plans to put out their own over the ear Bluetooth headphones. :-\/","728":"The answer is that ~~be~~ he does experience hissing but only when connected to his Mac","729":"Thank you!  I didn't have time to go back through all the review articles and vet them today, so thanks for digging this up!","730":"It's definitely buds of color these days","731":"Ah yes, and the future much like the past is only black and white","732":"You are good then. Mine stopped showing case after first forced update & without the case being seen you cannot pair to anything else PERIOD. That was my case. Instead of shipping a replacement, they put me on a semi-permanent support wait-list for tier 2, or as I like to say, the return window removal service feature. I swear, they do that just to say oh, u wanted to return? Sorry, 14 days is up, yours now sucker...\n\nHo-hum... At least my P4XL is solid and the Echo Buds work well. I ride a cholo'd Deluxe Harley with loud fishtail Samson mufflers & I can hear my tunes with those, even without a helmet. Guess I'll wait for Pixel Buds 3 or at least a rev. or two before trying again. \ud83d\ude35","733":"Did it work ?","734":"So odd. Glad they approved the replacement and hoping for the best for you!","735":"This would be very hard to test. The notification comes up when you first connect but I typically swipe it away, I don't find it has any value. \n\nYou can get to the information pretty quickly by swiping down the drawer and clicking the Bluetooth icon, it will tell you the percentage of each Bud right under their name without any extra click.\n\nDoubt either would drain the battery unless you had your screen on all the time and you were constantly checking it.\n\nI've used these things so much in the past week and haven't found an issue with battery life.","736":"That adaptive volume thing is pretty nice, too.","737":"Yes, I know that. I did try that. It fits OK, and stays in, in my left ear. But even after reading the instructions closely and following those instructions, I could not get a good fit in my right ear. My right ear always does MUCH better with a fin (except the Jabra Elites seem to work fine).","738":"Interesting. So there's a few headphones with this behavior. I wish reviews would flag this kind of stuff. It is DEFINITELY not all BT headsets that have this kind of smooth switching behavior. Which is a big reason why I have been obsessed (until now?) with my Jabra's ability to simultaneouly connect to two devices at the same time.","739":"Really? I need to try this","740":"Right. I am aware of that, because when they came out everyone made such a huge deal about that advantage that they have. But if according to this thread, every modern Bluetooth headset has that behavior anyway, then that \"advantage\" was overly stated as it is essentially non-existent. That's what I am trying to figure out.","741":"Now that is a cool feature, I haven\u2019t heard of that before. Other earbuds require you to go in the Bluetooth menu and initiate the connection. AirPods have this feature but only between iPhone and Apple Watch.","742":"Thanks for dong that. Yes, I've experienced that also. I've had situations where no matter what I did, I just couldn't get the phone to see the buds as the primary device to use. Some days I have to turn off Bluetooth, then turn it back on to get it to pair and route audio correctly. Then I'll go a few days where it works pretty smoothly. Then for no reason, same morning routine, it'll just malfunction again. At this point I don't blame the buds or any other headsets because I've had it happen to too many different devices. It's definitely the phone\/Android system. It's the one major bummer for me in what has been many years of loving Android.","743":"Is there any way do downgrade firmware version? The buzzing seems noticeable only since the 225 update on my end.","744":"So I've been using the pixel buds for the past 3 days with a MacBook pro for all of my online meetings for work. Like other Bluetooth headphones I've used with the MacBook pro, Apple degrades the sound quality when it thinks you're going to use the headphones as an input device. The way I've been getting around it is having the pixel buds set to output only most of the time, and only setting them to input during meetings","745":"Yes, I haven't been able to produce a hiss when connected to the Pixel 3 XL, but do hear it when going in between things on the Mac or when stopping audio. Not using it more there is like a 3-4 second static that is audible then it goes completely silent. It is like there is still some buffered audio that then gets cleared out.","746":"It's just a personal preference man. I'm not going to buy something expensive (and technically unnecessary) if I don't like it.","747":"It was definitely better, for the first 15 minutes they worked flawlessly, then the left one threw a fit for a few minutes but began working again.","748":"Awesome!! I've turned off Motion Sense and 90Hz on my 4XL and the battery life has not improved. But hoping that these Pixel Buds will be worth it!","749":"I honestly thought this was just how Bluetooth worked nowadays. I have several earbuds\/ headphones that just switch over when I hit connect. Didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been lucky to avoid the old disconnect to connect hassle.","750":"I think a lot of premium buds will have this sort of feature. There's sometimes confusion about headphones or earbuds being paired and being connected. My Pixel Buds 2 are paired with my phone, my laptop, and my Pixel slate. When I take them out, they're connected to my phone automatically, so if I want to use them on my computer, I go to my laptop's Bluetooth settings and choose to connect them and it effectively \"steals\" them from my phone. \n\nMy TaoTronics over ear headphones don't do this though. I have to go to my phone's Bluetooth menu and disconnect the headphones before I can connect them to my computer, which is already paired. \n\nI think it never gets highlighted in reviews because this process is supposedly smoother and more seamless with Airpods and iOS\/iPad\/Mac over Pixel Buds and Android\/ChromeOS\/Windows (I don't own Airpods to give a fair comparison). As a result, I think if the switching isn't as smooth as Apple's solution, it just doesn't get mentioned. Though I have seen reviewers talk about the ability to pause media on one device and play on another, and the earbuds being able to decide to switch on their own. I personally don't know which have this ability though. \n\nSorry for the long response, end of the day, I think the Pixel Buds 2 are great and they're great with multiple devices. To me, they're an easy recommend if you have an Android device, especially since the gestures work on Android, ChromeOS, and Windows, surprisingly.","751":"Airpods behave the same way as the Galaxy Buds (I have both) and the Pixel Buds it seems. The Airpods and Galaxy Buds do not have the ability to connect to two devices. Maybe that's the deciding factor?\n\n\nHonestly, I prefer 1 connection at a time. I have Sony extra bass headphones and having 2 devices fight for those headphones gets confusing. I use multiple laptops, a phone, a tablet, and other devices with the headphones. Having to determine where to disconnect it is a huge hassle. I think that is one of the major source of confusion when it comes to Bluetooth devices.","752":"Most cheap ones don't have that switching ability.","753":"I don't remember anyone making a big deal of the feature but maybe I missed it. Most bluetooth headsets (and all that I've owned) work this way.","754":"Not that I have seen, but some people have mentioned a way to do a factory reset. Which may bring it back to 159 but I can't confirm.","755":"I *may* be wrong but I think they were making a joke. Like \"hindsight is 20\/20\", people look back on history and see things very black and white compared to how those issues felt living at that time.\n\nI *think* that was the idea being co-opted into \"past and future being black and white\" as a joke here, but I may be wrong and this user may be lamenting that electronics only come in black and white for the most part, as you thought.","756":"Day two and back to spotty audio. I'm tossing the towel in and getting a refund I think.","757":"Which headsets are those? Unless it's a BT5.0 thing that I missed or something, I'll be extremely confused. If nothing else, one of the big touted benefits or the W1 chip by Apple on the original Airpods was their reconnect capabilities.","758":"I've only ever had one pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones and I don't even need to hit connect to change. For example, I'll have them connected to both my laptop and phone simultaneously, be listening to audio on my laptop, answer my phone when it rings, then they'll go right back to my laptop audio when I hang up without any sort of manual intervention.  Bought these for $30 years ago (Phaiser BHS-530 for the curious) and I'm disappointed to discover it's not the norm.","759":"Here's where it gets confusing for me. I have the Jabra 75t and B&O H9i. I think most eougl classify those are premium.. at least given their price range. They also both support true multipoint which is quite rare (especially the Jabra in the in-ear category). And yet, neither of them supports the kind of easy switching described here. I'm fairly certain that my Sony WF-1000XM2 did not either. So this kind of seamless switching doesn't seem to me to be as widespread as this comment thread is making it out to be.\n\nI wish there was a list somewhere classifying headphones around their device switching behavior so this point would not be as uncertain as it is right now.","760":"Sounds good. I did try factory reset and it didn't downgrade firmware unfortunately!","761":"I'm pretty sure this is just tied to how many paired devices a headset supports. My Sennheiser HD 4.50BTNC are Bluetooth 4.0 but supports up to 8 paired devices and I can swap between them easily by initiating the connection on the next device.","762":"I've got a pair of Sony headphones (MDRXB950BT\/B) that switch with a simple pair in either BT menu. I switch from my Pixel 3a to my Dell laptop to my desktop very quickly. I bought these in 2015, so I don't even think these are BT 4","763":"My old Pixel Buds and my AirPods both have this multiple connections feature. It actually works faster on my Pixel Buds than my AirPods even with Apple\u2019s supposedly fast H1 chip.","764":"Yeah, I don't think it's as common as the comments are making it seem. I had a cheaper pair of earbuds that couldn't do it either, and my girlfriend's gen 1 Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless aren't particularly smooth with device switching. \n\nThe Pixel Buds have the best experience I've seen on non-Apple ecosystem stuff and I think it should be mentioned, maybe some of the bigger names will give them credit (MKBHD, LTT, etc). \n\nBut yes, it would be cool if these high end earbuds worked with Windows the way Airpods do.

I guess I'm confused then by the other comment saying its only gonna receive a 5W.. which after reading your comment seems really really good.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nEDIT: Unless he was actually talking about the CHARGER??","868":"As I mentioned in another reply, I did some searching through the database mentioned in the article and found the following:\n\nAirPod wireless charging case: 1.1 W\nAirPod Pro case: 1.7 W\nAKG N400: 1.5 W (not much info on this product, registered same day as pixel buds)\n\nThere is no mention of either of the Galaxy bud variants. As for the picture of the comment about asking apple, it seems to be cut off so I can't really read it, but my guess is it charges at 5W from a lightning cable, but less when charged wirelessly as the only wireless charging standard supported by the AirPod\/pro is Qi (based on Apple website)","869":"It's also pointless. The charging will have roghly ~500mAh. My Pixel at ~4000mAh charges fairly quickly at 10W, so by comparison, the pixel buds will go 0->100% 4 times faster than the phone...","870":"There's a sort of war about perceived value, especially about value being associated with physical objects. I got carried away so sorry for the wall of text...\n\nGenerally in the tech world, especially the cellphone world, exploding prices have long been justified by the use of more expensive tech and parts. More ram, better chips, that sort of thing. This has largely been supported and emphasized by the entire industry, even including reviewers and tech journalists. It's concrete, easy to understand, and in it's own fashion, it makes sense as an easy barometer to compare different products objectively. I think the apotheosis of this thinking has resulted in the new Samsung phone that's $1,400 where everyone had started to question if in inflating the specs ever higher was still a trade off worth the price from a user standpoint as that level of power is largely unnecessary. A lot of people can't imagine that price point being a necessary expense if your current phone is usable. Small questions that have nagged at the industry are getting bigger these days.\n\nOn paper, Google has much lower specs in their phones, notably the Pixel 3 having less ram then the phones that came out roughly six months before it. After a decade of comparing phones by component prices it feels like an obvious rip off to people.\n\nIn what I can see, Google isn't thinking that way in their design ideology at all; in the Pixel line you're paying for experience and software. Google presumably reduces costs by using, for instance less ram or an older processor and makes up for it back end, with a stronger software experience. Love this or hate it, I can see both as it's effectively a fundamentally different approach that I'd argue could get communicated more clearly; paying for experience when the \"product\" isn't visible to the consumer in the same way makes customers distrustful because the number of companies opting for every method of squeezing cash out of the customer. *(See: every software like Microsoft office that moved to subscription models so you can't just buy it and be done for ten years)*\n\nAs a pretty casual user of a Pixel 3 that upgraded from an older phone, I don't notice any lack of performance or slow down, though admittedly I'm not a high end customer. Experience wise I've gotten the same experience I might have out of a phone with better specs. So for me, I agree that my experience is stellar and I *feel* like I've gotten my money's worth. But as far as it's physical components, it's not inaccurate to say that the phone is significantly \"cheaper\" then it's competitors. For me though, it's still an insane step up front my old phone!\n\nFor Google, the Pixel like is an implicit argument that the physical components are not or should not be why a phone is priced\/valued, rather, user end experience, largely supported by software is a better barometer. Who cares if it was more or less expensive to make if the user has an identical experience, and software can scale better across generations as an investment? *(This has the likely intentional side effect of each phone probably having a better profit margin)* \n\nIt's a novel argument and I get it, but it's one a lot of people reject as an excuse to pointlessly and\/or greedily price gouge. To be fair to that perspective, it can be easy to look at the phone and see where compromise was made to keep cost down that heavier users than I argue impeded some experiences and usability. In that contrasting view, if the phone cost less to make it should translate as costing less to buy. And to be fair, the Pixel 3 and 4 launched at much higher prices and then dropped off with better sale prices later.\n\nTl;Dr - The vitriol on either side of the argument is largely an example of an evolving discussion about why phones are priced and perceived rip offs due to different value sets\/ideologies in what makes a good phone.","871":"I also work in IT, I guess it matters to the point that you're a technofile and are more sensitive to technology changes and variations among products.\n\nBut yea, mostly the experience is great! I lovee my Pixel 2 XL. I guess its more of looking at the \"on paper\" specs :\/","872":"So as it turns out 5W is 5x faster than the airpods and 2.9x faster than the airpod pros.  Fanboy or not how about we do just a bit of research before calling a company out.  Better to actually criticize them on something real and meaningful.  Also... What kind of fanboy agrees with baseless accusations against a company they like? Lmao.","873":"I would love to hear them address this topic. There's no way they have a legitimate reason to do this.","874":"I just meant in general, they are usually behind the curve. However, specifically in terms of charging, I'll just be honest Idk what the consequences of an 11W charger could be in a package so tiny.","875":"In case you didn't get a chance to see the other comments, it's 5w because of physical and heating limitations, and 5w actually is far ahead of the competition like airpods. The article got it wrong and corrected it to infact call 5w \"overkill\" .","876":"Yea I guess.. also I think their prices are slightly under top tier premium\/flagship phones, for example so that might be why they're not all the way cutting edge. That just really sucks tho! Might as well release a few versions just like Apple does for different consumers.\n\nAs far as headphones, I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Buds.","877":"Hmm, I mean.. I wouldn't say they are trying to cover it up with software trickery when the results are in fact real and quite impressive. Even more so if the hardware specs WERE up to speed they'd blow everyone else out of the water!","878":"After using the sony earbuds I have determined that noise cancellation on daily driver buds is pointless for me and probably many others.  Noise cancelling is better at constant tones like an airplane than it is with sounds of walking down the street, riding in a bus, or riding a train.  The seal from the bud cancels way more noise than anything.  If you are someone who takes trips in airplanes semi frequently you are getting a pair of over the ear headphones with noise cancelling. That's just how it is.  Personally I will never make the trade off of noise cancelling in earbuds in their current state.  I would much rather the bud last 6 hours without being in the case vs 3 with noise cancelling on.","879":"Unfortunately, this seems to be the trend.","880":"To add to this, it's actually 2.5-5x as fast as the competition. Airpods case charges between 1w and 2w apparently","881":">airpods included, operate at a much lower capacity (sub 2W).  \n>  \n>For a wireless earphones, 5W is definitely way more than what is needed.\n\nAirpods charge at 5W and it takes 3.5 hours for them to fully charge.\n\n[Reviewers complain this is slow](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/3\/29\/18286012\/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features), so your \"definitely way more than needed\" seems to be a sentiment shared by no one else.","882":"thanks for the heads up, ordering one of these today.","883":"[deleted]","884":"4a production is currently *being shifted* to Vietnam from China.\n\nRead: That wasn't the first choice and the move is still happening.

Should have listened to reviewers!","892":"Oh god I got that after 2 weeks","893":"Wait what??","894":"Yup! Yeah I think they should be good. I actually tried their older truly wireless ones and while good, weren't worth the $99. I heard the new ones you got are much better though.","895":"I noticed the way it was mentioned in the article so I was curious as to what similar products were rated for because they made it sound as if they would wirelessly charge at 10W or something, but that seems like it would generate a lot of heat in such a small package considering how much phones can already heat up when wireless charging.\n\nIt's possible the Galaxy Buds charge faster through non Qi wireless charging, but I haven't been able to find any info on that.","896":"Straight from the article:  \n\n>Secondly, and more importantly, the WPC listing reveals the speed of charging allowed by the Pixel Buds. Many smartphones, including the Pixel 4, support wireless charging at about 11W. Meanwhile, the WPC reveals that the Pixel Buds can only receive a 5W wireless charge, similar to 2018\u2019s Pixel 3 when not on an official charger like the Pixel Stand.\n\n>Admittedly, 5W charging is a bit disappointing, but considering the wireless charging is mostly there to help you top off your battery, it\u2019s better than nothing.","897":"I wasn't really referring to ONLY this pixel buds charging thing. I was more referring to the trend of their hardware releases the past few years.\n\nTake a look at their Pixel phones. They come out in October\/November after most other competition has already released their phones. They never have future facing specs, its always the same shit that we've been seeing for the past year, with for example the Galaxy line, but slightly worse. \"Here's our brand new Pixel!\" but with slightly bigger bezels than everything else, a worse display, slightly smaller battery, a bit less RAM, half the storage capacity.. oh but hey, get it all for ONLY $999! The same price as a phone that's better in a majority of ways, at least in terms of hardware. Lets be real, the Pixel 4 XL wasn't a terrible phone, but its probably a $700 phone compared to the rest. Pixel 3 was the same. Thats been happening with Google for the past few years in different areas.\n\nSo that's more of what I'm referring to, not just this tiny charging report on unreleased buds. You can even look at the first gen Pixel buds, they were what like $160 bucks but no one that reviewed them thought they were worth it. They got outclassed by a bunch of other stuff.\n\nI have a Pixel 2XL and have loved it, but they haven't really wow'd me since then. Sometimes you can't deny that a company you like could just do some things better, or provide a little more value for the price since the last time you bought their products. What do you think?","898":"It looks like the original Pixel Buds have a 620mAh charging case. At 5W that's already charging at 1.6C (1C means charging the full battery in one hour, higher than that means faster than an hour). Charging at 11W would be over 3C, which is very bad for battery longevity.","899":"Perhaps cutting costs by not having something that I feel is quite unnecessary for such a small battery capacity.","900":"I would love for you to research the competition and see where they fall.  There is no way you would post this here if you did.","901":"Oh yeah for sure. It wasnt necessarily a complaint especially since I haven't owned an Apple product in like 8 or 9 years lol it's just a much needed thing for me to have. I have the bose q35 and those things last for almost a week and I love that","902":"They are though. They use those to cover up for the fact that they are cheaping out on hardware. And they have done it EVERY time going back to nexus. It would be fine if they didn't try to charge prices similar to apple and samsung, but at MRSP the phones are a rip off for what hardware they deliver.","903":"Except for the writer of the article, which has now changed to say that 5W is overkill\n\nOh, and Airpods don't get 5W, they get less then 2W","904":"Also think about a fidget cube for his Easter basket or just because. They're around $10 and super fun for people who need something to do with their hands.","905":"That's really weird, I hadn't even seen any of that news today.

I have the orange phone. But think I prefer some of the other colours in the buds.","907":"Same. I probably would've bought the pixel buds (and a pixel watch) if they had come out 6 months ago. Instead, Samsung got my money.\n\nThe only reason I even have a Pixel is the camera. Otherwise, Galaxy phones are better in nearly every way.","908":"To be fair I've been very happy with mine otherwise.\n\nIt does seem like a pretty big oversight (after all, you're **always** gonna fold them by that specific spot!), but I've tried to switch to other, \"truly wireless\" earphones and I always ended up coming back to the Pixel Buds.\n\nFor instance, I love how small and practical the Galaxy Buds case is, and it's of course nice to be able to use either of them independently. But sound quality is much worse than the Pixel Buds despite the isolation, battery on the case is 1\/4th of the Pixel Buds one, and they're terribly uncomfortable to wear for me. I got them for free and I really wanted to like them, but they ended up in a drawer :(","909":"Seems a bit stupid comparing a wireless earbud to a phone","910":"[deleted]","911":"TLDR at bottom\n\nMy original point was that we can appreciate when they are in fact ahead of the curve, like they are with charging on the pixel buds.  A ton of people dog piled in and went with the crappy mob mentally that we seem to have given up on Fighting now days.  We should celebrate when a company does something good not mislabel it as something bad, figure out we were wrong, then say \"yah well they do other crappy stuff so my point still stands\".  \n\nIn regard to your other points, yes, I have had hardware envy every once and a while.  I own a 3XL and when I saw the S20 pro drop I loved it.  Then reviews came out and brought me back to reality.  The software is hot garbage and it turns out it's not as friendly as a device as you might imagine due to that over the top hardware.  Such as using a massive sensor with a tiny (mobile phone) lense, the point and shoot ease goes away due to the plane of focus being so small due to the hardware choices they made.  This combined with lackluster software polish, like is always the case, made me loose all lust for the S20 pro.\n\nI am not a \"mobile gamer\" other than some tiny time wasters and honestly I don't know a single person that is.  I know they exist because there are phones targeted at them specifically.  Point being is specs don't sell me a phone. The overall experience does.  Google has me hooked.  This latest feature drop with easy access to the wallet, quick updates to the newest software all the time, ease of use, and a crazy good and fast camera are all I really want in a product.  Now would I like a bigger battery? Yeah probably.  Do I need a faster processors? Nope I have never experienced a slow down on this phone.\n\nReal quick story before I wrap this up.  I bought my pixel 3 and took it to work with me, day 1 people said \"that's cool be wait 3 months and it will lag like hell, the pixel 2 and pixel 1 did it, I'm sure your phone will to\" and here I am a year and a half later with zero issues.  It's a cool and easy thing to hate on them but no one does what I want in a phone better.  1+ caught my eye for a while but it's not the package I want, same with Samsung.  One more quick story.  Everyone shit on the notch on the 3xl before it launched, they often still do.  But whenever I give my phone to friends they say \"wait this is it? I could get used to this in a day\".  I did. Everyone could. People just like pitchforks too much.\n\nThis is not even mentioning the life of the device due to actually getting software updates.  \n\nTLDR: it's cool and easy to hate Google, most of it is totally unwarranted. Other companies making \"better hardware\" often fall flat because of software or mistakes that make the hardware inferior in terms of a simple daily driver. Praise a company when they do good. Criticize them when they do bad.","912":"Makes sense, but to be fair I meant about this trend of always behind behind the curve. That's the topic I wish they would address.","913":"Yes but for cost cutting to be worth it, the price needs to be lower. If you offer a product with cost cutting measures compared to the competition, and it's the same price, then it doesn't count","914":"Yeah, but fancy buzz words sell shit while boring stuff is left behind.","915":"I would love for you to be quiet and leave my nuts resting on your chin.","916":">Oh, and Airpods don't get 5W, they get less then 2W\n\nApple says they get 5W in the source I linked.","917":"That was a different reasoning (Trade War) and specifically said they don't know whether or not it will affect the Pixel 4. 4a wasn't even mentioned. It was more of a leisurely \"This might affect us at some point, and we'd rather not deal with it\".\n\n[*Cue recent panic due to coronavirus.*](https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Spotlight\/Coronavirus\/Google-Microsoft-shift-production-from-China-faster-due-to-virus)\n\nIncidentally, since everyone will be pressuring them to work faster and they may not have the expertise or equipment to make the stuff correctly in *any* time frame, I'd be worried about quality with anything suddenly made in Vietnam.","918":"I saw someone put it in a pretty good wording the other day;\n\nGet a Galaxy phone if you want a phone that'll be fast for a few months\n\nGet a Pixel phone if you want a phone that'll be fast for a few years","919":"Looks like they edited the article.","920":"That's quite a swing in opinion. Which I kinda respect. But do your research first.","921":"Yeah I get where you are coming from but I want to reiterate that I was not \"mislabeling\" something good as bad. I was adding my own thoughts to a comment about google being behind the curve in my own experiences. If it came off as ripping on these buds that wasn't my intention. \n\nAs far as the phone experience goes, yes I agree that Googles software is a much better experience and that's why I have a Pixel phone. Even though that's a personal opinion and not everyone might feel the same. However a majority (if not all) of what you are paying for in the cost of the phone is the hardware. So my point of it being a bad value against the competition still stands. Whether or not its useful to specifically you is not a valid argument.\nThe Galaxy S10 has better specs than the Pixel 4 in a majority of categories, but they charge the same price. Why does Google give 6gb of RAM when the norm is 8? Why 64gb storage and not 128? Why only 2 cameras when others get 3? a 10% smaller battery. No finger print reader. A consistently worse screen. There is no denying they cut corners and then still go and charge the same price as every other better phone. It feels like a rip off when Google COULD give you the hardware which that money can actually buy, as shown by other phones. Then their software on top of that would be even more phenomenal.\n\nRight now I have hardware jealousy over the S20... if Google would offer their version of a phone like that with Googles software, it would be amazing. However given the trend you cant help but expect the Pixel 5 to have less of everything. Less RAM, less storage, slightly lower battery, the screen to not be quite as nice, the bezels to not quite look as sharp, all for the same freaking price. That's just a bit of a bummer, even for a Google fan. You wait until the end of the year for a phone that just ends up being not as good *as it could be*.\n\nYou can say you don't need the highest specs and those cut corners work just fine, however why should you be charged the same price? Google could put better (or at least COMPARABLE) hardware out but they just choose not to. You can pay $999 for a phone with comparable specs to a $700 phone because you prefer it. but that doesn't make it a good value.","922":"That's likely due to Google focusing on software advancements rather than hardware, and when it comes to many software related advances, Google is pretty cutting edge. \n\nNot to be confused with UI advancements, where Google can be hit or miss on catching up (And perhaps there's a reason for that, idk).\n\nGoogle has some advanced hardware elsewhere, like their WiFi router has some advancements others on the market don't (unless you get to high end stuff which have ax and Google doesn't), Chromecast is\/was arguably hardware that was cutting edge, their Webpass service could count, and Pixel stand was cutting edge when it came out.\n\nSo I think Google can do it, but for phones they don't, for all we know it's because they have prototypes way early to allow software development for the features to link up well. But it does still suck they're always a bit behind, especially on RAM or storage, which doesn't have a timing issue.","923":"Well now that we know that no other charging case gets even close to 5W, I guess they addressed the topic!","924":"Maybe a post about them being ahead of the competition isn't the time to call them out for being behind the curve? Idk might just be me","925":"Cost cutting for them. If they can make a cheaper product but still charge the same price for it, then they win, because now they're getting more profit.","926":"facts","927":"You want me to suck your dick?  For sure.  Where and when?  But that's a sidebar to you being an absolute moron who can't admit when they are flat out wrong.  Check your bias.","928":"Wel the WPC register (the basis for this whole story) has the Airpods case [listed at 1.1W](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MwMjded.jpg)","929":"Agreed.","930":"Cool beans.","931":"Why not? If 90% of the time they are behind the curve..","932":"Nope. Just have my nuts rest on your chin.\n\nLOL? what bias? if anything I am biased *TOWARD* Google, you moron.\n\nLearn to take a joke and lighten up a lil.","933":"What was a joke? balls on the chin? hilarious, turely the pinnacle of comedy.  If you were bias towards google you would read up on what you are talking about and not get angry and talk down about them regarding a feature that is actually better than all of the competition.  You are CLEARLY using that as some weird shield.","934":"Wow that's ironic. \"can't admit when they are flat out wrong\". Hey genius, I'm literally a Google fanboy.\n\nAlso, thank you very much. I do think it was quite funny. Like, MYYYYY BAD?? you have no sense of humor. I take it you're not a fan of Key n' Peele, or else you'd understand the reference.","935":"Jesus Chris.  You made a shit \"joke\".  Does it make you feel better if I say...  OH DUDE! A TV SHOW REFERENCE THAT EVEN IF YOU WATCHED THE SHOW YOU MIGHT NOT GET BECAUSE IT WAS ONE SKIT!  THAT SOOOO FUNNY!  Does that help?  Idk what to say to you.  It wasn't funny.  For that matter if you are the guy with a \"sense of humor\" that consists of referencing primetime TV shows... I am glad I don't understand your humor.  BRO ITS LIKE THAT ONE TIME WITH CHARLIE IN ITS ALWAYS SUNNY WHERE HE HITS A RAT WITH A BAT! yeah.  Truly hilarious.\n\nBack to my actual point.  What kind of \"fanboy\" reads negative comments about a brand they fanboy over, doesn't refute them about of his fanboy mentally, doesn't research about it and come back with facts, but instead dog piles on the hate train and agrees with the other ill informed comments then argues with a guy who is trying to defend, in this instance, the brand he is a fanboy over?  Now THAT is a funny setup for a joke.  Some absolute moron crapping on a bean he absolutely \"loves\" and \"fanboys\" over all while incorrectly calling them out for something bad he thinks they have done but in reality they are beating the best best thing by 2.9X and he STILL claims he is a fanboy.  THATS FUNNY LMFAO.","936":"LOL!! I aint even reading that. You BIGGGGGG maaaaad.\n\nTake this F.","937":"lol then don't read it lol.  It's probably better for your ego if you don't lol","938":"Don't worry. The wahhmbulance is on its way to take care of your booboo's","939":"Another killer joke from George Carlin over here lmfao\nEDIT: its take this L first off lmao... seriously when did amy schumer get a Reddit?!","940":"Right after I placed my nuts on your chin. LMAO boom, roasted.\n\nI mean, look at this guy. Placing \"lol\" before AND after his sentence at an attempt to try and sound funny. Stfu nerd.","941":">I just have to hope for an update that will fix stuff\n\nIf you're within your return window, just return them.  Don't hope that an update will eventually fix your issues.","942":"I have the exact same sentiments as you. Avid google fan, bought the Pixelbook Go, Pixel 4a, and the Mint Pixel Buds 2 and they arrived at the same time last week. I watched and read dozens of reviews for all 3 and this is how they went:\n\nPixelbook Go -  Reviews: stellar product but a little bit overpriced. My experience: most I've paid for a Chromebook but one of the best-made laptops I've owned, only behind a MacBook Pro.\n\nPixel 4a - Reviews: Great for the price. My experience: Not perfect but by far the best experience for a phone I've had at this price.\n\nPixel Buds 2: Reviews: great, when they work. Have issues. My experience: Day 1,  not updated, connectivity issues, lack of bass. Day 2, updated, still has connectivity issues, has bass. Day 3, right bud stopped charging, reset the case, and now they refuse to pair. Returning for a refund.\n\nGoogle has a hardware problem. When the hardware is good, it's great. But when it has problems, they are catastrophic. Now I know not to buy a google product unless the reviews are flawless. I feel so dumb because I already own a pair of AirPods and bought the Pixel Buds cause I thought they'd be better with my 4a. Turns out, the product that actually works is the better one. Smh.","943":"I've experienced literally every one of these issues. \n\nA few weeks ago, I ran five miles listening to music in one ear.\n\nThere's so much to love about these headphones, but so much to fucking hate. Just like my toddler.","944":"I gave Google the benefit of the doubt and assumed people were bitching on the internet because people love bitching on the internet about Google hardware.  Mistake.  These things are awful. \n\nReplaced with Samsung Live Buds on Friday and it was like night and day.  No issues, exponentially better sound.","945":"Are you planning on returning them? I really love the pixel buds as well, but the 110 second cutouts were the last straw. You shouldn't keep them hoping for a fix","946":"Never, ever \"wait for an update to fix stuff.\"  Google has gotten deeply involved in this game where they break shit and you the user pays for it. Yesterday I tried to call my elderly mother due to an emergency and my phone wouldn't work. Look up on reddit and see that my issues have been reported with others on Android 11.  That is completely unacceptable, we shouldn't have to wait or spend an hour resetting or digging through settings to deal with fixing something that should *just work*, like a phone call.\n\nReturn your buds and never give another cent to Google.","947":"I must have gotten lucky. My buds are pretty much perfect. My only negative when I got them was the bass was a little lackluster. One of the updates added some bass and now they are pretty much perfect, really. And I use my buds 6 days a week at work and anywhere from 2 to 5 hours per day. \n\nWish you and others were having a better time with them.","948":"I've been eagerly waiting for these for years. Waited longer to get the mint for my spouse and the black for myself. Same issues straight out of the box. Returned them and the replacements are also doing the exact same thing straight out of the box. Returning them for a refund and buying myself a Samsung Note and some Samsung Bud Lives. I've been a militant MadeByGoogle fan and promoter for years. Every time I call their customer service they just encourage me to return them for a refund and told me no updates or fixes will be coming. Google can eat my whole ass.","949":"Like everything with Google it's a buggy, barely functioning beta product. I have the same issue with them. When they work, they are great but with these it's the exception rather than the norm. Same with Wear OS, Assistant has been broken for months (sorry something went wrong) or the pixel devices with bloating batteries and backs peeling off. It seems Google just can't get hardware right and yet every single time I think \"this time is the charm\" and it's another expensive disappointment.","950":"having similar issues and disabling the ear detection helped a bit but its not flawless yet, still giving it a bit more time to see if i should return them and give up","951":"I just returned mine and it's so disappointing.  The first couple days they worked fine, they cut out for a split second every minute or so but I could live with that.  I noticed a large discrepancy in discharging rates, the right one got down to about 12% while the left one was at about 48%.  Again, weird but not a huge deal and I could live with it.  \n\nThe next walk I took they just cut in and out constantly the entire time.  Did that again the next day, and again the next. Tried with different phones, same thing.  It seemed to be only when I was walking or away from home, weird.  Looked up solutions online, there didn't seem to be a fix other than to get jerked around by support and eventually return them.  I noticed I had one day left in my return window, so just returned them before it was too late.  For $180 earbuds I should not have to contact support in the first week and get jerked around by them.   I've been hearing about these issues for a while and clearly they are not even close to being fixed. \n\nIt's a shame though, I really liked them when they worked.  The assistant was nice, I liked the controls, the case and how they looked.  But yes, every time I got a notification I got a 10 minute lecture on how to read them out.  They did have some nice features but it's unfortunate they couldn't handle the most important and basic function, which was staying connected continuously.  Something that every pair of cheap bluetooth buds I had previously had no problem with.","952":"It's crazy because I've literally never had any of these issues and so many people have. I guess I finally hit the lottery.","953":"These kinds of constant issues with their hardware is what pushed me back to buying Apple products. It\u2019s just unacceptable to pay hundreds of dollars to basically beta test their products. I really wish they could get their shit together because there\u2019s so many things I miss about having a Pixel. It\u2019s really unfortunate.","954":"I returned mine. Loved the fit and features but the constant connectivity issues were a deal breaker for me.","955":"I just wish mine were more comfortable.  Cant seem to find the right size for the ears. Sometimes ill be fine with the small but they fall out.  And sometimes the medium ones itch.  The big ones are comfy but I feel like I dont get the full sound when they're in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the sitting directly into the earlobe style.","956":">     while I wait for Google to get their sh*t together\n\nHate to break it to you, but you will be waiting a long time for that one...","957":"I returned mine for the same issues and got the Jabra Elite 75t and I absolutely love them. No connection issues, they connect to two devices at once as soon as you get them out of the case (including Linux laptop, impressive!), physical buttons (much better than Pixel Buds touchpad, since I can use them even with gloves), more comfortable in my ears than Pixel Buds, better sound, and the option to listen to my surroundings, oh, and they are $30 cheaper at $150. I can't believe I even bought the Pixel Buds in the first place.","958":"This is why I didn't wait for Google's buds. The Sony's are much better even if they cost more.","959":"get the airpods pro and some app to manage it, voila","960":"Its sad so many people have problems with the pixel buds, while my only problem is the fit in the ear.","961":"I had all the same issues as you. The cutouts were the real killer for me. My music or podcasts cutting out several times a minute drove me absolutely batty. I ended up returning them and bought a pair of Galaxy Buds+, haven't had a single cutout. The samsungs are $50 cheaper and have been a vastly better experience.\n\nOnly downside with the samsungs is they definitely give you that \"plugged ear\" feeling. I really loved how the Buds 2 felt in my ears, but the cutouts for a $180 pair of headphones is unacceptable.","962":"Yeah, this is really unfortunate. I used to have the original Pixel Buds, and they worked perfectly for me. I loved them a lot! So I was really looking forward to these","963":"I've had mine since May. In the beginning they cut out a LOT when I was active, but that seems to have gone away. Overall I've been enjoying them, the fit is great for me, but I didn't love the battery life. At first it seemed they held a charge for a long time but lately they are losing charge at different rates. Another problem I've encountered is connectivity issues - first week I had them they would not pair with my pixelbook but that didn't last forever. Regarding the new update: They no longer auto connect to my pixel 3A. I really like the bass boost in the new update. But since the update, the touch controls are no longer working for me consistently. If you aren't satisfied with them then, take a lesson from me and realize that updates aren't going to fix the number of issues these have.","964":"Same shit here. I want to know of those who have no problems how many of them only use them indoors. It's usually only when I go outside and especially for a run that these happen. But I bought them as all purpose ear buds.","965":"EXACT same experience as you **AND** I had them replaced by Google with brand new ones just 3 days ago after doing a mail-in replacement.\n\nThe new ones work better around the house, but at the gym they are an unusable disaster. Cutting out constantly, I am CONSTANTLY getting duplicates of \"A nearby device is available to connect to!\" and every time I connect I get the \"Complete setup, click here!\" tutorial bullshit.\n\nI noticed if I am within eye-sight (less than 6 feet) From my Pixel 3a, they work fine... the moment I put the phone in my pocket and start moving around, all bets are off and the constant popping and dropping picks up again.","966":"Been using a pixel 4a after using an iPhone and airpods and have to say pixel is much buggier. Glad to know of this problem. For such expensive headphones this is a major disappointment.","967":"Omg. I have all of these problems. I was so excited for these. When they work, it's a beautiful experience... But that almost never happens. So disappointed.","968":"I have these same issues as well. I don't think I've ever seen the 1:50 bug. They just seem to have random cutouts, where I'll drop connection and only one ear bud will come back and I have to tap the nonworking one to get it going again and then it'll start all over again. I go through bouts of it working fine for 2-3 hours then I'll fight all day with it. No rhyme or reason. Happens on both PC and wifes iphone apart from my 3xl. I just sent them back last week. I really wanted it to work and will wait until a fix gets released.","969":"Im so glad I sent them back. Had connection issues. Ordered 30 $ Bluetooth \"airpods\" on Amazon and they are doing the job just fine.","970":"Just buy a pair of Galaxy buds. Three weeks in and I've had zero issues.","971":"On top of all that, I can't even put the phone in my pocket without losing connection. They are atrocious and I cannot for the life of me understand why the usual media outlets that love to bash Google hardware aren't talking about this.","972":"It's super said to see this as mine have been excellent. I use mine for Trail running and have them sync with my Fossil Carlyle and have had almost no issues.","973":"My comment is not intended to pile onto you, but mostly to address anyone reading these comments. Do **not** buy Google hardware products before they have proven themselves. I've had Google phones, tablets, etc. for like 8 years now and I promise, it's not worth the headache. \n\nThey're like Land Rover of the tech world. Yeah, their stuff is really freaking cool when it's working properly, but a lot your ownership will be wrapped up in trying to fix problems that should have been addressed before being manufactured.","974":"Not gonna lie, really glad I went with the Sony WF-1000XM3's instead of the Buds.","975":"I received my Orange buds.  The left one didn't work and had trouble charging. I contacted Google. After troubleshooting and nothing changed, support said that they would email me instructions for an exchange. In the meantime I read about all the problems that people were having.  I asked support to provide me with a Return Merchandise authorization and I returned them and got my refund. IMHO they will not be able to fix all those issues.","976":"After the Pixel 3XL I won't ever buy another Google product that has issues they promise to fix in a future update. They never fully fixed the performance issues with that phone.","977":"Finally got mine after waiting for the orange and ignoring all the bad reviews.\n\nWhat I have is vastly different battery drain, left will go down 5% but the right will drop 25%.  \n\nRepeated bluetooth drops only for seconds but will happen two or three times in an hour and half.\n\nUneven volume, sudden changes in volume and clarity.\n\nAnd of course none of the experimental features work by well like reducing volume when dogs are barking.\n\nI wouldn't recommend them for 180, although I guess the reason I waited for these was the equivalent Sony weren't water resistant.","978":"For what it's worth, I have a Pixel 4 XL (that has yet to receive the OTA Android 11 update) and I chose to go with the Amazon echo buds instead of the pixel buds.\n\nThey were approximately the same place, but the Amazon buds were powered by bose. Their noise canceling technology is incredible, and I've had zero issues with them to date. You can even interact with Alexa while you're listening to music.","979":"I'm having the same issues and it's so bothering considering I am enveloped in the Google ecosystem at this point so it's hard to deviate. The problems are not becoming of a giant tech conglomerate such as Alphabet and Google. I wish Google cared more about their customers.","980":"I took mine back. Waited a long time for them and what a disappointment they were. Connection issues constantly but the worst part is they actually hurt my ears to wear them.","981":"I was a Google fan girl, Google everything for years, until my P4. I think I lasted until the end of November with it (I got it the 22nd of October) I couldn't handle the battery anxiety anymore. \nI bought a Note 10+ and then Galaxy Buds+ after being extremely happy with the Note's performance and hardware. I paid $14 dollars more for the N10+ and I'm still a bit angry when I remember what I paid for that P4. \nI think I was so blind loving Google that I didn't realize 64gb storage and a 2800mah battery weren't acceptable anymore.","982":"I ended up returning mine. The constant disconnecting was too much for the premium price they are charging. It's too bad because without that problem, they would be really great.","983":"at 180, i think it's bs anyone have to put up with the issues it has. if u can return, get rid of it!\n\ni strongly suggest soundcore, [this aukey buds i bought recently](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B087WKLBGJ), 30$, just as good as airpods imo; good for the basics. samsung buds(+ if u care about mic). and lastly the airpods pro! it's 200 right now. i wouldnt buy it at 250. but 200 it's no brainer; best mic, good sound, good battery, great ANC, slim battery case), and now there's foam eartips available for the pros!","984":"I had the exact same buds, cut out constantly. I was outside of the return window, but was able to get one processed anyway. Never felt better to let something go.","985":"Keeping an eye here to see if any fixes before repurchase but doesn't seem the case.. I was \"lucky\" enough to buy two back to back facing defective pairing issues and immediately returned. Just got my refunds after 3 weeks finally.","986":"This is kind of discouraging to read others having the exact same issue. My wife has been asking for these for probably 7 months so I ordered them for her birthday and they worked properly for maybe 3 days. She\u2019s on a live chat with a rep now trying to troubleshoot the issue. She has such bad issues with the left ear bud not connecting that she has to factory reset every time she wants to use them and the rep is telling us to just try factory resetting them and it \u201cshould\u201d fix it. \n\nSuper frustrating that $180 ear buds have this much of an issue with connecting. And bummed that these might not work out and need returned, she\u2019s been so excited for them.","987":"So I'm an iPhone user...I left android after the Galaxy S7 and just bought a 4a as a secondary play phone (stadia, xcloud, and star photos). And wow...it seems fun at first but it has so many minor things that just ruin the experience. The largest failure is that autofill just plain isn't working...not to mention things like the search bar on the homescreen searching google only and not suggesting installed apps and results from the play store...\n\nThis covers my experience with everything in the Android ecosystem. It seems cool at first, but then the multitude of small issues ruin the whole experience.\n\nYour description of the Pixel buds fits so neatly into my view. They _seem_ cool but then the failure to reliably have the most basic functionality ruins the \"cool\" features like live translation.\n\n(Meanwhile my airpods always just work... though they're occasionally a little touchy when switching from mac to iphone since the mac doesn't want to let go of the bluetooth connection)","988":"I've been wanting these, but have been holding off because of all the issues everyone keeps writing about. They would be smart to have it fixed by the holidays. If they don't fix the issues be the holidays though, I will give up on the desire to get them. Ridiculous they haven't been fixed this long after release.","989":"I ordered my Buds on launch day and I'm beginning to think this is a hardware issue. They are basically unusable.","990":"I was considering the Pixel Buds. Went with the Plantronics Backbeat Fit 3200 and they've been great so far, after a few months.","991":"Get some Bose or like Jaybirds tbh, just not worth it","992":"Sorry you've had problems with them. They seem to vary by Buds, as I haven't had any major problems with them, fingers crossed, since I got them in May.","993":"Came here to say I was exactly you. I wanted them to work so bad, and I was not going to return them because I LOVE my google family and wanted these to be a part of it. I even had the mint too. One day tho I was listening to a podcast and couldn't even make out a word that was being said because the skipping was so bad. I got on a Google help chat, and the guy I was talking to said,\n\n \"I can walk you through all of the resets and things that might fix it, but I'll be honest it most likely won't.\" \n\nAnd I said, \n\n\"Can you at least tell me there is a fix coming? I want these to work so badly.\" \n\nAnd he said,\n\n\"There is not another update\/fix in the works. If they are not working your best bet is to return them.\" \n\nAnd that's when I returned them \ud83d\ude22 I think the best way to get pixel buds that actually work is to let Google know these suck and we are not keeping them.","994":"I'm happy with my $60 Anker ear buds","995":"Just wanted to say thanks for this post.

There's just too many good options out there for true wireless earbuds to deal with this level of connectivity issues on a \"premium\" priced product.","996":"Interestingly enough, my PixelBuds work perfectly when they are paired with my work MacBook or my Pixelbook, but not when paired with my Pixel2. I assume that the Bluetooth stack on my phone is somewhat broken.","997":"Did you return them to Google? I had a new pair within a week when I had an issue. It was quite painless.

My right bud doesn't charge half the time, and they constantly disconnect from my phone.","1003":"I don't get your last sentence, why have such blind brand loyalty if they aren't keeping up their end of that bargain? I won't leave the Android ecosystem, for now, but if another company is putting out good products why not give them a shot?

I've even had one ear go out when I touch my nose. i did this about 20 times in a row to confirm. The connection is just spotty. While riding my bike, it's definitely worse, i assume due to all the interference. \n\nBut about 60% of the time I double tap to fast forward to the next song (side note, what a terrible thing to have to do, to thump something inside of your ear), it will pause for a second and then continue playing the current song. Meanwhile it actually goes to the next song on my phone, but doesn't play it. If I hit it again, it will go to the next song but at the same timestamp as the song I was just on. This also means if I restart a song, it starts playing a different song. \n\nCombined with the fact that I have to actually tap on something close to my ear drum, this is a shitty experience. Honestly, I'm sure literally any other brand of ear buds would be better. But I havent tried them.

Mine aren't perfect but at least after the cut out I can't listen it them decently. I'm starting my RMA today so we'll see love the buds if those issue didn't persist.","1018":"I honestly got sick of trying to improve Googles products. It was fun at one point to root and work around issues but I grew tired of workarounds. Problems lasting through multiple hardware revisions (Bluetooth stack etc), Overpriced and under supported hardware and an overall lack of quality control pushed me to the other side. Apples support of older devices also allows for incredible resale value, something Google still hasn\u2019t figured out.

Loving the Galaxy Buds Live, too.","1021":"Same deal.  I returned mine literally the same day I received them as they were cutting out at the 1:50 mark consistently.  The latest update didn't help.  I just purchased the Galaxy Buds+ and can't wait for them to get in.  Better earbuds for a cheaper price, no brainer.","1022":"Nope, the problems are legit. Returned my pair hoping to buy in the future once they push a fix.\n\nOut of all the headphones I've owned my whole life, I'd rank them last.","1023":"Not OP but the 110 is why I returned mine.

Or does it actually cut out for exactly 110 seconds?","1025":"This is why I can not recommend the Pixel to anyone. An update fixes one problem but causes another, so frustrating.

I've had the buds since June and love them. I almost feel guilty when I see all the problems people are having with them.","1031":"Oh that's interesting I didn't think to disable ear detection, I'll give that a try...","1032":"I wonder if there are different revisions and the newer ones without issues.\n\nIn Europe they still only sell the white ones maybe they are still fixing hardware issues before releasing all the colours.\n\nI'd like to get these headphones just because they are open (which make the bass worse but the usage while you are moving, much better)","1033":"It works OK - but not super duper and you don't get the magic connectivity of the Apple+Apple pairing.

But in most cases, likely including with the Pixel buds 2, they aren't.\n\nMine are fine, they cut out for a second at most when I'm outside and my phone is in my pocket and I look left and right quickly while running. Absolutely worth it to avoid the plugged ear feeling.","1046":"I knew people were having issues but from looking around plenty of people were also saying that they were fixed with the update or that there were no problems.

People who don't have issues with their buds don't got out of their way to post about it, whereas people who do have issues are more likely to do so.\n\nYou're asking people to make a purchasing decision based on the comments of the people who are having issues. If that is the case, no one would ever buy anything.","1048":"No this has been going on since they came out and they just lie about an update that is supposedly going to fix it over and over.

I use both when I'm running or power walking and I also use one bud when I'm biking sometimes.

Glad your getting good use out of them!","1070":"I believe all of them as well, but, I just wish there was more positives out there.

I read about the issue I had with returns and how they were fixing it... from over two years ago.","1085":"Every product has an expected failure rate but Google's just seems to be unusually high compared to its competitors, and it also seems to vary from product to product. \n\nIt shouldn't be a complete turn-off, but just see what others say about the particular product before you buy. And run if they're any red flags.","1086":"That's fair. Where they lose me on the software side is their constant shuttering of products.

I'm not arguing Google's hardware isn't shit 9\/10 times, but you can find bad experiences with ANY product and use your reasoning. Hell I don't know how you could ever buy furniture or appliances, there's always reviews of people who got models with major issues.\n\nI think the advice of \"didn't you see people here say bad\" is weak, unless you have some data somewhere that this is a widespread issue. Lots of people rightly complaining on reddit doesn't mean anything if it's within the margin of expected \"defective units\".\n\nEvery business worth their salt has paperwork with a literal \"Accepted failure rate\". We don't know how many buds have sold, how many have issues, and what their true and accepted failure rate is.\n\nMy Pixel 3XL's camera buzzes when I set it down on a table and my power button gets stuck.

Heck, even their software lackluster at release for the better part of a decade now.\n\nThe reason why they're in this soup is because they are completely out of tune with the wants of their their consumer base. They lack intrinsic ability to even 'intake' this data and make information out of it into a feedback mechanism. It is the antithesis of a consumer-oriented business.","1098":"I'd argue it the pixel buds gen 1 didn't sell well because it wasn't a compelling product. Reviews had nothing to do with it. There were better products out there from a design and functionality perspective.\n\nSecondly Reddit isn't a reviews aggregator.

To believe that there are zero airpods or galaxybuds with similar issues is super asinine, not to promote bad products but of all Google's short comings I think garbage brand management has been by far the worst in history, of any American company. In a lot of tech sites, though not representive of ordinary people, but do shape perceptions, Google is regarded lower than Facebook which is a complete fail, worthy of CEO removal in my view.","1107":">there's no update coming that they know of \n\nExactly, they know literally nothing about the actual product development and are just speculating themselves.

Instead they are encouraging refunds and stating explicitly, as of right now, there is no fix date. I don't know why you want me to believe that developers might have a fix, and are just letting CS tell customers to get their money back, but that makes no sense. They either do not care, do not have any kind of timeline, or the developers are worthless and can't fix their mistakes. Either way an employee of Google said there's no fix and no timeline on a fix. Believe it or not yourself it might help some people make a decision on whether or not to return these worthless buds.","1123":"Yes. My understanding is Google hinted at this being an antenna issue.

Customer support agents at Google are much further removed from product development than you think. I'll leave it at that.","1125":"Thank you.

I \"liked\" the phone, definitely not love. I came from the Samsung Note series which I originally purchased because Google first got into the cell business then abruptly cancelled developing the pixel line, then later got back into it. Now they \"seem\" fully committed to it. A tech friend of mine had the 7pro so I bought it. I also added insurance to it through Assurant for $9.27\/mo. I've used this in the past to cover damage or loss. \n\nFor the first time in my life I lost my phone on a late flight coming home. So thinking I was covered I called Assurant or actually entered a claim online. This is when I found out the insurance does not cover loss like my insurance through Verizon had in the past. It only covers damage and from I've seen online that coverage is in question as well.\n\nI just disputed all of the charges from google. Sorry to hear about your experience. It stinks to be let down by these companies. If you follow their stock prices their behavior seems to fuel better performance which is bad for customers. I've dealt with  Microsoft, Apple and many other tech giants. In many ways they are all the same. Buying quality does make a difference and so far I have an HP laptop that is 10 years old and still works great (except for the disruptive Microsoft updates that deleted and renamed directories and cost tremendous amounts of my time.)! I also have an Apple iPAD that is 7\/8 years old and also works great. So there's hope.\n\nGood luck to you.","1142":"How is this nightmare with \"Pixel 8 Pro\" .

Took two months of calls\/emails where they supposedly were \"escalating it to a specialist\" and \"waiting on a response\" but not actually doing anything.

Don't think Google has the best technical support around. I would compare it to a bunch of people that don't know anything about technical support. They're like kindergarten kids. I thought most of the time I was talking to an AIl they did was to keep repeating my question over and over again. I had three questions. They could not answer one. I lost an app. A call recording app that I had  on my phone working perfectly. I also lost a sensor for my blood sugar  that was connected through Bluetooth on my phone.  Do not use a factory reset if you have any medical devices or apps that may not be restored on your phone.  It was very hard getting everything back.

The support is actually the worst. They sent me a broken watch, screen was messed up, and I got a return box for the watch. Sent it back and confirmed with support they received it. \n\nAt this time, the watch was paired with a new phone. I got the return box for my old phone for credit, but the phone kept getting pushed back. For 4-6 weeks it was back and forth trying to figure out where they lost my phone. They didn't give any compensation waiting for it while being constantly emailed about a time limit that I can send my old phone (the only one I had at the time) to them for credit. The new watch came, finally they had to re ship my phone, and I had everything. \n\nAnd then 2-3 months later I get a charge for the watch. That I sent back, and was confirmed with support that they received. It took a week for them to refund that money back and it looks like they do this constantly for return orders like mine. Luckily I was fortunate enough at the time to have that extra money in my account, but most people and usually myself, don't have hundreds of extra dollars for them to take or borrow our of people's account just because their systems are so shitty. It was back and forth with 4-5 different support saying it was a mistake, or it was on purpose and I was screwed, and jk again it'll be put back in my account once it gets accepted..and refuses to acknowledge or accept that support and the tracking number said it was delivered to their correct shipping address.\n\n\nLong story short..their support and their shipping systems is terrible and it honestly sucks.","1174":"I definitely am not letting it go. I am not going to be stuck paying $200 for an item I only took because it was free.

I had it with me, set-up and working, and paid for the device, and the preferred care.

Now, I understand these are headphones that plug into a 3.5mm jack but the amount of positive reviews on amazon speak for themselves.","1257":"Well for completely wireless buds, there's not much competition. But I agree with you.","1258":"Disagree. Afaik they lack a lot of functionally, simply because you didn't buy an Iphone, but you're still paying for those features, which you have no access to.

I've played around with my friends AirPods and I was quite impressed with the range and the fact that without the cord they feel a bit more free. I have a pair of Sony Nwz-ws613 now, but they are a bit bulky for everyday use. \n\nI do however workout quite a lot, both weight lifting and running, so sweat resistance is a must. I don't think the Airpods are officially sweat proof, but there are a lot of reports of this not being an issue. Not a lot of data on the Pixel Buds yet. \n\nJust wanted to know if there was something in the box or leaflet about sweat :)","1291":"I'm in the same boat trying to decide which ones to go with. I have a pixel 2 XL.","1292":"No idea why you're getting downvoted for saying this...","1293":"Well it depends on what features you need. I just wanted play\/pause which I get with the airpods. I wouldn't use Siri or Google Assistant anyway.","1294":"They literally don't lack any functionality other than quick pairing because apple doesn't write the software for Android.

","1297":"Well, I guess that I'll be happy upgrading from the X2s.\n\nDo the pairing features take a downgrade with non Google phones? Are you aware?","1298":"Fair enough. I just thought from your phrasing that you were implying the AirPods are supposed to go into your ear canals, and they definitely aren\u2019t. ","1299":"How well does that work exactly compared to what was shown in the demo on stage?","1300":"This is what I've heard too.\n\nIf you're looking for quality and Google Assistant, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II would probably be a better option. They are headphones (not earbuds) though.","1301":"Yup and Google hasn't made headphones before so expecting great sound quality from them is a fool's errand. ","1302":"They did completely rectify that mistake with the second version of the IconX, as it was without a doubt the biggest improvement to them.","1303":"Understandable. The battery life is pretty abysmal on these things. It's just hard swallowing $160 when I'll never own a Pixel and I got the IconX for $55 with a two year replacement plan","1304":"Probably the most important part of the buds.","1305":"You can view the buds battery on the phone.","1306":"So in your day you're telling me that you listen for >4 hours straight? Because otherwise you have time within your day to put your buds in the case where they recharge....","1307":"I mean charging the buds just means putting them in the case. They made it as hassle free as they could.","1308":"People used to say this about phones.","1309":"You obviously don't understand how small the batteries are inside a small earbud like this....you're just not going to get all day battery life, period. Hence when even apple decided to provide a charging case....","1310":"Honestly I have a pair of wired headphones for when I'm sitting down for long periods, and wireless headphones for when I'm cooking, commuting, or otherwise moving about. Works pretty great, although of course I'd rather have wireless 100% of the time.","1311":"I second this. I actually switched back to wired IEM and use BT when im walking or exercising.

","1313":"Well you can tap the right earbud when when you take it out in one motion and achieve the same result.\n\nDoesn't work with the left one though \ud83e\udd14","1314":"No proximity sensor.","1315":"Holy fuck, that's amazing.","1316":"It's not either of these, but I have the Erato Rio 3, and they're the best headphones I've ever used for running, and they're fantastic for weightlifting too. The range is pretty decent and the batteries last me about 6ish hours. Really love my pair. ","1317":"If you just wanted those features, then there are loads of options available, and most of those options would probably offer a much better sound for your money. The speaker driver and such in the Airpods are the same as the ones inside the earpods that you get for free, so the sound quality isn't awesome. You're paying for the features, not the sound, and you don't have access to some of them.\n\nEdit: a lot of Airpods fanboys in here. Nothing i said is factually wrong. Ask any audiophile if Airpods provides good sound quality for the money, they don't. They will all tell you that they're really bad for the price. ","1318":"Proximity sensor doesn't work and because android doesn't use their proprietary chip, you get less battery life as well.\n\nAlso some features may need an app? I want to say google now support and track switching. \n","1319":"Then I won't do that tonight!","1320":"Yes, these blow away the X2s. And I believe the pairing works with any Android phone on Oreo, but I'm probably wrong.","1321":"My understanding is that everything but live Google Translate works on non Pixel phones.","1322":"Oh okay. Yeah not entirely, but they definitely fit further into my ear when just putting them in normally.","1323":"Sorry, didn't mean to hit post. I'm at work right now. But it's exactly like what they demoed. I'll try to get a video.","1324":"Yeah, which is great. I'll have to try out the 2nd gen.","1325":"In my specific case since I switch between two pairs no, but if I had these google pixel buds as my daily drivers then yes, between public transport, nosy coworkers, and nosy neighbors. Other than some rare situation that work require my complete focus\/attention they'd be on and playing some sort of music\/youtube video\/other sort of streaming podcast or video for 5-6+ hours straight at the very least. ","1326":"This is the main draw for me. The fact that whenever you're not using it it's charging without cords (assuming the case is charged). That's amazing.","1327":"And charging them that often will make their battery life useless in two years or so.","1328":"I never stopped saying this","1329":"You know, it's okay to point out that for some folks the buds aren't really practical, even if they're technological marvels.  For some folks, four hour battery life doesn't make any sense for a pair of earphones.  Just like for folks who have had watches in the past that last three years on a battery, a smartwatch that lasts no more than a day isn't practical.\n\nTo each his\/her own, I say.","1330":"Which is another disadvantage compared to wired headphones. If wireless headphones are to be my only option besides a dongle I'm going to want headphones that will last close to a day.","1331":"Exactly why I don't want batteries. I want hydrogen fuel cells in each ear. I demand that as a bare minimum for blood money for the death of 3.5mm","1332":"[deleted]","1333":"> The speaker driver and such in the Airpods are the same as the ones inside the earpods that you get for free, so the sound quality isn't awesome\n\nI actually have both, and I can definitely tell you that the AirPods sound considerably better.","1334":"Can you name a few of these options? I've tried a bunch and they all have fatal flaws. Samsung's having terrible battery life, others that fit so poorly and are uncomfortable, etc.\n\nI've tried many of the cheap ones and they are garbage too.\n\nThe airpods just pop in, they work perfectly each time, and sound fine. Plus they don't block sound so I can actually walk around with them outside and not worry about getting hit by a car.\n\nCurious how you know the driver is the same as on the earpod. Apple doesn't release that info.","1335":"Awesome, thanks for the input! I'll try to find a confirmation :)","1336":"They don't go inside mine at all... Had them since December 2016","1337":"That's fine. Appreciate it, thank you.","1338":"You know if you have them in the case and the case has charged them to 100% they are not power cycling. Also the case likely has a circuit that is turning them off until the case is opened. Both factors limiting charge cycles and extending their battery life. ","1339":"It's funny how you have to make a point that day long battery life is a low bar for headphones.  Technology is supposed to blend into the background and make life easier.  Now it's turning life into a resource management adventure, where you gotta keep everything charged, yet find time in your day to actually enjoy the tech.","1340":"Gear IconX 2018 are my new favorite headphone","1341":"Personal anecdotes are okay, but when Apple has actually said that the audio components of the free earpods and expensive Airpods are essentially identical, then that takes presidence over personal anecdotes.\n\nObviously, they aren't going to sound identical, as Apple probably tuned the Airpods a little different, but that really doesn't change the fact that the audio components are the same quality as the ones you get for free with your smartphone. So it's going to be average sound quality, which is disappointing at that price point. ","1342":"> Curious how you know the driver is the same as on the earpod. Apple doesn't release that info.\nI disagree. It seems that Apple has released that info, as seen in the Verge's review, where they say the following:\n\"Apple claims the audio components are virtually the same between the two products (...)\"\nSo there you go, you're paying premium money for features you don't have access to, as the audio components clearly aren't high-grade.\n\nIt would be easier for you to just google stuff like \"Best wireless earphones\" and such, but i can name a few which i would personally much rather get.\n\n\n-  Samsung Gear IconX 2nd gen. \n\nThe 2nd gen has a MUCH improved battery life, and ontop of that these headphones are incredibly feature-packed and water resistant, and you can also use those features with your android smartphone. \nHere is a quote from Tom's guide's review regarding battery life.\n> The biggest problem we had with the original Gear IconX was its battery life, which clocked in at a paltry 90 minutes;. (...) Samsung sacrificed the heart rate sensor to extend the battery to 5 hours of Bluetooth streaming and 7 hours of local music playback.\n\n- jaybird X3\n\nThese are just a classic recommendation, as they're a good bang for your buck.\n\n- Beoplay E8 \n\nThese are exciting new earphones, which are created by the renowned Bang & Olufsen, so sound quality should be great. Furthermore, they're pretty featured packed. I have auditioned these myself, but for a brief moment, so not long enough to make a judgement, but they definitely did not sound bad\n\n- Bose SoundSport free wireless earbuds\n\nI would like to note that i heavily dislike the Airpods, as they are \"earbuds\" and by that i mean earphones that literally just hang in your ear. They don't offer any isolation at all, which i heavily dislike, as it means that every single noise will disrupt my music. This could lead to me turning up the volume, in order to actually hear my music properly over the outside noise, which could damage my hearing with time. Additionally, earbuds don't isolate the other way either, meaning other people will easily be able to hear your music, if you turn it a little bit up. Therefore earphones that actually have silicone\/foam tips that go into your ear and isolate is much better, imo. If you want to hear the outside tho, then i think that both the Gear IconX and the Beoplay E8 has a feature that allows the outside noise to come through the earphones.\n\nEdit: Apparently I'm downvoted for going above and beyond, when it comes to recommending alternatives. I suppose opinions that aren't pro-airpods really are damaging for people here. ","1343":"... I wasn't talking about power cycling at all, just daily charging since they only last a few hours.","1344":"Yeah. I love using wired headphones as the connection is flawless and power is no issue on that end. I have found what seem like good wireless headphones and will test out the purported battery life to see if it matches my use case. I generally won't mind too much if something will last at least a day because I aim to charge things every night.\n\nIf my 6P gives up and I have to go with a phone missing a jack for a stupid arbitrary reason then I should test out my options while I still have the option of both. I know about using a dongle but we really should be beyond that by now.\n\nWireless headphones do have some advantages but having another device reliant on a battery isn't ideal. What I really don't like is not having an easy choice between them. Google has been tending to remove more options recently for the sake of simplicity. Hangouts losing SMS integration, removing the headphone jack, that kind of thing.","1345":"We're looking for different things. I don't want sound isolation.\n\nI had the X3 and beoplay and they are still wired. Bose looks interesting I'll check them out.\n\nHave a nice weekend dude","1346":"If you don't want sound isolation, afaik the Beoplay E8 and Gear IconX 2nd gens also have modes to let in outside noise, so that could solve the issue.\n\nThe X3 and Beoplay E8 isn't wired. The Jaybird X3 earphones are connected to each other with a wire tho, but not a wire to the source. The Beoplay E8 is not wired at all tho, not even between the earphones, they're completely wireless.\n\nYou also said you had the Beoplay. Do you mean have alrdy owned the Beoplay E8? I would be pretty shocked if that's what you mean, as they were released very recently.\n\nIf you only accept earbuds tho, then Airpods is essentially the only option, as no other company is crazy enough to make expensive earbuds. ","1347":"Very nice comparison. \n\nIm an Android user since always (my first was the Galaxy Y) but I'm curious about how the iPhone work and feels. The thing is that in my country the iPhone pro max is double the price of the S10+, which is already expensive. \n\nThere's is no way I would spend 6 months of minimum wage in an cellphone. I'll probably stick with my S10e for some time.\n\nEdit: I live in Brazil, minimum wage here is 1045 BRL, which equals to 182 USD. Half of the country makes LESS than that. \n\niPhone Pro Max base price on apple website is 7599 BRL (1328 usd)","1348":"Nice write-up. \n\n\ud83d\udcaf on the file management. \n\nThat's the make or break it for me.

Fail. \n\nLike I want to go iPhone again because iPhones are quality hardware and software ruined by that..... imo.","1349":"This is very well written and rather informative, thank you.\n\nI do still prefer Android [for now], and you actually hit the nail on the head with exactly the two advantages that it has, that trump everything else for me:\n\n- file management. I don't have much to add to what you wrote - if someone uses their phone for more than just content consumption, iOS is in many cases going to be woefully inadequate.\n- customization\/home screen ui. I don't care so much about customization in itself - I used to be very into that, but I haven't actually changed my homescreen layout in several years. However, I think the iOS home UI is frankly stupid. I'm so incredibly used to having my apps at the bottom (and it's so much smarter to have it this way with bigger devices), that switching to iOS would be a pain. I'm also very married to *my* particular setup; a vertical launcher, to the icon set that I like, the kustom widget I made and so on. On Android, even while the stock launcher changes, I can always install a third-party one and reproduce my homescreen.\n\nI would very much *like* to have a smoother, better thought-out software experience. I would love to see app quality on Android increase, and I do think the state of the play store is pretty damn embarrassing - although not as much as the disconnect and the non-confortimity even among Google's own apps.   \nHowever, it's the two points above that trump that and all of the other points in favor of ios, for me personally.\n\nThere is a thrid one that you didn't really go into:    \nI used to be heavily into tinkering with my phone, flashing Roms, customization, automization and so on. I really don't anymore - at this point, I appreciate a simple experience that \"just works\" as it is. I have indeed become the kind of user that could be very happy with an iPhone.    \nHowever, I like knowing, *just in case*, that the option, that freedom to force my device to do *just what I want it to do*, is still there.    \nJust in case, I can always sideload an app. Just in case there's a specific functionality for which no app exists, I can always fall back to Tasker. Funnily enough, I just ran into this situation yesterday - after not having had to use Tasker for years, I had a use case for which there was no app that could do it, but Tasker works perfectly. It's the same with UI and UX customization and so on. I very rarely use it anymore, however, I very much appreciate that it's possible.","1350":"[deleted]","1351":"Planning to go back to apple just like you OP. \n\nBattery life and apps catering to iOS is the main draw for me.","1352":"There are two thins why I use an android over an iPhone and I\u2019ve had both over the years.\n\n1. Blokada - systemwide Adblock \n\n2. YouTube Vanced\n\nOther than that, I couldn\u2019t care less about that customize - tinker everything bs that you can do with android, there is nothing that\u2019s really appealing.

For me, I find the iOS notifications center to be difficult to use. The fact that android notification icons are persistent at the top of the screen, and that I can triage and respond to many notifications with a few swipes make me more productive on android. \n\nThat's one thing that's keeping me on android for my daily driver (as other have said, for now...) the only reason I'm considering a switch at the moment is because I have found all recent android phone launches to be disappointing in one way or another.","1355":"Android got much better multimedia apps, Tasker, and files. Probably the main reason I still use my android even though my sim is in my iPhone.\n\nI agree that apps are more polished on ios but android got apps for everything\/use case which Ios does not. \n\nI also find that everything on ios takes more time to do, like changing alarms, phone calling, sharing, changing settings and so on.","1356":"I've always considered an iPhone as a next potential device, but there's always been some features I'd miss that Android had that iPhone didn't.   This is the first generation I look at the iPhone and can't really list a ton that I care about personally daily.   Like legit the only I can think of that makes me uneasy is not having USB C, which would be an annoyance but not a dealbreaker, especially with wireless charging.\n\nWay back it used to be things like bigger screens, wireless charging, headphone jacks, SD card slots, lower price, nicer screen tech (high res, etc), but now it's like Android manufacturers have regressed on features and iPhone has advanced all while pricing has raised significantly on Android. \n\nI'm sure there's also the grass is greener factor and I'd miss Android things on iPhone but using my girlfriends iPhone for small bursts I'm just amazed at how nice it feels, and it's not as simple as animations being slower, everything is just 100% fluid constantly.   \n\nHonestly another irony is that what's keeping me with Android mostly is likely to be the fact that I'm well entrenched into Google's eco system.   I have a PC so I use the Messages app to text from the browser, no idea if any of that stuff works on iOS or if I'm stuck with iMessages.","1357":"Love this review. I am tired of Android for how many tiny hiccups I run across daily. This software is way too inconsistent in performance and it's really driving me towards iPhones.\n\nHowever the fact I can't control it like a PC really kills iPhones for me.\n\nI'm on Android for now but I'd be very easily convinced to switch.","1358":"I really hate android's little stutters, I bought a flagship soc damn it!

I don't really like any of the samsung shit, but what I do like is edge gestures. All of my navigation happens one handedly from the right edge. I mean everything. Then on top of that, I use an app called edge gestures to change media volume from left side of screen. I just can't give this up for the cumbersome bottom navigation. I don't want to reach stuff with my thumb.\n\nBut that's not all, I just realized you can't choose default apps on iOS. I can't live without google apps. I would throw my phone on the wall if it opened safari or apple maps when I hit a link. I'm a senior web developer and use chrome for everything. I need those passwords and sync. Who the hell uses safari? My dev friends would laugh at me, JK.\n\nI also don't fancy the notch or the huge edge bezels of the 11 pro. Unlike many here, I really like the edges on samsung, mainly because I rely on he aforementioned edge gestures. I think people generally don't realize how good edge gesture based navigation on these screens is, because no OEM does it out of the box to the length I do. \n\nI really wanted to change as money is not an issue and I already use airpods pro.

The OS is slow (animation wise) with everything needing a swoosh or a shrinking and the lack of a back button at the bottom of the phone just annoys me.\n\nAnd then there's iTunes. Why Apple insists on using it for data transfer and backing up is beyond me. It's slow, antiquated and bit really fit for purpose. I much prefer the Android way of just dragging and dropping stuff when your phone is plugged into a PC.\n\nIf Apple could get over themselves and allow a bit more customisation in their UI (more than four icons in the Dock) and allow a direct transfer system when the phone is plugged in, they may just convince a few more people to move over.","1366":"Wonderful write-up. I am an ex-iPhone 'heavy user' (iPhone 3Gs, iPhone 5, iPhone 6s plus) that switched to Android 2 (Samsung Note8, Samsung Note9) years ago.\n\nI come from a slightly different user experience from yours - privacy. I have been doing a lot of research into data\/online privacy these days, and I was very close to going back to iOS again to have a Google-free phone that is free from the spying eyes of Google. I really like Apple's stance on privacy, marketing or not, and although I much prefer the freedom of Android, I was willing to give that up for a phone that is Google-free.\n\nHowever, I flashed Lineage OS 17.1 on my phone, and now my phone is near perfect. It's almost completely Google-free, and for what little Google-apps I have, I can freeze them in a separate partition that has no access to my personal data, using an app called Shelter. I also have access to FOSS apps that are transparent with no under-the-hood trackers, which is simply not possible in iOS.\n\nI do miss the software updates and the smooth 'it just works' user experience of iOS, but that has mostly been solved with Lineage OS. \n\nHaving a de-bloated, Google-free phone with FOSS software is wonderful!\n\nI hope you enjoy your 11 Pro.","1367":"This is probably the most accurate description of Android vs iOS. Every point in this is correct and ultimately it comes to what you want.  For example someone who is used to sideloading apps, using modded files, uses torrent a lot. Android is probably the way. But someone who streams stuff, uses mainly free apps doesnt give a shit about customization, iOS is much better in this case.","1368":"Man you should make YouTube videos!","1369":"I went from an iPhone to Android and can agree with some of your points.  However, iOS just seem like it\u2019s not as seamless as it once was.  Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019ve relaxed the walled garden a bit.  The beauty of Apple is the synergy of its ecosystem and how well it\u2019s devices work with each other.  But those prices \ud83d\ude2b","1370":"> **File Management**\n\n> S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.\n\nShit like this is exactly the reason I can't switch to iOS, no matter how much nicer other aspects of the experience are.  It's sad really; I'd love to have an 11 Pro and an Apple Watch...but I can't go from having a *small computer* in my pocket to a locked down phone running an OS that is just a glorified app launcher.","1371":"On iOS you can copy any files you want onto the device, you just need to get an app first. Annoying, but possible.","1372":">The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly s\n\nI made the move from Note 10+ to 11 Pro Max, I disagree with this completely. I cannot understand this thought of \"iOS is simple and just works\". It's a mess, settings are buried in weird places, menus are a nightmare and I have regular hangups with Apps, volume turning to silent, keyboard closing randomly (not to mention the terrible auto correct of said keyboard). Don't get me started on the worst cell phone reception (both wifi and cellular) I've ever experienced on a phone.\n\nAside from that, the 11 Pro Max is awesome, camera and battery both amazing, and God how I missed a flat screen. I don't think I could ever go back to a curved display anymore.","1373":"It's kinda annoying now that I know stock apps has got apps, be it manufacturer ads or something else, everyother pre installed app should be with no ads like what I would expect a calculator app to be","1374":"iPhones have had better touch input from the very first generation. It's a technical limitation of Android and always makes it feel a step behind. Hopefully it's resolved with Fuscia.","1375":"It's funny how when the s10 came out everybody was all excited to switch to the s10 cause of all the features and the price difference and they were like \"oh yeah I would sacrifice the smoothness for a couple hundred bucks and some more features\" and now it's like \"wait it's not as smooth!?!?!\" Atleast that's the trend I'm seeing in alot of the media posts. Overall a good comparison though. If I was in your country there is a 100 percent chance I would be with a pixel or a oneplus because dang the exynos sucks. Maybe missed a few of the highlights of Android but that's likely a recency bias coming off using the iPhone. Well done sir, coming from another (future) engineer (I graduate in 2 eeeks) who also loves to talk tech.","1376":"This was super helpful, thanks. I'm considering this move whenever the new iPhone is announced. I use the active watch 2, the buds+, and a s10+. From your post you use at least the phone and buds together , so how did you find leaving the Samsung ecosystem? Also, what was the actual transition like? Not so much getting used to Apple, but the actual move, like moving  all your photos accross, moving all your google fit \/ a health information out, things like that?","1377":"I actually just ordered my very first iPhone today after I broke the cameras on my Galaxy S10e. I am really curious how I will feel about the phone because I know there are some things with iOS that I really don't like, but at the same time, I have gotten a little tired of Android lately. There are too much stuttering and glitches. I am also tired of the way Google is running things with their services and platforms.","1378":"Very nicely said, though I prefer the best of both worlds which is having a jailbroken iPhone. I actually just installed a tweak called activator which allows me to go back with swiping the right edge and there\u2019s so much more I can do that it\u2019s mind boggling. There\u2019s literally endless possibilities, it feels like I\u2019m using android with a MUCH more fluid OS it\u2019s really a beautiful thing. Home screen widgets, transferring files, hundreds of different icon themes w\/ changing grid\/layout and icons size. You can even set an mp4 as your lock screen and home screen. All this has actually made me use my iPhone XR as my daily instead of my s10+","1379":"Very good write up. Thanks. I have to say most things about Android (file management, customization) is better than iOS however there\u2019s mainly just 1 thing that keeps me from converting to android - it\u2019s the OS - the main thing. It\u2019s incomparable to the fluid iOS.","1380":"So I can't freely drag and drop videos and pictures from my pc to an iPhone and vice versa?  Can I at least use Google photos to back up pics and vids?  How about downloading pics from reddit with the iPhone?","1381":"Bro, you always preffered the iphone over android. You just didn't know it, because you are realizing that you like simplicity and fluidity (which is not bad at all. The review overall feels inclined towards one side, withouth and objective view. But it doesnt matter, you found a device that fits your preferences and that's ok. Good review!","1382":"I live in Asia so the difference in processors is a big turn off for me with regards to Samsung. The exynos feels like a generation behind but Sammy is still charging us the same price as the Snapdragon.","1383":"Hello, really interesting to read, you said exactly what I want to say and I used same your phones exactly, but personally I liked the android experience more than iOS (I might switch soon not sure)\n\nBut I've one thing to say, I don't have any single ads in Samsung apps (only weather app) maybe because at the beginning I didn't select to agree with ads, and I turned off all customization service, or maybe as you said it's regional.\n\n\nI just want to say thank you, I'll follow your blog posts and would like to discuss more if you are interested.","1384":"For me has been all the opposite, I find way more fluid and smooth my Pixel 3 in front of my iPhone 8 (I've it since 2017 and still rocking it as secondary phone), and the main reason to go back to Android wasn't just that (performance, because it's blazing fast!), I had to go back to Android due to productivity and connectivity.\n\nThe first reason to move was the absolutely AWFUL photo management on iOS, it's a completely mess, everything is everywhere, and photos are spread all around different folders, I had problem losing the date of the videos that I took with my iPhone when transferring them to my computer, that was really annoying because I needed the date and hour from them... I had problem with edited photos (photos with wrong date), a mix of folders and photos from camera, WhatsApp, websites, Instagram, Facebook... And those virtual albums are just useful in the phone, then when time to transfer photos come they are useless... The iCloud storage it's a joke also.\nCamera quality goes on preference, I prefer the quality in my Pixel 3, but on videos I guess the iPhone does a wonderful job, sadly that problem with transference (maybe a MacBook is needed for perfect result, not my case)\n\nOther reason was productivity... I've Instagram and some photo network app and notifications are always divided by group even if they come from the same app, for example, 10 notifications from Instagram are together and then I have 10 more in another notification...\nSetting and control panel are not that intuitive and easy, the reason because I got my iPhone was \"it's way easier to use\" and that's far from the reality... Setting for an app are in the app itself and in the settings area too... That not fast and not intuitive... Some options like auto brightness are deep down phone settings and that option should be on screen setting instead of accessibility... If you do a tour around settings you will find that is not easy or intuitive at all.\n\nPersonalization is something that is very limited on iOS, not honestly that is not something that makes you change the OS, I had a very good experience despise the limited way to organize my iPhone, and stock works just fine, I guess I was ready since I got my first Pixel phone, I learned to enjoy what comes from scratch and honestly I never needed to change my launcher, I was used to stock when I got my iPhone, and with almost 4 years using the iOS launcher, when I got my Pixel 3 I was really used and pleased with stock launcher, in fact, Pixel stock launcher it's really really nice, neither Nova launcher made my leave it.\n\nThe final point (I've more but I'll end here, I wrote too much) was connectivity; even when iOS has some great app for multimedia editing, I missed the connectivity that Android allows me, and one was the NFC, I use public transport and Android made my life easier, I can charge any public transport card from my phone with just three taps, no longer need to go to the station and charge my card in the classic way.\nTransferring photos to my computer is always easy and Google unlimited photo storage makes things even easier, I basically have access to all my old photos and they don't take space in the cloud and that's amazing!, Photo memories from Google are something really cool that photographer like me love a lot (well, we have that in iOS too now, but not work as expected)\n\nWith all this I don't want to say iOS is bad, on my experience, isn't bad at all, in fact is great, it have details like Android but it's still a great OS; at the end it comes to personal preference, I guess if you have other Apple devices maybe the experience becomes even better.\n \nI'll keep using my iPhone as secondary device, and I've intention to upgrade it, not really sure because they are hell expensive here in my country, even a old iPhone 6 is expensive, try to imagine the 11 Pro.\n\nMy recommendation is just try both system and see witch one fills you more; being a tech guy and a experimented photographer that need the best of both worlds that's the recommendation that I can give to everyone; don't allow fanatics or brands make you blind, and you will see that the competition it's really interesting.","1385":"Wow a good post on this sub, really surprising, I got the XS Max and with iOS 14 coming soon (September) A whole lot of your cons for the iPhone's software are about to be completely solved and I personally cannot wait. I will most likely upgrade to the 12 if it is that big of an upgrade, I know the 11 pro was even worth it for the battery and camera but decided to wait because I felt as if the 12 would be HUGE, so here's to hoping it is and I upgrade","1386":"What I really miss on Android is file-sharing capability like AirDrop. I had an iPhone for a couple of days and the way sending files worked between that phone and my Macbook was just\u2026 wow. \n\nAd payment) Have you tried Google Pay on that S10+? I use it pretty often on my S10e and it works flawlessly.","1387":"One big thing holding me back from switching to an iPhone is the notifications menu. Do you ever notice that you tend to let things slip up more often when you use the iPhone? The default notification menu behaviors absolutely blow my mind.\n\nFor example, if you unlock your phone your notifications are off in this separate menu that you have to manually look to see.","1388":"I always think the \"juicy-ness\" and smoothness of iOS puts Android to shame. What's the point of having the high end software in a flagship when you can easily make it stutter, lag, have shitty animations...\n\nBut is the iPhone as fast to navigate through as an Android 10 phone? Cause they didn't used to be, with no dedicated Back button.\n\nBesides not being able to access the phone's files like a flash drive, are there other Android specific software features that are noticeably missing on the iPhone that _lessen_ the experience of the iPhone?","1389":"I recently test drove an iphone 11 pro (first iphone) for 3 months (had a p30 pro). My observations are as follows.\n\nApple maps in my area is actually better in many ways than Google maps.\n\nCarplay is superior to Android auto.\n\nPerformance feels identical between the iphone and the p30 pro I had.\n\nThe iphone had many bugs in ios and that was a big surprise to me.\n\nThe iphone 11 pro primary camera is great, the telephoto and wide angle are of much less quality and I felt like they were almost second thoughts by apple.\n\nOne thing I could never get over is just how small the touch area is for buttons and links. There is no buffer. You need to hit the icon exactly or it won't register. This caused me the most frustration. I would consistently miss the back button in imessages and it would scroll up the conversation. Being constricted to safari is also not great. Third party apps are way worse than on android. They are usually not free and even then filled with full page ads. I moved on to a s20 plus because the huawei p30 pro stopped supporting volte in my area and I was dropping calls. Both the iphone and android function very similar today. I prefer Android though. I don't feel as though the 11 pro is worth the price they are charging.","1390":"I moved from note 10+ to iphone 11 pro and I agree with most of your points. I upgraded from s10e to note 10+ for full dex experience when note 10+ came out, but it turned out that it is not prime time yet, maybe I will go back to try it after a few more years. Iphone 11 pro has better battery life and overall, the app quality is better there.","1391":"You mention 1440p on Netflix on the S10.. You can't get it on Exynos. Only Limited to 1080p on all Exynos phones.\n\nedit : :LOL! Why was that downvoted? Y'all are weird!","1392":"I don't agree with the smoothness comparison. I mean of course you're comparing Samsung devices specifically but you cannot then generalise for Android devices as a whole. In my experience there has been no perceptible difference in performance of smoothness since even the Nexus 4. Every year since then the gap became smaller and smaller until at some point I felt as though the Android devices I used actually felt better overall, thanks to 'early' adoption of high refresh rate and high touch sampling rate tech. \n\nThe idea that iphones never lag ever is also absolutely an exaggeration and untrue. Your comparison should stay focused on the Samsung devices you used and not generalise for all Android devices.\n\nI urge you to at least try the OnePlus line before making a sweeping statement as you did.","1393":"So you haven't had any flagship Android Snapdragon phones except the G4?","1394":"How long have you had it for? Do you think the SE would be worthwhile considering? Or do you think bezels are a nono in modern tech?","1395":"For an Android subreddit everyone sure has Apple's cock down their throats. \n\nI'm using both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S9 and there is no difference. iPhones aren't magical and never have slowdown, it happens more than enough for me to notice. It's also super nice to be able to just download an emulator or ebook reader and transfer my files straight to my Android and use them.","1396":"I'm using the S10 and iPhone 11 Pro and I concur with your review.","1397":"[deleted]","1398":"How did you set up the bixby key like that?","1399":"Good comparison and I can see where you are coming from but I am an Android fan for years now so I don't think I can switch over again. Also I have a razer phone 2 rn and the front facing speakers are too good.","1400":"I much prefer iOS but one area where iOS is simply unusable is hotspot.. I just tried using hotspot as wired internet replacement for my parents and the iPhone I tried to use failed miserably. Apparently, there is no way to keep an iPhone hotspot connected when your client iDevices are asleep. They stay connected using regular wifi (and that includes a hotspot from an Android phone) but will disconnect from the internet if you are using an iOS device as your hotspot. So things like phone calls over WiFi, messages, etc. will not come until you wake up the iDevice. I had to switch their service (easier said than done with Sprint) to my ancient LG G2 with a bad digitizer and that works perfectly as a hotspot. I think this is some sort of battery management on iOS that disconnects internet if you are using an iOS hotspot.","1401":"Mate, I haven't used Samsung pay but I use Google pay on my note 10+ and I don't have to unlock or swipe or whatever you're on about. The screen just has to be on.\n\n\nWhat annoys me though is that just sometimes it asks me to fingerprint and I don't know why.","1402":"I jumped ship to Android last year with the S10e (Exynos), and I love everything about this phone. Although I have to admit that I'm biased towards Android because I made a huge leap coming from a greatly outdated 6-year-old phone in the iPhone 5S.\n\nNext phone I'll be getting is the newest iPhone, 3 or 4 years from now, to see how much of an \"upgrade\" I'll be getting, also because I'm broke lol","1403":"I'm actually also considering switching from Android phones to IPhones for the first time ever. If nothing promising is coming out from the Next Samsung and Pixel lineup up, I will switch to iPhone 11 pro or IPhone 12. I feel Samsung flopped to much with their S20 lines and Pixels still can't move up to High end\/premium quality and experience","1404":"I agree with your review. Only thing that keeps me away from iOS is the file management and DeX. I do not have a PC and my laptop is broken so I mostly use my phone as a replacement. If iOS can implement a desktop mode then I'll probably switch after using Android for more than 8 years.","1405":"If iOS would just continue deeper File integration with PC \/ Mac transfer along with additional UI customization I would be all over it.\n\nIssue with iOS for me is that I can't make it really 'mine', with Android I can tweak things like how icons appear and that already adds a whole layer of personalization.\n\nNutshell, basically just a very few things holding me back, oh and I want to mention how the Apple Watch is MILES ahead of even the best Google Wear \/ Tizen smart watches.","1406":"Good write up. I could never permanently go to iOS for my main phone. I currently use a Galaxy S10 for my personal device and an iPhone Xs for my work phone. So I've been using both concurrently for a while now. I don't hate iOS as much as I used to, but I still only use the phone when I have to.\n\nFor me file management (both on the phone and when connected to a PC), lack of default app options, the notification center, widgets in general, and a few other smaller things prevent me from making that switch. There are too many little annoyances that would bug me if the iPhone was my only phone.\n\nI do appreciate what Apple is doing. Not knocking the hardware or the OS in general. Just not how I want my device to work. I do disagree about fluidity though. Maybe out of the box, but Android's developer settings let you change animation speeds across the whole OS. The first thing I do whenever I get a new Android phone is go in there and change the animation speed to 1.5x normal.","1407":"The battery life is pretty amazing on my S10e. I'm not playing games and watching live streaming all day, but I can't say it's sub par","1408":"Amazing review, and I'm exactly in the same situation you were: I own an S10+ and I'm very interested in changing to iPhone, for many of the reasons you mentioned but also because the Apple Watch is years ahead of any other smartwatch.\n\nThe only thing that's stopping me right now is the iPhone's price: the 11 pro is approaching the 6 month mark, and it kills me that I either 1) need to pay full price, same as the exact day it launched or 2) need to wait another 6 months to get the newer iPhone....\n\nI'm a very impatient fella but I'm thinking about waiting just because I'd possibly have a chance at getting the newer iPhone and the Apple Watch series 6...","1409":"Really great comparison and makes me rethink if I should switch as most of those complaints about Samsung phones are on point. I should not have intrusive ads on stock apps. Also the small stuff like proximity sensor and haptic feedback was true. Although I have a s20+ and it has fixed a lot of those small issues. Still the ads in stock apps is annoying.","1410":"You can change the color mode on the S10 (and other phones) to be less saturated","1411":"Thank you for your  time and effort in writting this, it was very good.\n\nAnd its always nice to see someone address the haptic feedback on a phone, I feel like its just so underrated when actually, it makes interacting with the phone so much better.","1412":"Great review. Now that I\u2019ve used both OS\u2019s extensively I can\u2019t use just one. I have an iPhone 11 and S10+ ceramic. Probably the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned. I also have a S20 that I use just for media. The screen is just to small but the refresh rate is addicting.","1413":"I know this is probably unpopular opinion here, but pixels are the only Android phones I've found to be as consistently smooth as iPhones.","1414":"who ended up sticking with samsung anyway?","1415":"you should cross post it to apple\/iphone\/samsunggalaxy subreddits too.\n\nGreat write up, cheers","1416":"Your complaints about the exynos chip should be rendered irrelevant by the next gen phones, samsung has canned their custom core team and is just going with the arm designed ones so hopefully that means from the note 20 onwards the exynos chips are far more competitive.\n\nIf they keep building on their own fabs they'll still be behind, but it should be way less so then it is now.\n\nThe android market just sucks here in Aus right now. You've only really got either samsung or google to chose from, and they're both underwhelming for the prices charged.","1417":"I really dislike people who change phones and say \"my god! Its seamlessly perfect performance no hiccups no nothing!\", no shit, It's a brand new phone on an OS you're not familiar with. Every single android upgrade ive done has been that way. You'll start to notice things later, as well as iOS using misdirection with animations to distract you from loading times.","1418":"Re: payments \n\nI use Android pay... Samsung pay is not available here. It's just tied to your phones unlock.","1419":"For iOS drag&drop you have so many Mac apps or Windows programs. For music, videos, ringtones, etc I use Waltr2. Never had a problem. Works like a charm.","1420":"OnePlus 4 life","1421":"Agreed with you on the horrible battery life of the exynos models.

Apps feel more polished still, thats my biggest complaint for years on android. \n\nI love androids custom roms, widgets and customizations but as I got older I stop caring about it and just wanted my phone to just run smoothly without hiccups and that\u2019s where iOS shines. I still enjoy to tinker with my note 9 on Samsung dex and miss a few things on android. IOS wall garden still annoys me but at the end of the day right now I\u2019d grab my iPhone.","1423":"iPhones are boring to use unless jailbroken","1424":"Nice review. Can you plug in the iPhone to your PC and copy paste a video file over to watch? No? iPhone can suck eggs until that happens.","1425":"Great writeup. I've been looking for a new phone, as my 5T is getting less and less SoT lately. And after the prices of the op8, I looked around and ended up thinking an iPhone might not be so bad.\n\nThey have great cameras, they get good to great battery life and they get updated much more than Android phones.\n\nThe only issue is apps. I use some apps that let me customize things that I don't think will be available on ios. And that breaks my current workflow.","1426":"helth","1427":"Solid comparison! I'm on an S10+ and the 2 major things holding me back from an iPhone 11 Pro Max are the price and file management. \n\nI have tons of files on my phone and it would just suck if I had to upload everything to a cloud service first to then download them onto my phone and organize each file there. \nPricing is also a little insane. I got my S10+ for 700\u20ac 5 months after launch (999\u20ac MSRP). For a 11 Pro Max I'd have to drop 1400\u20ac so pretty much double. As a student I can't reasonably spend that much on a phone, even if the iPhone might last me a little longer, especially with an official battery replacement couple years down the line and the great software updates on iOS.\n\nThe regular 11 might be a good compromise for someone like me but I don't think I could go back to a lower resolution LCD after my S10+. Also at 800\u20ac it's still more expensive than the Samsung.\n\nOverall I still think I made a good choice with the S10. GPay, file management and pricing are the factors locking me into place.\n\nEDIT: Why were you using Samsung Pay on your S10 when GPay is the superior App? :D","1428":"[removed]","1429":"I'm a Samsung fanboy and I can agree with basically everything OP has said here. \nBeing a tech enthusiast I just hope that Apple's strongs now impulse other brands to be better and on the same level in the future.\n\nGreat review\/comparison btw.

That is if it ticks as many boxes as my compact S10e.

As an android user used to 0.5x animation speed or faster, every iphone I use feel glacially slow due to the uninteruptable animations. Waiting over half a second to go to the next screen is a big fail for me, and makes me frustrated to no end. I'd rather have an actual fast interface with the odd hitch here and there instead of a smooth and slow interface. And yes, I've tried \"reduced motion\" settings in IOS, and it didn't do much.","1443":"I have a hard time believing anyone actually prefers any of the iOS Reddit apps to rif on Android. That's been the worst thing about switching.\n\nThat and not having long press on keyboards for punctuation.","1444":"I don't see how anyone can switch from one ecosystem to the other. Do people not buy apps? I have spent so much on apps over the years on Android that I just couldn't switch without losing a lot of money.","1445":"Wait..the iPhone has a 'hands down' better shot during night time shots? Hmm. My experience hasn't been as such.","1446":"I think the reason why IOS is so stable is coz it doesn't change, and Apple has perfected it. Everytime a major update hits IOS, its so buggy but they'll keep fixing it the whole year until another one and its always just a few changes","1447":"[deleted]","1448":"Somebody call this guy a traitor right now!!!","1449":"Did you miss Dex ?","1450":"Yeah the ridiculously small RAM on the iPhone kills it for me. I like having all my apps in memory.","1451":"I understand the OP's points but I don't agree. \nTo me, an iPhone is best for the ppl who desire as little interaction with the device as possible....but there is a catch to that...i.e. You NEED to pay through your nose to buy the other components of Apple's ecosystem .... probably a MacBook, a lot of dongles, and you always need to be online \n\n\nAnd even then there is a limit to your functionality.\nNo Bluetooth transfer, no file management, no SD card etc. But for the things they both do, sure the iPhone is smoother. \n\nYou do get minor stutters and bits of lag here and there in Android\/Samsung but you get so much more done.\nI never knew what an absolute game changer DEX was until I started using it! And DEX is just one of many more ways your Android plays better with your other devices.\n\nHaving no dedicated \"back\" button is annoying but then again Android has no dedicated \"undo\" function which is also frustrating. \n\nAs for the camera app...what a strange thing to make an issue about. You can get many camera apps including gcam! Who cares at that point?","1452":"Agreed - iPhone is ridiculously expensive. I hope that it comes down, but I don\u2019t see it happening.","1453":"It feels great because apple invests a lot in the form over function, even when it comes to software. It feels super fast, fluid, etc BUT if you ask me, its not really worth if you don\u2019t want to be locked into apples walled garden. \n\nFrom stupid simple issues like reloading apps and safari not being able to load webm\u2019s, to not being able to download torrents (it\u2019s my phone and the technology is there, just not accessible via the App Store) and the direction that the App Store is going (everything is a subscription because it\u2019s the perfect cushion to keep their unsustainable business app model afloat) make me look to Android for a potential future upgrade.\n\nNot an attack, just my personal feelings on the matter.","1454":"I wonder how expensive is iPhone SE selling at your side. Maybe that will be a good iPhone for you to try out the OS, especially when the phone comes with flagship grade processor","1455":">There's is no way I would spend 6 months of minimum wage in an cellphone\n\ndamn","1456":"If you want a cheaper phone, look at the Pixel 'a' line, or a last-year OnePlus.","1457":"Dang it I'm in the same situation. I've used android for my whole life but I've always admired apple as a company especially for steve jobs. Yet I've never used an iphone as they're super expensive here. I really want the 11 but i cant pay double of what I've payed for s10e. S10e is overall a great, fast and efficient device but as the OP mentioned the hiccups and battery let's me down.","1458":"Some time? I think s10e will be great for at least 4-6 years.","1459":"What about the new iPhone SE?  It has the same internals as the bigger, more expensive siblings.","1460":"I'm a big Android fan and all of my phones have been Android phones (part from a 3 month period with the iPhone 6S Plus as a work phone) but I'm thinking of moving to iPhone next time I upgrade. Not because I dislike Android or anything but I think it could be good to mix things up every now and then and take a peak over the fence and see if the grass is greener.","1461":"Romania, right?","1462":"In Nigeria, you can\u2019t even buy the iPhone 11 Pro unlocked with one year (12 months) of minimum wage \ud83d\ude02. Minimum wage here is $82. \n\nI got my IPhone 11 Pro Max network-locked for $872 after selling my, also network-locked iPhone XS Max for $490.\n\nAgree on the value staying up for longer too. The Galaxy S10+ in Nigeria fell from $927 at launch to just $654 after only 3 months. And by October it was already at $490 for like-new, barely used options. \nOn the other hand, a like-new unlocked IPhone XS Max even now in May 2020 is still around $708.","1463":"6 months minimum wage would be more like 7 grand in the us, more in EU.","1464":">Download and play\/open any file on the fly\n\nyou *can* do that on iPhone. As of iOS 13 there's a function to download any file to the \"Files\" app. It defaults to your iCloud storage (you can choose local storage in Safari settings), idea being - you download a file on the go and pick it up to edit\/review on the iPad or Mac later. \n\nFor sharing files with PC the same \"Files\" app can access an SMB network share. Note that lightning port in all devices apart from 2017 iPad Pro models caps out at USB 2.0 AFAIK, so wireless transfer can be much faster.\n\nYou can also open any file from the \"Files\" app in any supported app. You have to use the share function and select the app you need, it will open the file right from the files app (or even straight from a network share).","1465":"I went iPhone (half by accident, other half cause I wanted to build some iOS apps for fun) but my next phone will be back to Android because of this.","1466":"Yeah, fuck. I wanted to start using my girlfriend's Apple Watch, but I need an iPhone for that so I used her old one. Yesterday, I just wanted to look at her files and copy them to an HDD and be done with it in a second like with my Xperia so I can factory reset it. Well, it's still not fucking done. I can't back it up using the updated iTunes app for some reason (which you need) and I just can't access the files at all\n\nI can't do shit besides looking at her photos that are organized in folders that don't make sense. The fuck is in the ICLOUD01 to ICLOUD3 maps and why do the maps keep changing every time I replug the iPhone. All of a sudden I have ICLOUD06, etc., but no ICLOUD01? And then it changes again. Its not just the name that changes, but also the content of them (looking at the properties of the map and just the number of maps that are there).\n\nI was trying to fix shit for hours and got mad frustrated. This was, ironically, about an hour after I talked to my girlfriend how I'm seriously considering switching to an iPhone because her iPhone 11 is genuinely great. There are way too many things I need that the iPhone just can't do or does less effectively, but her iPhone 11 just works really nice besides those aspects that I just don't know it anymore.","1467":"Could never main an iPhone, unless the hardware was giving a bj or something. The locked Apple ecosystem and lack customization kills iPhone usage for me. Might me ok as a secondary phone.","1468":"One thing that actually had me considering an iPhone for the next round was the syncing of 'picture' folders that you're able to do in iTunes. Mostly because I've been sorting my pictures on the PC to the point where I wouldn't mind having a program that would automatically sync them to my smartphone. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find an Android app that does it well. I've tried a few of the general \"file manager\" apps and Windows programs to see if they'd do something similar, but no luck so far.\n\nI use iSyncr to transfer my playlists and songs to my S9+, and that's always worked like a charm. Music and pictures are usually the only things I would try to transfer between both devices anyway. So the file management deal wouldn't be a deal breaker, for me personally, if it could do those things automatically and decently well.","1469":"im most prob going to an iphone next but keeping my pixel as a secondary device just because of things u mentioned.\n\nAltho my use case for opening files is simply some pdfs and audiobooks so having that on my secondary device isnt a dealbreaker but might be for many people","1470":">\tDownload and play\/open any file on the fly.\n\nYou can do this with an iPhone, what\u2019s the difference with Android?","1471":"Man I'm the same as you. I have both an Android and an iPhone (for work). Now that I tried the iPhone for some year I can say it for sure: iPhone is good for someone that doesn't care about customization and only use default things. \n\nIf you are that kind of basic user that you can use an iPhone. The moment you start useing weird things (hotspot, file manager, icons on the botton of the homepage, etc.) that it's a pain. iPhone simply can't be be personalizaed in any way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso as an Android user, I highly recommend Sony or device with close to stock os. Samsung, huawei, etc heavily change the entire Android experience and I really don't like it.","1472":"Thanks for the lengthy comment, glad you liked my write-up. Agreed with your points, and I\u2019m a techy tinkerer like you too. File management is something the Android has had right for a decade. With customization, it is very fun so I do miss that on iOS. However, for me, I would sacrifice that element in return for this awesome experience on this new iPhone 11 Pro (no need to get into detail there, it\u2019s in the post). \n\niOS now has \u201cshortcuts\u201d and \u201cautomations\u201d that could very well give tasker a run for it\u2019s money, so I hope to see those improving with updates. But yes, you\u2019ve made very solid points in favour of Android.","1473":"You hit the nail on the head here. These two reasons alone are why I will never switch to an iPhone, regardless of the cost or anything else. Customization, including the ability to set default apps and change the keyboard, is an absolute deal breaker for me.\n\nIt's also one of the prime reasons I use a Surface Pro instead of an iPad Pro.","1474":"I have to agree with your statement on the IOS home screen.  So many times I hear people saying IOS is so much cleaner, when to me the home screen reminds me of my 75 year old fathers PC home screen.....just stuff everywhere. I have all my apps(that I use regularly) on my Pixel at the bottom left side of 2 screens so my left thumb can get to everything.\n\nAlso the issue file management on IOS really pushes me away from their devices. They give you a ton of storage space with no way to actually use it the way you want.... it really doesn't make any sense.","1475":"I used to be way into the customization too, and like you I now just want a simple and quick to navigate interface. Apps within reach of my thumb is probably pretty necessary for quickness, so idk if I could handle an iPhone even if for little things like that.\n\nMy most recent two phones can't even have an unlocked bootloader. The versions of phones that are compatible with all US network bands often stay locked and nobody figures it out. So I haven't been able to root my phone since 2015 anyway...","1476":"The shortcuts app on ios is actually pretty robust. Not as insane as tasker, but people have made fairly complicated applications. \n\n[like this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts\/comments\/dccpi5\/the_power_of_shortcuts\/)\n\nThere\u2019s some arbitrary restrictions, like limited access to internal storage, but I\u2019ve been able to make a shortcut for everything I\u2019ve wanted to, such as a 4chan thread finder for the generals I browse","1477":"Regarding the file management, its not quite true anymore. The file manager in iOS 13 is ever so potent as Android file managers are. You can do pretty much anything you would need to do.\nOne thing, which stays true for sure and comes due to the architecture of iOS and the sandboxing of apps, is that you cannot access files of one application in another. This gets certainly annoying when trying to attach files in Gmail for example, but there are workaround, like searching the file in the file manager and sharing it to Gmail from there.\nTo sum it up, I would say file management certainly isn\u2018t a negative\/missing point for iOS after all anymore, at least not for 99% of the users.","1478":"Fyi, if you jailbreak your iPhone\/iPad you will get all the functionality you mentioned that come with android plus all the niche things iOS does better. No one ever compares a jailbroken iPhone to a modern non rootable snapdragon Samsung device( note 10+). Although on the newest iPhones(XS and 11) you had to be on iOS 13.3 to get a jailbreak. All other iPhones\/iPads that use A11 chip or under have a permanent jailbreak.","1479":"Yes it is possible.\n\nIt works by routing your traffic to a local VPN on your device that filters whatever you want.\n\nYou can use Adgaurd Pro, DNS Cloak or lockdown.\n\nWith that said, you still can't block YouTube or Instagram ads due to the way they are delivered. You can use third party apps for that.\n\n[Blokada is preparing an iOS version of their app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/blokadaorg\/status\/1239587817090691087)","1480":"You can use something like AdGuard, but you won't get cosmetic filtering in an app like Chrome, so if white space (from where ads were) bothers you\u2026","1481":"Oh yeah this is a huge factor for me too. I used the adguard DNS URL to block all ads system wide on my S10+ - what a lifesaver. \n\nI haven\u2019t investigated this too much in iOS.","1482":"[deleted]","1483":"I recently made the switch to an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I\u2019ve been a long time android user. I\u2019ve had almost all the Samsung flagships. A couple nexus and pixel devices. While I absolutely love the customization of android and that was mainly what kept me on android, battery life always left something to be desired with all the android phones I\u2019ve used. So when it was time to upgrade my main thing was battery life no matter if it was Samsung, Pixel, Apple, OnePlus, whatever. After some research I found the pro max was one of the best if not the best atm. After 2 weeks with the pro max I feel like I made the right decision. I can go a full day and a half to two days without even thinking about plugging it in to a charger. Battery life has been fantastic and so much better than any other phone I\u2019ve ever used","1484":"Had an OnePlus device loved it but apps would tank the battery and would just keep getting worse and slower with every update. Got an iPhone 6S as a backup phone from my uncle. Ended up becoming my main phone, just upgraded to the SE V2. I know this is an Android subreddit but it\u2019s something Apple shines in I don\u2019t charge it at night and apps just are way smoother such as Spotify.\n\nI do miss some things from Android mainly Google Assistant integration Siri is very weak and I can\u2019t control any of my smart home devices without HomeKit but I\u2019ve ordered a raspberry pi so hopefully I can get around it.","1485":"Agreed with both (1) and (2)! \n\n1. I used Private DNS set to AdGuard's on my S10+ and it was so good. A default setting of the phone being used to block ads was awesome. I currently have no replacement for that on my iPhone but I'm kinda getting over it as most of my apps don't have many ads. But yes, this is a big factor.\n2. YouTube Vanced is probably the only custom apk worth installing (and micro g). I will freaking miss the hell out of this. I'm currently on a YouTube Premium free-trial and I don't know what I'm gonna do when it's gone. iPhone has equivalents like Cercube or YouTube++ but I don't know how to get them working yet.","1486":"You can use systemwide adblocking on iOS, and if you're willing to sideload apps you can just use something like Cercube or Youtube++ (or just pay for Youtube Premium).","1487":"Leaks suggest the notch will be smaller and the speaker will be integrated into the bezel, hope you\u2019re satisfied.\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lzYSpkV.jpg","1488":"Yeah the notch isn\u2019t the best, I\u2019m not a huge fan either. But Face ID, the proximity sensor and the front camera all work well, so I\u2019m not too mad about it. I don\u2019t mind a little bezel, and would rather not have under-display sensors and cameras which is what may happen soon.","1489":"[deleted]","1490":"Notifications I tend to prefer on Android, but on iOS you tend to just forget about them. They kinda handle and auto-hide themselves so you never really think about clearing or managing anything. They don\u2019t auto-dismiss per say but they move to a hidden menu below your new notifications you can then clear if you want.\n\nI do wish the Notification Center better grouped and organized the hidden notifications though. If Apple is going to bulk hide dozens of notifications it would be nice to have a orderly way of browsing through them. Also the fact that shortcuts always make a notification when auto-running is a pain in the ass.\n\nAs a whole though I can see why Apple does it this way. I think it\u2019s a far better way of doing things for the average person who never organizes anything on their phone. It\u2019s nice seeing that my parent\u2019s phones look much more orderly on iOS even though they\u2019re using them the same as when they used an Android phone.","1491":"Yeah I don\u2019t like the iOS notification center much. But for some reason I am enjoying not having a stack of icons in my status bar - weird! But yeah agreed, the notification tray in Android is better. However, I like that every app\u2019s notification can be triggered to wake my phone\u2019s screen (or not) if I want it to. On Android, I believe you can\u2019t do this, or you have to resort to third party apps\/tweaks.","1492":"Notifications are one of my biggest gripes about my iPad Air.  Really don't like that experience. I've had Android phones since the Galaxy S2, but I just made the switch to iOS for my tablet.  Not sure about the phone experience, but it's pretty night and day how much better the tablet experience is...minus notifications.","1493":"OP mentioned file management and customization, but the other thing keeping me on Android for my personal phone is notifications. I have an iPhone for a work phone, and notifications are a dumpster fire in my experience.","1494":"Don't forget the Reddit clients: Sync, Now, Relay, RIF... On iPhone if you don't like Apollo then you're SOL.","1495":"In the case of Tasker, I was surprised by the built in Shortcuts functionality. Not as powerful as Tasker, but also not as convoluted. Also since it's built in third party apps have support for that","1496":"You can only text via an iPhone on a Mac, not on Windows or any other OS.","1497":"Thank you!","1498":"I think you're the first person I've seen who shares the same sentiment with me about the extensive utilization of the edge gestures. The way it can totally revolutionize the way you navigate your phone, away from all the opening of menu pages of apps and options. I've made it so I can don't need to scroll to find and tap an app icon for about 80% of the total functionality of the S10+ for me. I imagine you're on the same wavelength. That alone makes it impossible for me ever switch to such a closed ecosystem like iPhone.","1499":"[deleted]","1500":"How are the airpods on your s10+?\n\nI've been debating on picking up the normal ones as I have weird ears and most normal wireless buds that go in your ear don't stay in mine no matter what tips I use.

I\u2019ve sold my Galaxy watch active, and probably won\u2019t get an Apple Watch anytime soon due to high price. \n\nThe Samsung ecosystem was never that tired together, hence it wasn\u2019t that hard to leave it. I\u2019m a manual backup kinda guy so I just moved all my S10 photos and videos onto my PC abs then I choose a small set of photos to put back into my iPhone. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t really care about keeping my health data so I started fresh on Apple Health.","1522":"Yes, you can use Google Photos or Dropbox to backup your Photos. If you're a Mac user and have iCloud Photos, then it's moot because everything syncs automatically between all of your devices. Drag a photo into Photos on the Mac and it ends-up on your phone. Or vice-versa, drag a photo from Photos to your desktop to share\/attach\/do whatever. Another cool one is using Air Drop to quickly send a photo to one of your Macs. Great when sharing screenshots in an email.","1523":"Exactly. It is so unfair, given that they are the same cost. And I\u2019ll repeat the one thing that annoyed me most - when you do your research and you read reviews on news articles or watch YouTube reviews, often they use the SD version without specifying so you think it\u2019ll be amazing but then you buy the Exynos one and it is inferior.","1524":"Thanks for the feedback, I'm happy you found my writing interesting :) If you haven't seen them already, feel free to check out my 2 tips threads linked at the top of this post or in my blog.

I didn't agree to ads, turned of all Customization Service and everything similar to that. I still got \"recommended video\" ads in Weather which is so stupid, and always got ads in Samsung Health and Samsung Pay (among other apps too). It was such a big turn off, absolutely disgusting from Samsung to have ads on stock apps, especially in a $1000+ flagship phone.\n\nHappy to discuss more.

The phones are about the same speed, but the iPhone seems faster, because of the way they implement animations to hide loading screens. Also the fluidity is on another level.","1529":"Completely agree with you about the smoothness and fluidity. On my OP8 Pro at least, the 120hz refresh rate is amazing. Using my dad's iPhone 11 Pro Max just isn't the same experience.","1530":">  Samsung devices specifically \n\nSamsung literally has the smoothest OS at the moment for Android though...you are about 5 years behind in your approximations of what Android phones do.","1531":"It doesn't matter. All these phones still use Android. \nPerceptible difference? Oh boy. iPhone 5S with an iOS 7 was like phone from another universe compared to what we had at the time. In 2013 we had KitKat. By the time of Android 10 Google barely scrapped some semi decent animations together.","1532":"Yep, but I\u2019ve used more Snapdragon phones when I used to work at a telco","1533":"I've had the iPhone 11 Pro for a little over a month now and it has been fantastic overall. I don't mind a little bit of bezel if it uses the area for useful tech - e.g. face scanning, good front camera, good proximity sensor, speaker, etc. I don't like the push towards 100% bezel-less if it means we make sensors and cameras worse. Have a little bezel and made it useful.\n\nBut I think the SE bezels are far too fat and the design belongs in 2015. However, for the price, it is still a pretty good phone. It's the first time Apple has released a cheap-ish phone with a flagship performance. But I couldn't deal with the SE's lower res LCD screen right now.","1534":"For a beginner in iOS, the SE will suit you good. Just don\u2019t expect the iPhone\u2019s 11\/PRO battery life. Have it for a couple of months and if you like it, sell it and upgrade. The resell value will be almost the same if you take good care of it.","1535":"This post isn't about fan-boy-ism or anything to do with your first sentence.

You can get an s10+ for several hundred bucks cheaper than the base iPhone 11, actually haha. Which means the iphone overall offered MUCH better value buying up front, but also means you could get a pretty damn cheap s10+ as well, even relatively shortly after launch but especially by now. Of course if you did that now and tried to sell it in 1-3 years you'd still get peanuts for it and if you did the same for the iphone you'd get a good deal back still, but i do think IMO the sweet spot for the overpriced androids is waiting ~6 months and getting a virtually bnib model for half the price.

I had the Pixel 1, 2, and 3 and they felt sluggish. I always see the word \"bloat\" tossed out as well and it just doesn't make sense to me. Android is still Android and for the past 3-5 years the \"skin\" on top of it hasn't slowed it down. Having extra apps installed (even bloatware apps) definitely doesn't slow your phone down. \n\nI argue that the S20 is the most \"butter smooth\" phone I have ever used simply because of 120Hz. I experience a \"hiccup\" so rarely with Android phones (since the Pixel 1 times-ish) that I just can't buy this \"butter smooth\" argument any more.

I also like that Samsung's apps have a consistent theme, but Google's slowly been catching up. Using Google apps can be used just as well on any Samsung device and disabling apps isn't the worst.\n\nUpdates also yes. It's not quite as bad as it once was, but it's still very slow.\n\nCamera, Samsung is usually decent enough, for a layman like me I don't care enough to notice much of a difference.\n\nWhen it comes to the look and feel of the ROM, however, I think One UI looks a lot better and the navigation options are better. I mainly care for those two, I suppose.\n\nI hate the on-screen buttons. Being able to swipe up in the places they used to be is amazing and I don't think Google offers that option. This gesture navigation also works with third party launchers.

Over the years I've read complains about multi-window and one handed mode throwing a  message to disable Talkback  to use them.  What makes  it hard not to believe it is the philosophy on their old Tizen Watches: if an app wasn't made with accessibility in mind, it wouldn't let you run it at all while the screen  reader was active. I hope there is  absolutely nothing left of that philosophy in OneUi 5, but anyway the surest way to know would be for me to buy one of their phone and verify for myself.","1970":"I couldn't agree more about the UI design. I hated how inconsistent One UI was on my S21. Sometimes the corner radius was one thing and the other times it was completely different. Sometimes dark mode was a certain black and other times in other apps Samsung apps it was another black, not to mention it was a pain in the ass to fix the design consistency. \n\nSamsung is a massive company. We shouldn't have to fix their design just so it looks okay. It should just look good out and be consistent with the box and be tweakable additionally. \n\n\nI'll also echo this is why iPhone users think android is only for geeks who like to play with their phone. OEMs like Samsung make that seem almost universally true by basically forcing you to micro manage and maintain everything instead of it just working.\n\nPersonally I didn't bother touching android till it got more consistent around android 10. And even then it wasn't even close to iOS. My pixel is as close as Android has ever felt to be being truly cohesive in design.","1971":"I have an S23.

IMO the gold standard is still the old capacitive scanners which had ~100% accuracy.","1974":">There\u2019s no adaptive charging. My Pixel (and all other devices) would not charge to 100% until just before my alarm went off each day, so as to prolong the battery health. There\u2019s nothing like this on Samsung. I managed to create something similar using modes and routines, but it\u2019s horrible and requires a lot of manual intervention if you don\u2019t wake up at consistent times (eg. You have kids or work hybrid and sometimes commute).\n\nYou have battery protect (limit to 85%). And with a simple bixby routine you can disable it 1 hour before waking up.

But I disagree on the part about Samsung's software, OneUI has matured greatly and is way more stable and reliable than any Pixel I've used over the years and I've been using a Pixel along a Samsung for a few years now (Pixel OG\/S9, Pixel 4 XL\/S10e and now Pixel 7\/s23u).\n\nAt first, I was greatly annoyed by how different OneUI was since I was so used to the Pixels but over the years, I've appreciate how useful some of the features and add-ons available to Samsung can be.\n\nOneUI launcher is nicer than Pixel imo, because it holds your previous spot without having to scroll all the way back down when you leave the drawer. Pixel launcher is terrible in that you can't delete at a glance or remove the annoying search bar.\n\nMy hot takes and angry grievances with Pixel:\n\nBattery life is absolutely dogshit on every pixel I've owned. The 'AI' optimized charging is so useless because it is random AF despite using my routines, it charges to 100% so often at night. Pixel biometrics is absolutely trash. My Pixel 4 face unlocked rarely works, and the same goes for the Pixel 7 under screen finder reader.\n\nTldr: Samsung has matured software and great hardware. Pixel has buggy software with terrible hardware.","1976":"> You can always swap launcher to something like Nova, but since Android 10, that\u2019s going to result in a very clunky experience; devoid of the smooth closing animations that only stock launchers can offer, and with pretty broken multi-tasking. If you care about experience, third party launchers just aren\u2019t really viable any more \u2013 the out of the box experience needs to be better.\n\nI feel like not enough people know this but, funnily enough, Samsung are the only brand of Android phone that I know of where third-party launchers **are** usable with gestures. \n\nThe problem with most other Android phones is that they all use the stock ASOP gestures, which do lead to broken animations and lag when swiping up to go home, etc. Samsung, however, [also offer their own variant](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bQqdLJi.png) that allow you to swipe up from each of the three (hidden) navigation buttons at the bottom edge of the screen. \n\nNot only do these gestures work smoothly with third party launchers with zero lag, but they also free up the sides of the display for additional custom gestures via One Hand Operation+. \n\nThis, plus Good Lock allowing users to replace the utterly useless Android one-app-at-a-time horizontal scrolling recents with functional, vertical scrolling cards, are the main things keeping me with Samsung right now.\n\nIf only Google could offer this level of customization on Pixel phones.","1977":"The only thing I have an issue with is the camera with shutter lag and motion blur.

If you can't hack it then I suggest you stay away from advanced customisations such as this. \n\nTbh, a lot of your points and stuff you bring up is just the ultimate nit picking. Doesn't make for an enjoyable read, you sound more like a frustrated child who doesn't want to play with the toys and tools he is provided, such as goodlock but want it all to be done for you. \n\nIf you're going to have a huge wall of nitpicks, at least do the same for the 'good' part too.

I like Samsung's approach of you letting do your own thing in the os instead of \"my way or highway\" that companies like apple and google go with for example.

Do you have any evidence of this? Regardless more than happy to use what I need now than worry about what *may* happen in a year.","2142":"No I agree. Far too much padding in Android 12 onwards.

I'm happy to finally have a proper zoom lens, for instance, and the panoramic shooting is a nice upgrade from the awful Pixel experience. \n\nOne other thought: Have you tried defaulting to Pro mode?","2146":"I have set it up with routines but it's just not as good. Example:\n\nI can replicate sleep mode by telling it to only enable DND when overnight AND charging, but the problem is then when the phone hits 85% battery, it stops charging and thus the DND mode disables. Samsung should have allowed us to choose 'charger connected', rather than 'state: charging', but again, this is a great example of them *technically* doing something, but not understanding the user.\n\nYou also can't properly recreate adaptive charging, by telling it to start charging to 100% in time for the alarm (one varies every day). Routines can't access alarm times so there's no way to set it. You have to manually specify a time where 'battery protect' will turn off, which means I'd have to manually change the routine every time I change my alarm. What's the point in a routine that takes so much manual work? In reality, I can't be bothered and some days I am getting out of bed before my phone has finished charging.\n\nThis is exactly what I mean: Samsung makes you do tonnes more manual work to achieve an inferior result. I'd honestly rather things just worked a bit smarter instead of *having to* micro manage everything manually.","2147":"That's good too hear. I'm sure if you don't constantly have the screen active it will certainly last a long time. My ultra won't even lose 10 percent thruout the .

A lot of people on this sub - specifically Samsung users, unsurprisingly - seem to think that any visual aspect of UI design is subjective.\n\nIt's actually a little insulting as a digital designer. We spend a lot of time reading and sharing hard behaviour data. To have it written off as \"opinion\" is... well somewhere between disrespectful and ill-informed.","2149":"Ah I see, that is neat. Strange that this can't even be achieved in Bixby routines.\n\nBTW, I found your review on the whole pretty interesting. I have an S23U and while I can't say that I've ever noticed or been bothered by many of the UI details you mention, it's still interesting to learn about them. Coming from iPhones, I really appreciate the tweakability of the Samsung phones.","2150":"Yes but 1 thing I don't understand is, why does it matter if it charges to 100 way before your alarm goes off? Samsung has pass through charging and your phone will always charge to 100 and stop at it. Also, phones anyway charge slower from 80-100, so all in all, it doesn't matter much if it charges to 100 at whatevr time it does. Especially because the stand by I assume is pretty good on S23, so even if it does charge to 100 within 1 hour of your sleep it won't lose more than a couple percent by the time you wake up.","2151":"There's a lot of evidence everywhere in research and studies regarding this factor.\n\nLowering the max charging voltage affects two aging parameters: State of Charge and Time.\n\nA lower max state of charge means slower SEI growth, lower rates of electrolyte decomposition and higher structural stability of the binder holding everything together. Furthermore, metal dissolution can be a problem, but that can be mitigated with doping and surface coatants.\n\nAnother very big factor is time spent at higher voltages: the lower amount of time spent at higher voltages, the more cycles the battery will sustain and calendar life will be further improved since other parasitic reactions still happen even when not cycling.\n\nThat's why overnight charging is damaging to long term battery health, which is why well implemented fast charging and optimized night charging can provide huge cycle life benefits in the long run.","2152":"Thank you. Google copied the iOS aesthetic, except iOS control center is much much better designed and condensed. \n\nThis is why I like Samsung, Xiaomi etc. Frankly I'm surprised you say they don't do usability, Things like their redesigned quick settings dropdowns, the side panel, the new multitasking, all of that isn't some random dev - it takes designers, PMs, focus groups, UI testing etc, none of which is cheap. \n\nIf you look at how much $$$ Google spends and what we get vs what we get from the others, not to mention custom roms done by hobbyists for free, its hard to argue that Google is in any way better.\n\nSadly this attitude of dismissing all other Android skins and treating Google stock like some holy grail is the standard in tech reviews. People forget that so many features like double tap gestures, long press on tiles (which Google removed), double swipe etc were introduced by others and then copied by Google.","2153":"I'm not a good enough photographer to use pro mode :( I don't understand most of the terminology - just want a good point and click.\n\nIt also makes you manually manage the lenses for zooming etc which is a bit of a bummer.\n\nOne of the reasons I bought this phone was for the zoom lens, but interestingly the Pixel's computational zoom has been shown to be better, which is super strange. Imagine if they put a zoom lens on the smaller Pixel!\n\nWhat's the deal with panoramic mode?

The one on the S23 is operationally similar to the iPhone, very easy to use, and appears to get more consistent results in my preliminary testing so far.","2156":"Nah there's tonnes of quality of life stuff missing from Samsung.\n\nLike I said, adaptive charging.\n\nNo magnifier when selecting text.\n\nNo wrist gestures to flip camera.\n\nUnable to change icon shapes (except a really clunky legacy homeup way that doesn't work properly).\n\nNo way to get a vertical nav drawer without sacrificing transition animations.\n\nIt goes on and on. Like, I feel like it gives me a lot of choices, but none of them are good looking or work seamlessly. So I'd prefer fewer, good choices.\n\nAside from a few bits, MiUI and ColourOS have very similar customisation options to Samsung in the areas that matter, but their UI\/UX designers are far stronger.","2157":"[deleted]","2158":"Oh neat! It isn't a type of photo I often take so will give it a try.\n\nI've been messing with pro mode this afternoon. It seems most settings remain on auto which is great, but it doesn't have HDR at all so shadows and highlights lose all detail :( Photos are significantly worse unless you manually tweak the shadows and highlights which isn't really great for taking quick snapshots of my family.\n\nGod I wish I didn't have to trick this thing into taking good photos.

Airdrop is something I use daily for work and personal stuff. Quick tethering of internet to the Mac is very convenient\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what do you mean about Apple Pay.

Plus, I believe AirPods perform worse on Android (probably not majorly so) because of the specialized wireless chip they have to communicate with IOS devices.\n\nThere are actual apps and accessories that differ between platforms. It's not that the ecosystem is a purely mental state. It's about how needy\/locked-in a user is with those devices and services. I've deliberately tried to steer clear of such products so I don't get stuck with the side-effects.","2167":"[removed]","2168":"At a base level, sure. Let\u2019s talk about AirPods for example. They play music over Bluetooth, same as any other Bluetooth headphones. \n\nBut here\u2019s where the \u201cecosystem\u201d comes in. My AirPods auto switch (pretty seamlessly) between my iPhone and iPad. I don\u2019t have to worry at all about pairing. They also pair to my Apple TV so I can listen to audio without disturbing others. If I have Apple Music, I get Spatial Audio. I also get spatial audio on my iPad watching certain content. \n\nOr handoff or airdrop. It makes it pretty easy to share content to others or pick up where you left off. Even something small like Apple Pay\u2026I bought something online using Apple Pay and as part of the check out process for a notification on my watch to verify the transaction. \n\nApple devices play well together and you get more benefits with the more devices you have.  Sometimes you have to deal with limitations but apple is getting better each year (eg Safari extensions are fantastic now).","2169":"I think you are trivializing the extent that an integrated user experience matters to groups of users.  No, it's not life-ending to not be able to use imessage, but the way it just works puts to shame the sad state of rich messaging on android.  That all being said, I don't even care about text messaging on android and I hardly use it--I'm even in the USA, and text messages are no more than an afterthought to me.\n\nAnd adding more 3rd party apps as go-betweens isn't a better approach.  Having options is...having options,.    \n\n>The Pixel Buds work just as great as the AirPods as far as doing what they need to do\n\nI'm not an apple fan, but even so, I vehemently disagree, having gone through two pairs of the pixel buds and still have problems, with basic functionality like not cutting out.  Much less google assistant spoken notifications just not working when they choose, and the \"something went wrong\" message when I'm just trying to change the volume.","2170":"The ecosystem definitely exists, and is not all mental. Like many others have said, there's a lot of added benefits with using Airpods with Apple devices, Airdrop, Continuity, Handoff, etc.  \n\nThe best way to make it easy to switch across companies is to use cross platform solutions - Google Suite, Evernote, etc. I usually avoid using platform specific products\/software for this very reason.","2171":"Is the whole green bubble and wanting to be in the ecosystem an American thing? \n\nI only ask as in the UK absolutely no one I know cares about iMessage. Half the people I know have iPhones and half have some android phone. Everyone uses WhatsApp for group messaging. I've never been in a situation where I craved having iMessage. \n\nThe whole ecosystem is fair enough. It would be nice to have an iPhone, watch and iPad all synced but a high end android phone and an iPad seems like a good combination to me. Best of both worlds! \n\nLike Samsung sells a lot of their phones. It feels kind of weird to me that people would use iMessage for a group knowing full well that the app is limited to a certain phone.","2172":"That\u2019s all wrong. Apple doesn\u2019t trap you in - I use an iPhone 12 mini and every service and app I use is the same as what I used on my android phones and tablets. I could switch to an android phone again tomorrow and nothing would change.","2173":"It's not just the phone though. Continuity on MacBooks is great. Same with the integration of the AirPods on different devices. The Apple Watch is in a class of its own. Accessory support is unmatched. And most people are within driving distance of an apple store to get in-person support.\n\nAndroid support for certain products, especially from small companies, is usually secondary to iOS support.\n\nThat's the real power of ecosystem. It's not really about the apps on the phone. It's Apples clout as a company as a whole.","2174":"Speaking from a U.S. perspective, the problem with Android is the carriers.  They have completely ruined messaging for the platform.  I much prefer to have an Android phone but the messaging situation in the U.S. is shit.  There is also the issue of bloatware and withholding features from unlocked Android phones such as Visual Voicemail and HD voice.  It\u2019s those reasons that keep me with iPhone.","2175":">I no longer care about what the club wants. I use green bubbles? Oh well. Want to send me a better quality video? Get WhatsApp. You don't want to? I'll be ok without your video. It's ok.\n\nThis mentality is why videos sent by text suck and social media apps on Android are a roll of the dice.\n\nAs an Android community we should be demanding Google\/carriers\/developers solve basic issues such as uploading a video in decent quality or being able to text a photo without first having to upload to another app.","2176":"I would agree with most of this.   I've used both, prefer Android, but yeah, they both are fine and provide pretty much everything you need.\n\nOne nitpick though.   Google Pay is not \"accepted in more places\" than Apple Pay.\n\nBy definition, they are both just NFC payment systems.   Effectively they are exactly the same thing, using exactly the same protocol at the checkout counter.   They are just brands of a technology introduced by MasterCard.","2177":"I still love the apple ecosystem and why i have an iphone and a s21 ultra.","2178":"I fully agree.  I've been primarily android since the OG droid but I've had stints where I got bored and gave iphone a shot.  I honestly never had any issue going back and forth between the two.  Admittedly, I never went all in on apple products but I'm perfectly able to swap my sim into an iphone, use my galaxy buds pro and cast video and music to my google home devices.  The only real argument comes in watches as the apple watch won't work on android and I believe the galaxy watch 4 no longer works on ios after switching over to wear os.  That's a minor issue though.","2179":"Went from XS Max to Pixel 6 (for purely $$$ reasons) and couldn't be happier. Both OS's are honestly so close in day to day use that transitioning wasn't much of a learning curve at all.","2180":"Android doesn't have good small phones like the se 2020 or 12 mini.\n\nI hate huge phones. Android phones are huge.","2181":"I still love the Apple ecosystem and nothing comes close to Apple Watch. I love using apple fitness+, better app ecosystem support on my watch and continuity on Mac, iPad and how well they all work together.\n\nI still love and use android phones as my secondary (currently S21 ultra and pixel 6 pro), but apple ecosystem is my preferred by choice because they offer more to me as an ecosystem of devices\/services.\n\nAs far as messaging, I use WhatsApp, iMessage, regular messages, telegram, slack , teams, Facebook messenger or whatever one wants to use \ud83d\ude02 \u2026\u2026 honestly don\u2019t care and I\u2019ll communicate wherever one wants to communicate.","2182":"I get you, but I think ecosystem still matters to people that want technology that just works. Android still doesn't have that 'just works' set of products. Tablets suck. Wearable's suck. ChromeOS sucks. Google Pay sucks.","2183":"I don't understand the appeal of imessage or whatever.\n\nYou're using a phone, just use sms","2184":"Well lets be honest, everything that isnt apple does work shittier on an apple device, missing features and such. I notice it too much when using my iphone and it is quite frustrating, and the worst thing about owning something from apple: its too closed to be used how i need to or want to use it. Truth is, apple offers services, not products per se. Everything is meant to be used for their services and other made for apple things, not the other way around like android or windows. Last ones are maybe not as polished but do work with almost everything as they should.","2185":"To address one point. Samsung has the absolute best media sharing solution with Link Sharing.","2186":"The ecosystem argument has long been a myth. The Android, especially Google, ecosystem is just as robust and more wide-reaching than Apples. If you're using the Google Assistant setup with smart home, the setup is second to none and much bigger than a phone tablet headphones and watch working together nicely. Add in Gsuite a Chromebook and a pair of Fast pair enabled headphones, and you have a very similar setup. I honestly doubt I would be able to have such a neatly integrated home system with Apple HomeKit. Just to be clear I'm not dumping on Apple, they built a very robust experience across their products, I'm just saying that Google has a just as nice ecosystem it just involves different moving pieces.","2187":"My old phone (Galaxy S10) was able to screen cast to my JVC Smart TV without any issues.

The only part that is really \"mental\" is getting stuck in the tribalism that some users have about their brand. iOS users, especially younger ones, can be especially toxic about the \"green bubble\". If you're an adult, you're being really childish and immature if you still mock that one \"green bubble\" friend. Also, it's silly to suggest that Apple Pay\/Google Pay are an ecosystem locking feature. They're essentially the same.\n\nGetting \"stuck\" in an ecosystem is 100% dependent on the apps you buy, the games you play, and the peripherals you use. If you've spent 10 years playing games or buying apps in the iOS ecosystem, good luck getting all that over without losing data\/progress of some kind or having to rebuy all of your premium apps. Apple-produced products work better or exclusively on iOS devices. All others are near-universal.","2202":"Re Bluetooth audio quality:  As I understand it Apple is all in on AAC codec via Bluetooth and they make sure their devices all support that very well. AAC is fine, good even, if well implemented. Android prefers to use slightly better codecs like LDAC and APTX and few to no Android OEMs have bothered to optimize for AAC. So when an Android phone connects to AirPods it will use AAC because AirPods don't have APTX\/LDAC but it will sound worse and use more battery compared to an iPhone because Android's AAC support isn't very good. On the other hand a high quality 3rd party headset supporting APTX\/LDAC will sound worse on the iPhone because it will likely have to fall back to SBC (the worst of all) or hopefully AAC if available.","2203":"There are things that straight up won't work on non Apple products.

I can send that same video to a Verizon iPhone, and when they send it back it looks like shit.\n\nI've done this testing many times.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with MMS as a *transport*. The problem is the lack of consistency between carriers, and no standard for the application layer, which becomes responsible for ensuring delivery, error correction, etc.\n\nAfter all, other than embedding attachments in cell frames (which MMS doesn't do with smart phones anyway, only with feature phones and older phones), it's just hosting files on HTTP servers.","2218":"We have been. For years now.","2219":"The only difference is Apple Pay on the web seems more widely supported in my experience - using the Apple Pay option on a site\u2019s checkout on an apple device lets you pay with Touch ID\/Face ID\/your Apple Watch (if you\u2019re on a Mac without a biometric authentication) whatever without having to fill out any details (card, delivery address etc.)","2220":"So do I. But I switched my primary to S21 because I got tired of not using what I really love as a phone due to others.","2221":"The mini lineup may get axed by apple next year apparently","2222":"The Zenfone 8 is a pretty good option if you want a good Android phone on the smaller side  \nEdit: Fixed \"Zenphone to Zenfone\", whoops","2223":"Good of you. Many iPhne users (mainly USA) don't like downloading other apps to communicate. \n\nAnd yes the watch and iPad are basically shattering all else.","2224":"If the iPhone covers most of your daily needs, what do you do with your secondary Android? Why carrying multiple phones if one can cover it all?","2225":"Lol this comment is atleast 7 years old. \n\nSamsung has a pretty decent ecosystem going on. Maybe not on par with Apple especially with their laptops needing more work, but everything else works pretty well.","2226":"Samsung ecosystem is more fuss free than apple's.  You can use DEX\/Samsung flow\/link-to-windows to interface your phone to any pc\/mac\/Samsung tablet.  You can do exactly like apple ecosystem including continuity, text, call and share data from your pc\/ mac\/tablet to phone.   Best of all, you dont have to be using the same login on all devices like Apple (which is a pain).  \n\nWhat can apple watch do better than Samsung watch being a WATCH, not a miniaturized iPhone.  Nothing.","2227":"iMessage is just sms between iPhones... There is no additional app or anything.","2228":"You know how every phone has that one shitty default texting app? That is iMessage, except it\u2019s just usable enough to not having to bother downloading Signal or Whatsapp","2229":"Well actually, and I'll use messaging apps as an example, messaging apps seem to work better on Apple?\n\nI find WhatsApp and Signal to be smoother and better looking with better features in an iPhone than Android.","2230":"I've found its cumbersome, and sucks for anyone not on a samsung","2231":"what's with nearby share?","2232":"It\u2019s not as developed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as robust (more moving parts\/protocols = more flaky and finicky) but I agree that it\u2019s more wide reaching.  You definitely don\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve properly explored the depth of integration apple devices have. \n\nSome examples:\n1. You buy an Apple TV - you hold an iPad or iPhone near to it at setup and it syncs across your account etc. This applies to all their devices - hold one near the other for setup, and it\u2019s getting more developed with UWB. \n2. AirPods auto switch between iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch and you can select them on your Apple TV and it connects with no sync issues etc. This also expands to HomePods - get up the Apple TV airplay menu and all your HomePods and AirPods throughout the house appear and can be easily selected - there is zero fiddling with syncing, Bluetooth, setup menus, they\u2019re just always there\n3. You need to authenticate an Apple Pay transaction on your computer, your Apple Watch pops up asking you to double press the side button to authenticate. \n4. You click on \u2018send to iPad\u2019 on your Mac and the app opens up on your iPad as an extended screen and you can drag things across\n5. You take a screenshot on your Mac with an iPad nearby and the screenshot appears on your iPad to be annotated with the Apple Pencil. \n6. Hold and iPhone near a HomePod and it vibrates and \u2018peeks\u2019 an interface on your phone that pops up fully when you\u2019re close enough using UWB. \n7. You get a call, it comes through on your iPad, Mac, phone, watch. You can answer on any of them, switch, and you can get up the audio menu and can switch the audio to any of the devices, HomePods, AirPods etc during the call\n8. Something is playing on your phone\/HomePods\/Apple TV and the play controls appear on your watch \n9. You can\u2019t be bothered to find your Apple TV remote, the remote with Siri support is built into your iPad\/iPhone with all the features in control centre. This also works in that you go on a text field on Apple TV and a notification pops up on your iPhone\/iPad and you can expand the notification and type it there and it appears on the tv. \n10. Universal control, when it finally comes out, allowing the cursor to move between multiple devices and OS\u2019s (not just an extended screen) with drag and drop support looks to be the ultimate flex of properly developed ecosystem features \n\nThere are lots more subtle things like this that are very complicated on the backend and just \u2018work\u2019 that you wouldn\u2019t even know existed without actually properly getting into the ecosystem and living with it for a while. To do most of these with Google is either impossible, complicated, a fudge, requires multiple logins, has to be setup, or is just laggy and doesn\u2019t work half the time. \n\nI also think HomeKit is more stable and versatile (via shortcuts) than Google Home (I\u2019ve got some Nest devices as well as Hue lights, Ikea tradfir plugs etc synced to both Google home and apple HomeKit) - the only real advantage to Google home is there are more devices certified to work with it. Definitely not a fan of the Google Home app,","2233":"Google home isn\u2019t great either.\n\nRing is the superior product and obviously it works equally well for iOS and android.  \n\nA lot of this comes down to preferences.  If you are so into google\u2019s camp that you are literally using a chrome book, then yeah Google ecosystem is great.\n\nSame with Mac users, they go with Apple.\n\nFor window users, which are the vast majority, neither Apple or google\u2019s ecosystem works that well with windows - they work, but you can windows is not their preferred desktop OS.\n\nFor most people the vast majority of their apps should essentially work the same across android or iOS.","2234":"I got 2 grips.","2235":"This was the most obvious move for Google, but with their messaging \"strategy\" history, one can tell the most obvious things is what they never do. Still waiting to use it with a Google Voice number.\n\nIronically I can use iMessage and Facetime with any email account, not just an Apple email. Duo still requires a phone number if you're using it from a phone.","2236":"> Tell that to 95 percent of my friends who use iPhone. Multiplatform benefit is diminished if almost everyone uses one platform.\n\nI've never seen or even heard of one of these supposed weird iPhone only circles in real life though. The only place I _ever_ heard people say this is online, and even then only from people in the US.","2237":"Without iMessage you are committing social suicide without even knowing it. Just look at the common narrative about [Green Bubbles](https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/search?f=realtime&q=%22green%20bubbles%22&src=typd), it\u2019s very common to leave ppl out of group chats because green bubbles are poors.","2238":"No.","2239":"Android has a disconnect button. When I press that my cheap ass earbuds connect to my laptop instead.","2240":"In some countries you get charged extra for a picture message which is exactly what made WhatsApp so popular in Europe.\n\nFrom what I've seen on Reddit picture messages are included with most plans. Without picture messaging being free IMessage is basically pointless because you can't use the SMS fallback feature without being charged.","2241":"Samsung is trying, and I gotta admit some of it actually works pretty well.","2242":"It\u2019s not. WhatsApp wrecks them even there. Let\u2019s take two countries here\u2026 UK and Japan. Guess what rules in these countries?? WhatsApp and line two cross platform messengers which work perfectly fine","2243":">Apps like WhatsApp are really popular in countries that have expensive phone plans and it's cheaper to just use wi-fi out data only to communicate\n\n? Are you inventing this nonsense to protect your idiotic American exceptionalism or something?\n\n\nBecause these kind of apps are popular across all western Europe, for example Whatsapp in the Netherlands and FB messenger in Belgium, and internet there is MUCH better than in the USA.

But the ecosystem for me has been a little less of a pull considering how much I prefer the freedom of android(that's mixed too) and the flexibility of having a Windows laptop. \nAre u invested in the ecosystem?","2247":"Apple copies Android 5 years later and act like it's new! Apple is overpriced garbage and their Apple Store where they \"fix\" your Apple product for expensive prices! Never take your Apple product to an Apple store to get it fixed, they just tell you it's a $300 part that's broken then when you take it to a 3rd party store to fix it and it's a $40 part! People that buy a new Apple phone every year are suckers!","2248":"Best is debatable when you are forced to use iOS.","2249":"I am one of those people with WhatsApp at least. I don\u2019t want any Facebook owned stuff on my phone. I do have another chat app, but It definitely adds a point of friction in the whole user experience having to move out of the default for just one person in a big group. Not with the friendship, just with default ease of use.","2250":"[deleted]","2251":"SMS isn't expensive everywhere. Here in Australia pretty much every phone plan, even prepaid, includes unlimited sma.","2252":"Why would aptX be better than AAC? Isn\u2019t AAC a more efficient codec?","2253":"My Sony WH1000-XM3 sound the same to me on AAC with an iPhone as they do on LDAC on an Android. I doubt there are many audio setups where you\u2019ll notice a difference honestly.","2254":"I'm not inherently against proprietary things. I don't believe a company is obligated to support competing products, even if it's what I want to make the market as good as it can be. I think Lightning is a stupid connector that should have died with USB-C (which Apple seems to agree with on everything EXCEPT the iPhone).\n\nWhile I believe a company has a right to make those decisions, I will also sometimes avoid companies for making those decisions. As they are free to create products in that manner, consumers are free to reject them. My Surface Pen works on my HP laptop, but an Apple Pencil would not. I don't mind that Logitech's Lightspeed wireless isn't some open standard that works on every mouse or keyboard. I try to be selective though, and will avoid products when I feel the company is being needlessly difficult to monopolize the market and drive out competitors.","2255":"[removed]","2256":"\u201cUnless you live outside the US\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s 7 billion people in the world. 300m of them are in the US.","2257":"The only notification 2FA I get is my Google, MS, Apple and bank accounts. Everything else is \"open authy, copy the code\"","2258":"If you think you can't trust companies like Todoist, Evernote, Amazon and Spotify, might as well not use a smartphone and use a basic phone instead. Apple says it's all secure and private, but then opens up CSAM detection, which is probably just a start. \n\nThere is literally no company I would trust my data with, but that makes it impossible or very hard to use technology. The only way to do that would be to stop using a smartphone or a laptop.","2259":"And how is having everything under one account better?

My brother and I tried forever to figure something out, but never could. I always thought it was because he was on an iPhone, and me on Android.\n\nWhat is happening that it only sucks on Verizon?","2267":"I have voluntarily disabled MMS with my carriers on both of my SIM cards.","2268":"I think this is only if you are using an iOS device.(obviously) When I\u2019m using a pc or Android I don\u2019t see that Apple Pay is accepted everywhere so maybe that\u2019s why op thinks it\u2019s worse.","2269":"I think that would be a real mistake on Apple's part!\n\nA lot of people do not want a cellphone the size of a roofing tile!","2270":"Even if they do, you\u2019d still have a great phone for a couple of years and who knows how the market will look by the device\u2019s end of life?","2271":"Thanks that is a possibility!","2272":"I do look into iPhones quite a bit, but I'd never fully ditch android even if I switched. There is quite a lot of stuff I enjoy about my current phone, but am not as convinced by what Samsung has nowadays(ik Pixel is good, but Google doesn't officially sell Pixel phones where I live, so importing it from the USA will end up making me spend more money than what an iPhone would go for, and won't even support call screening etc). I do see a point as there are bits to both that are amazing.","2273":"How so? Samsung just dumped Tizen for WearOS. They have Samsung Pay over Google Pay. Their tablets have limited updates. They use Dex over ChromeOS. Samsung even tries to replace core apps with their own App Store, further fragmenting the ecosystem. If you buy any Samsung accessory, they're crippled if you try to use them on competitor phones (e.g ear buds or wearable). There isn't a universal stylus like the Apple Pencil. It's a damn mess.","2274":"For *you*. Try getting your grandma to setup link-to-windows. With Apple you literally have to do nothing to get continuity. That's one single login instead of three (Windows, Android, Samsung). That's not ecosystem, it's a mish-mash of incompatible products duct taped together. It's not easy, friendly, or useful. Some of my favorite apps are available on Apple Watch like Pocket Casts. You can't even get offline podcasts on WearOS without doing file transfer like a caveman. You're thinking like a tech-savvy consumer, not like a person who can barely work a toaster. Android puts too many steps in the workflow, Apple removes those road-blocks.","2275":"I dont use them, but fb messengeris is just hopeless on ios, so bad...and telegram is sometimes iffy too.","2276":"I've seen that fb messenger utterly destroys the photo quality of pictures sent from Android devices. \n\nI've got a friend with an s21 and I think photos get sent at like 1MP.

Both work well mostly with their own products, Apple more than Samsung, but Samsung still gets the basics right. I would take the Samsung ecosystem anyday over Apple's simply because it runs on Android and comes with all its perks.

I love the 7 Pro's hardware but man, the software is a huge letdown. Quality software matters a lot especially when moving from iOS, but it seems to get harder and harder finding an OEM that doesn't have a massive roster of devices to support with updates so that they can focus on quality of life improvements on flagships that are more than a year old.\n\nLike a lot of other 7 Pro users\/enthusiasts, I'm hoping the Pixel lineup delivers on the hardware and software front this year. Idk what OEM I'd move to next, and iOS isn't as open as I'd like for me to consider having it as my daily again.","2354":"Don't want to sound combative but are notifications really better on iOS?  I feel like Android's notification system is pretty much perfect and is one of the many things preventing me from making a switch to iPhone.

I\u2019ve heard iOS can sideload similar apps, but it\u2019s just much easier on Android.","2357":"I've also been using the OnePlus 7 Pro for 2 years now. Bought it at launch when my OnePlus 3 was no longer worthy of a daily driver due to severe overheating, very slow and a battery that could only hold a charge for 2 hours, I decided that the 7 Pro was a perfect upgrade at the time. Do note that I have a OnePlus 9 Pro in my pocket as well, so at the moment I can compare the 2 phones.\n\nI just want to have a friendly conversation about some of the points that you're making, as well as adding some more information from a different kind of user to this review.\n\nCamera:\n\nYes, I agree that the cameras aren't perfect and agree with a lot of points that you said about them. However at launch they were much worse than they are now. They improved them a lot in terms of color calibration, less noise and better sunlight performance. Yes, the color calibration is different between the 3 lenses but the versatility overcomes this in my opinion, especially for a 1st gen triple camera setup. Compared to the 9 Pro, the 7 Pro's main 48mpx camera holds up really well, only losing out when it's dark or when having to photograph shadows in bright surroundings.\n\nDisplay:\n\nI missed something in your review. How it handles itself as a multimedia device. I am one of those users that doesn't care about the battery life, so I have both QHD, as well as 90Hz enabled ever since I owned the 7 Pro. \n\nFor media consumption, this is the best phone out there. The screen is beautiful, easily calibrated manually to your liking in the settings, as well that it has a great set of dual speakers with Dolby sound. It is the best phone to watch movies on, hands down. My 9 Pro can't do this, as it has a hole punch. Yes, it has a nicer display with 120Hz, but as a pure movie watching machine, the 7 Pro is better. As for scrolling on social media, browsing the web, etc, the 7 Pro's 90Hz is a must for me nowadays. However this brings me to something that I missed in your review entirely...\n\nSpeed:\n\nAs someone that does care about speed, I can safely say that the 7 Pro is pretty much still as fast as at launch. The only thing that has changed are the system animations, which slowed those down a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary. I missed this entirely in your review. Speed isn't just for games, it's about the entire experience. How fast it opens apps, how fast it opens a webpage, that all adds up to the experience, and OnePlus bags on that a lot. You only know that it is 'slower' than newer flagships (aka the 9 Pro in my experience) when holding them side by side and opening the same app at the same time. And even then, it's not that you're having to wait 3 seconds longer to open an app like Instagram. The difference is minimal. It just feels fast. OnePlus banks on their speedy experience and is one of their main selling points. However if (like you) you don't care about that, then there are better phones to buy if you'd ask me; Galaxy S10 for instance.\n\nSoftware, OxygenOS and updates:\n\nI know that compared to iOS, that update speeds are not up to par. And I agree with that, it sucks. You pay a lot of money for a sub-par update experience.\n\nWhat I wanted to add to your review, is something else that I missed: bugs and stability.\n\nWhen I first got the 7 Pro, now over 2 years ago, it had OxygenOS 9 (aka Android 9) running on it. It was an absolute charm. Probably the best experience that I've had on an Android device... \n\nUntil Android 10 came along. God that was an awful update. Countless bugs, stability issues, but most annoying was the fact that I went from 8-10 hours of SOT on a single charge, to 5-6 hours of SOT, with the exact same usage. Mind you, I am one of those users that if I'm not using Bluetooth or mobile data actively, I turn it off to save battery. I instantly lost 30-40% of my charge just by upgrading to Android 10. That really angered me but not enough to jump back to Android 9. Android 10 only brought 1 good thing in my experience, system wide dark mode. The rest of it was worse compared to Android 9. It was less smooth, had many bugs that weren't fixed until the release of Android 11 (making it over a year to fix tiny bugs). It was so bad, I've never seen this amount of bugs before on stable software. \n\nI am one of those users that when I see a bug, I report it to the developers. The process itself is nothing special, but the lack of response by the bug hunters, as well as that bugs that were present at the beginning of Android 10 weren't fixed until the release of Android 11, really made it tough to swallow.\n\nAndroid 11 has been a bit of a mixed bag so far but definitely better than Android 10. Wether you like or dislike the new style, let's leave that aside. On the one hand, pretty much all bugs that got introduced in Android 10 have been fixed. The phone's performance hasn't yet been there though, until 11.0.2.1 (which is the latest stable update for Europe\/unlocked phones). Now it is smooth, fast and the battery is better than on previous A10 and A11 builds.\n\nFeature wise though, OxygenOS is everything that I want, can't complain about that. Double tap to wake and skipping tracks while the screen is turned off are freaking amazing, I love the gestures (and that I can turn off the navigation bar at the bottom) and the OnePlus launcher is the best OEM launcher, period. To add to that, I have 2 SIM cards and having the option to run 2x Whatsapp accounts on one phone thanks to the Parallel Apps feature is very handy.\n\nNotifications are great though in my experience compared to you, simply because you can turn off individual notifications for every single app, so that you can customize which notifications you do and don't get. It's different to iOS, sure.\n\nAnd then there's the little things, the vibrations motor, the 90Hz, the only Android phone with a hardware mute switch all add up for me to love this phone.\n\nAnd yet... Then the most important question comes up. Would I buy OnePlus again? Well you might be confused by my answer because I own a OnePlus 9 Pro as well (like I said before). I received this OnePlus 9 Pro for free and who wouldn't say yes to a free phone, especially when you put a lot of time in for the other person... But the answer to my question, would I spend my own money and buy another OnePlus? I have both phones in  front of me currently...\n\nWell yes and no. But mostly no.\n\nI love the hardware and the features that OnePlus bring. It's just that Android 10's awful experience really didn't do them any favors and it took them a few months to make Android 11 'usable' as well... As well as that they are now integrating to Oppo, it's gonna take some time for them to impress me again.\n\nNot to bash you or your review in any way or form, I agree with a lot of things that you said. I just wanted to add some things. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc","2358":"This was a good writeup, although i am surprised to see that notification was an aspect where you gave an edge to Apple, i found the android notification more robust and intuitive then iOS, i think it comes down to preference, because notifications are one of the main reason i am apprehensive about getting an iPhone, also i didn't get what you meant by photo file management system, works perfectly fine for me but then again i am not using OxygenOS so maybe it's an OxygenOS thing and, if you want a better experience in terms of connectivity between your PC and Phone i would highly recommend you try KDE connect, it has all the functions that you can ask for a PC companion app for(except maybe screen sharing).\n\nI would also not recommend Oneplus the way they are now, i heard about the Oneplus update issue's but i never imagined being this bad, pushing an update that brick's user device is just plain stupidity.\n\nAnyway, thanks for this detailed writeup, as an Android-only user, it was nice to see things from another perspective.","2359":"My OP7 Pro is also 2 years old this week - the phone has been great, but I've gotten some very deep scratches on the screen, which I think shouldn't be possible \/I usually take very good care of my phones)\n\nSeems like the glass scratches very easily in my opinion.","2360":"Good review","2361":"Solid review. As a fellow OnePlus 7 Pro owner, you nailed it.","2362":"Regardng the charging tech, last I read, there are 3rd party companies that offer 15-18W charging (similar to DASH charge).

They may look great on paper, but after some usage you will start noticing the shortcomings which are quite a few such as:\n\n1. There's no proximity sensor, they just use the gyro to determine if you are talking over the phone and switch off the screen. Many times I have hanged or activated the airplane mode while in a conversation.\n2. Auto-brightness works really bad and I find myself manually adjusting it all the time.\n3. Updates are very very slow, and when they come they are bugged. I'm not your typical complainer after each update, but here I have to admit that OnePlus is very bad.\n4. The camera is average at best. If I had to put it on words, I would say it is not trustworthy.\n\nSo my options in Android are narrowing down, I just want a phone that works in its most basic things, dependable, supported, with Android without any bullshit. My option right now is just Pixel, I have considered iPhone but, despite having iOS in my tablet, I don't like it for a phone.","2365":"Still rocking the 7 pro with [Android 9](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Sx992eK.jpg) 2 years later \n\n90hz and pop-up camera are still my favorite, I don't want to switch phones until under-screen camera","2366":"[removed]","2367":"So, which phone(s) do you like?","2368":"Awesome review.

Before my LG V60, the OnePlus 7 plus was favorite phone. The only this I hated about it was being able to take pictures with moving subjects and night photos.","2372":"My Gf has this phone and loves it.","2373":"Had no issues with accidental touches with my O7p in 2 years  with the exception of youtube so I honestly think that might be a youtube app problem","2374":"I've had the exact same phone, with T-Mobile as well, and although it's been a mostly good experience, I have had a horrible time with messaging and calling. For the majority of my time owning the phone I would miss out on text messages unless I was connected to wifi and I couldn't use wifi calling. Sometimes I'd also miss on phone calls. Just a couple weeks ago it finally seems to have fixed itself and I've been able to wifi call. I also just got my visual mailbox to work for the first time since I got the phone. I'm not sure if those were carrier issues or os issues, but I don't think I'll be buying another OnePlus.","2375":"I've never purchased an iphone because I've tried a few ones with my friends and it's a big nope for me in many aspects. But the notifications... are one of things that I could never use. I remember scrolling and seeing thousands of rows, that was pretty confusing for me. So... I think it really comes down to preference. I prefer my notifications more organized, and as others have pointed out in this post, you can customize a lot of the notificacions.","2376":"Great write up of your user experience. Much appreciated.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","2377":"I had a OnePlus 7T. It was fine till it was running Oxygen OS 10.

I also have an iPhone 11 and I love the stability and smoothness of iOS","2378":"Thanks, appreciate it!","2379":"No problem! I'm also on a legacy PowerTap, and it really is disappointing that it no longer works. Concerning whether this is Android 11 or OP, I have read threads about it not working for Samsung phones either so I believe it is Android 11.","2380":"Thanks! And yeah, there's definitely a lot of quality of life things that I feel like are severely lacking on Android\/OxygenOS. Nevertheless it's not enough of a deal breaker for me to switch back to iOS. As for next OEM, pixel, Sony, and Samsung are the ones I'm looking out for (not that I feel the need to upgrade anytime soon).","2381":"[deleted]","2382":"No worries, this is the kinda conversation I'm always excited to have. In my personal experience, notifications on iOS have always worked like this: I get a notification, pull out my phone and swipe the notification bar down, and it's right there on the top. If I get 5 notifications (feel my phone vibrate 5 times in my pocket), and swipe the bar down, those 5 notifications are at the top. Hasn't been my experience on Android. Of course this is all down to preference and what you're used to, but that's my take on it.","2383":"That also seems to be the general consensus for people who use or switch back and forth between both operating systems.","2384":"That's what I thought too, a lot of iOS users asked for better notifications in the last years and Apple only delivered improvements in the last 1 or 2 versions and further improving them in iOS 15. That point is a bit strange, the rest of the review seems overall well done.\nAlso idk if it is a custom ROM feature but new notifications for me appear always on top of the others, right under the quick settings.","2385":"Yup it all comes down to personal preference and what you're used to. I can see why people would prefer their notifications organized and categorized, but personally, I'd rather they just show up sorted by most recent. Easy solution would be to just add a quick toggle to have it sort by your choice. Not sure why this can't be implemented.","2386":"Chrome doesn't allow for adblocker but Samsung Internet allows for several adblockers to be downloaded and used in conjunction with the app. \n\nI'm using AdBlock plus for Samsung Internet and I find it works wonderfully.","2387":"I don't recall content blockers being available while I was using my iPhone. I also don't remember if I looked too hard for it. I'm sure there were other browsers with built in ad-block, but I was very used to Safari, and it integrated well with my Mac.","2388":"What content blockers do you use for safari?","2389":"This is an awesome reply. I'll respond to some of the things you've added:\n\nRegarding the camera, I definitely don't hate it. It has its shortcomings but I also don't expect DSLR quality photos from a smartphone camera so it definitely is adequate. My criticisms is more about the photo processing which OnePlus has indeed taken steps to improve, which is great.\n\nDisplay\/Media Consumption - I definitely agree here and actually touched on it in my review (last paragraph of the display section). Easy to miss since I pretty much wrote so much I almost hit Reddit's character limit. I also touched on the speed aspect, and pretty much agree. As a non-mobile gamer, it's pretty much as fast as I need it to be.\n\nRegarding OxygenOS updates, I faintly remember my Android 9 experience and do recall that the battery life was better. It has been a few years so I might have forgotten. Battery life on Android 10 was still manageable, but I did find myself running out every so often. And my experience with Android 11 has not been anything close to good so I'll leave it at that.\n\nNotifications seems to be a very divisive topic on both this thread and the one I cross posted on r\/OnePlus. My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be hard to just add a toggle for how you want to sort your notifications. Android being so customizable, this makes the most sense to me.\n\nAll in all, awesome reply and love the points you brought up!","2390":"Yep, notifications are personal preference as made clear by the many differing opinions here - Android just give us a toggle in settings!\n\nPhoto management system meaning the stock camera gallery app. I primarily use Google Photos now, as the way the stock app manages files seems unintuitive. \n\nI'll check out KDE, thanks for the recommendation.

That developer has a relationship to the company and the people that work there, and is invested in the long-term success of the company.\n\nIf you outsource to the other side of the world, a lot of that goes out of the window. For starters, it's incredibly hard to foster good communication with a 12h timezone difference. With that alone you lost the ability to just have a call during normal business hours when things go bad.\n\nBut that outsourcer also has no personal investment in the project. If stuff is annoying they will just jump over to the next project. And they probably won't have a deep understanding of what the project is trying to accomplish, who the users are, what they need and so on.\n\nIn many cases the use case of the project might even culturally be different. Marketing, for example, works completely different even between Austria and Germany, and there's hardy a similarity between marketing in Europe and in China.\n\nI'm sure it would be just as hard for a company from Vietnam to successfully outsource to Europe or America.\n\nAnd that's the reason why there's a huge difference between (to pick up the example from the guy before me) hireing an Indian guy in America and directly outsourcing to India.","2658":"The most important question: Did they save money? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then it does not matter, the process makes more money, and that's all a business cares about.","2659":"Even then it's still a disaster. My old job at a call centre that had an outsource centre for calls and internal tasks both performed extremely poorly, but our company took the cheapest contract bid every time as well. \n\nThe workers would change often as new outsource centres took the contract so no one had experience. A lot of my work was mopping up errors and pushing things through outsource can't or didn't do. A lot of the time it just ended up doubling the work and pissing off the customer who has to waste their time running around calls","2660":"Separate departments of these companies are constantly outsourcing around the world and after a year or two they insource again. But since these decisions usually happen on a lower level, separate parts of the company are in different stages of this.\n\nIf outsourcing to cheaper countries was without downsides, why are there still developers in Europe and USA?\n\nIf you have worked with outsourcers in different time zones who are so far away that you can't just hold in-person meetings when possible and who have no relationship to your company, products and staff, you know what the problems are and you know why global outsourcing is always just a short-term measure.","2661":"They found that shareholders liked it.","2662":"They became trillion dollar companies.

For a limited amount of time until the manager changes and the whole mess starts from the beginning.","2666":"That it's incredibly hard to successfully manage a team if the team is in another timezone, has huge fluctuations, speaks a different language and has no relationship to the company or the project.\n\nDevelopers on the other side of the world aren't worse. But running a project under these conditions is incredibly hard and it fails almost every time.\n\nIt would be similarly difficult for a company from e.g. Vietnam to successfully outsource to Europe or America.\n\nBecause of that, all these cool outsourcing projects are usually moved back to the west after 1-2 years.","2667":"Again, someone who hasn't understood what the whole thing is about but who thinks they know it all.\n\nAre you a manager by chance? It would fit.\n\nThe issue is not the quality or skill of the workers but the distance.\n\nRunning a project across the whole world is much more difficult, communication is slower, there's a much higher turnover with outsourcers and less of a relationship between the workers and the company\/product.\n\nSay you want to develop something with an in-house team. The product manager\/project owner writes a specification for a feature. Since they are not a developer and don't know the code inside out, there is a small but vital mistake in the specification (happens very frequently). The developer takes the ticket, starts working on it and finds the problem. So they quickly have a short chat with the project manager (or hop on a short call when they are in home office), sort out the problem in 10 minutes and the dev continues to work. No problem here.\n\nNow do the same thing with an external dev with 12h timezone difference. The dev runs across the problem and now there are three options: Schedule an expensive out-of-work-hours call with the project manager for the next day, send an email and risk ping-ponging back and forth for a few days or implement it based on the dev's flawed understanding of what business wants, risking an entirely wrong implementation. All this is not only losing time, but it's losing money too and you risk angering your customers, which is much, much more expensive than an inhouse dev.\n\nAdd to that that outsources generally have a much higher turn-over rate and thus much less knowledge about the business domain. And did I talk about language and culture barriers?\n\nSo of course, great software can be developed in China, by Chinese companies working with Chinese inhouse workers in the same timezone speaking the same language.\n\nBut if a Chinese company would outsource to Europe or America, they'd be in for a lot of trouble too.\n\nAll of which you would know if you ever had anything to do with outsourced work from far away.\n\nAnd again, if outsourcing to India or Asia came with no downsides, why are there still developer jobs in Europe and America?","2668":"No, we blame immigrants for all of America's problems and stealing jobs THEN proceed to use foreign labor instead of hiring within the country.\n\nSomething something China, India, Mexico bad but makes up like 70% of America's indirect workforce.","2669":"We do for H1B\u2019s","2670":"How'd your family get here?","2671":"Companies want to make money.

Then import them all as H1B's for half price of a citizen. Or less. And they are trapped, because the company holds their Visa hostage. \n\nWhere I work has a LOT of Indian contractors. Even more in India. The folks qualified to come here are generally pretty good. Some are outstanding. Still can't help but think that there are a lot of Americans getting fucked out of jobs because the imports are cheap and big tech cheats. There's a reason Leon wants all of the H1B's he can get. Modern slave labor.","2721":"Exactly my point.","2722":"Your clear implication was that quality doesn't matter, which is obviously not true.","2723":"How many tech CEOs are foreign born?","2724":"Not the only reason, but it is a significant part of the reason.","2725":"yep.. the poster above is creating a false equivalency by comparing the US (with minimal-to-no worker protections) to Europe.","2726":"Yes, and they should be pushing their countries to stick up for them!","2727":"Regardless, we are competing in global space now. Even then there are still plenty of people who is trying to move here, even illegally risking their life.","2728":"Imagine that you have rent because home prices are too high. Then imagine you lose 40% to taxes. Then imagine asking yourself why do I this to myself? I should quit this corporate hell hole.","2729":"Yes, it's full comp, salary + bonus + stock.","2730":"Yeah.. I know, I was explaining why I thought it was less than $10 million....","2731":"Haha no that was just the last phone in the RAW google experience i used before switching to samsung and probably the last good one they made.","2732":"Crazy to think I was such a diehard fan. They seemed unstoppable starting from their search onto Gmail, maps, etc. their nexus line was also ingenious (despite them being reskinned devices of other manufacturers). But randomly enough, my last straw was stadia. I had heavily bought into that ecosystem just to be spat on.\n\nAlso yes. Privacy.","2733":"See - I don't get the love for Apple. Their UI is SHIT. Utterly frustrating to use after Android. I did a few weeks on an iPhone just before the pandemic. No android at all. On my android, I just copied my media into the folders I use. iPhone? F that, you have to copy into whatever app you use. No common file system accessible to applications (though I understand this changed recently) And if you want decent apps, pay up. There is a hell of a lot of Apple tax in their entire ecosystem. While I *can* afford Apple products now, barely, I don't want to.","2734":"we all are my friend we all are.","2735":"Sorry i can't view the data from the statista link, any way you can share it a different way?","2736":"I mean, that's why good leaders tend to have background experience in the thing they're leading _alongside_ a MBA.\n\nThe MBA skillset would teach how to apply that background to the business.\n\nSolely relying on one skillset is rarely going to work save for cases where the individuals with that sole focus have good communication with one another and trust one another's expertise - just having an MBA and no background on the creation of the product a company makes can open you up to losing focus on the product for the business.\n\nThere's gotta be a balance.","2737":"It\u2019s less about the skills and more about recognizing the value of good engineers. Engineers with a penchant for management understand the value of retaining talent. But career managers, which MBA is a shorthand for, just see expensive engineers as a cost center to be reduced. It usually works for a while, until the product collapses under the weight of its unresolved tech debt, so it\u2019s seen as a success and failure blamed on something else.","2738":"Eh that's what VCs are for","2739":"bootstrap with the savings made over the years","2740":"I'll take one of them tubes. Thanks.","2741":"Yours ask for help? I find they just throw their hands up in the air. When asked if any questions, all smiles and nods and \"no no, we got it\"","2742":"This is true... but at the same time the best of those coders predominantly want to leave India to improve their own quality of life (and then their cost goes up)... you're probably better off outsourcing to less cheap but more desirable places - like central Europe (which then pulls people from eastern Europe).  Not as cheap as India, but far higher quality and more stable.  Well if not for the bloody war...","2743":"since it's before a buyout, it's a rush to make the books more palatable","2744":"There's a huge difference between a 12h timezone difference and 0-3h.\n\nYes, you lose some efficiency if you have to hop on a call vs just talking in person. But with a 12h timezone difference every little question takes a day. You can't have any back-and-forth at all unless someone goes on a call far outside of business hours.\n\nI've worked in fully-remote jobs where everyone's in Europe and I worked in a job where part of the team was in Vietnam. It's a massive difference.\n\n> In our company, it's no less different if the Dev is a FTE because of how often devs are being shuffled between projects.\n\nWell, of course you can pull the same kind of crap that outsourcing forces on you with insourcers as well. Had that e.g. when I worked at Broadcom. My team worked on 4 different huge legacy projects within a single year. We collectively did basically nothing because we spent all our time getting to know the new project before being shuffled to the next one. And yes, this style of \"work\" is ridiculously inefficient, and you can artificially force it onto insourced people, but you can hardly do anything against this when working with outsourced people.\n\nYou are comparing the worst possible kind of management for insource with the average case for outsource.\n\n> Honestly, this sounds a bit like corporate talk. If you paid your employees good and did not work them to exhaustion, I think they would want to see your company, if not their career, flourish - hence they will become more invested in the job. I'm saying this as an FTE from an outsourced branch of a US-based company.\n\nIt does sound a little like corporate talk, but it's actually true. It's a huge difference if I think \"I'm gonna be gone from that project in 2 months anyway\" or if I think \"I'm going to spend the next 7 years on this project\".\n\nIt's also a huge difference in the way you can reason about work. If I spent 3 years already on this project and I really care about it, and business comes with a crap requirement that will mess up part of the project, then I will have the knowledge, the motivation and the interpersonal security to argue against the requirement and to come up with something better.\n\nIf I'm on the project for a month and I'm expecting to work for an entirely different product from a different company in half a year's time because I'm an outsourcer and will get rotated away anyway, then I'll lack anything that would make me able to oppose the bad requirement.\n\nAnd of course, you can foster the same crappy work environment with insourced people, but again, that's crappy management (with insouced people) vs just the nature of the setup (with outsourced people)","2745":"Some H1Bs are abused.  Some are not.  I wish instead of an H1B lottery (if too many apply in a year \\[and there's always too many\\], they randomly pick who gets them) there was instead a system where the top highest paid offers are accepted instead.  You'd end up giving H1Bs to the best people and\/or the most motivated to hire them companies.\n\nThere is a vast shortage of really good software engineers - those folks that in the US make 200k+.  That shortage is \\*why\\* the salaries are 200k+.  These are the people who even with all the layoffs are going to find a new job whenever they want to.\n\nWhy is there a shortage?  Various reasons, but not enough STEM students and simply not enough talented & motivated folks is part of it...  You can teach basic programming to most folks, many can learn to be a decent programmer, but excellence also requires luck (ie. talent, mindset, and not just hard work, likely starting at an early age as well), and there's simply too few of those in the US (330 mil population vs 8 billion worldwide: there will always be more excellent folks outside).  Silicon valley has been brain draining the rest of the world for decades now... (that brain drain also makes it hard for competing centers to form elsewhere)","2746":"Only insofar that it serves their objective to make money. Hence, companies aren't asking themselves \"Why is the quality of our product decreasing\"","2747":"How many CEOs are overseas developers?","2748":"Dude companies are just greedy.  It's the issue with capitalism.  It's profits above all else.  They don't give a shit that good paying American jobs are being lost if it means the share price will continue to go up and rich shareholders continue to make money.","2749":"Might wanna correct your comment then instead of spreading misinformation \ud83d\ude1c","2750":"That to me is where the privacy comes in. I didn't used to value it but now i prefer to pay the apple tax moving forward over the google exploitation","2751":"Didn't Google Chat replace it? What changed between Hangouts and Google Chat?","2752":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/y0c59rdbndge1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3d7f79053c4e3070e2c4cef19fffea6df7284f","2753":"Nailed it. How this is lost on so many companies is mind boggling.\n\nI'm convinced you have insecure MBAs thinking they're smarter than all the code monkeys... who in my experience know exactly how valuable they are, which is why they left when they saw the shit crumbling.","2754":"But those are management skills you're describing, you're just outlining a difference between good management and short termism. Good MBAs focus on teaching effective business management, not pumping quarterly numbers.","2755":"But they ARE CHEAPER!!!!","2756":"Interesting. Our devs here really don't stay long with one project. I guess that's how it is in the west where there is ownership of a project compared to here where you get reassigned to a new one once your job is done or you're needed elsewhere. I find the culture here annoying tbh because there's been instances where I need a resource person for a project and discover that they're no longer associated with the resource I'm working on and they don't know who took over.","2757":"Yes, companies can not operate without money and they do not build phones as a charity.  So profound.","2758":"You might be surprised to know developers can be CEOs. Most of them start as engineers.","2759":"well not just companies, I'm greedy too. I don't give a shit about my boss or my company, as long as they give me good pay and I would jump ship to different company if they pay me more. \nI'm also invest my retirement money in stocks so if the share price go up, I'm benefiting too.","2760":"It's not misinformation, 2020-2022 he mad less than 10 million per year, he got $220m (ish) in stock for 2023. His ***normal*** compensation is under 10 million.","2761":"People are capable of reading","2762":"Thanks tbh it doesn't look that bad since Google didn't seem to serious on Pixel until the 6th gen, which is when they start to appear on the graph. Though for company its size it def could be better\n\nLet's hope your prediction is wrong, we need competition","2763":"And that's all the companies worry about.","2764":"I can't speak for every company, afaik US companies also shuffle devs around quite a lot. But here in Central Europe at least it's quite common that devs spend their whole time in a company on a single project. So on an average team you'll likely have 1-2 people who have been on the project for 5+ years and the rest will be on average at about 3 years.\n\nSame with management.\n\nThat does some very nice effects, so e.g. if a customer wants to know something or wants a new feature, usually the project manager will already know enough about the project so that they can say whether its feasible and if not, then the team will know everything needed.\n\nCompared to a team that gets reassigned a lot, where the product manager knows nothing, has to ask the team and the team also knows nothing and first has to reverse-engineer to code to figure out what the customer even wants.","2765":"I was directly responding to someone who stated otherwise but if being smug about nothing makes you feel better then by all means.","2766":"Good thing we have developers in the US then!\n\n(Even though most CEOs *don't* start as developers)","2767":"That's not true. \n\nIn 2023 he ***sold*** $220 million of the stock he owned, but he didn't necessarily get it all that year.\n\nHe was earning those (and likely much more) stocks throughout all the years he's been at Google.","2768":"but, Pixel isn't 2nd, and it's always been half (or less) what Motorola sold. why on earth did they sell Motorola. It makes no sense..","2769":"Most Tech CEOs did start as developers lmao","2770":">2020-2022\n\n>In 2023\n\nBruh, read.\n\n>he ***sold*** $220 million of the stock he owned\n\nThat is actually false, he was given $220m in stock awards for 2023, previous years he just got his $2m salary + $6.8m security.","2771":"Lol let's look at the largest tech companies:\n\n1. Apple - Tim Cook, started in Supply Chain Management \u274c\n\n2. Nvidia - Jensen Huang, Founder \u274c\n\n3. Microsoft - Satya Nadella, while he had an MBA he did start as a developer \u2705\n\n4.

Netflix - Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, both started in business development \u274c\u274c\n\n10. Salesforce - Marc Benioff, Founder \u274c \n\n\n\nI'm sure you're picturing Nadella (or maybe Pichai incorrectly) when you make your claim, but he's clearly an outlier. Furthermore, to suggest such talent can only be found outside the US is laughable, considering the number of Americans in this list lol","2772":"Jensen is a hardware engineer lmao he started as a CEO because he founded the company but he worked initially as a hardware developer when the company got founded\n\nalso\n\n\\>\\*\\*:\\*\\*\u00a0Jensen Huang is an electrical engineer and has for long been directly involved in the design and manufacturing of computer chips.

Even a new battery couldn\u2019t save the 6S once the iOS got high enough. But it\u2019s my experience that there have been improvements from the XR and onwards. Actual full day usage is possible, though I may be on the more heavy side with games, media and all that. \n\nThat said\u2026I also find it a bit disingenuous that you consider hotspot usage to be medium load, and claim iPhones have worse battery life.","2775":"Phenomenal writeup.\n\nA lot of this goes against the usual narrative.","2776":"Tremendous writeup, saved for if I ever go iOS. Most of us just zero in on one phone every two or three years; this gives perspective on the S-series and iPhone that would be impossible for the rest of us to amass.\n\nAndroid was first to 4G too. In 2011, there were three LTE phones offered by my provider, but the iPhone was still 3G. The main reason I went Android. \n\nAndroid was much better for swiping keyboards, up until maybe now.\n\nHearing aids in general work better with iPhones, for providing phone calls and media directly to the aids.\n\nThanks for all those experiential summaries!","2777":"Man, you are every companies' dream customer.","2778":"Yes but which one can summarise the post in 2 lines","2779":"In and out baby","2780":"Either lint buildup or just rough ridin\u2019- I imagine we hear less about the lightning ports since wireless charging was added as I almost never plug in my phone unless I need a quick bump charge.","2781":"In fact, the HTC Evo 4G was the first 4G phone and I believe the HTC Thunderbolt was the first phone enabled with LTE.

I can understand how people don't \"get\" how to use it, because it doesn't make it obvious or even very easy. The trick is to \"thumbs up\" a song you like, then \"Start radio\" from that song. Thumbs-up any songs you like from that list, and then make a radio station from one of those songs, and so on. \n\nLately I've been big into J-pop and J-rock, with artists I never would have discovered on my own.

I'm not even sure if it ever used to work well to be honest. I think it works for uploading 1 track a day at best, so borderline broken.\n\nGPM also has 3rd party functionality with GPMDP, great app that makes the UI nicer.

THe fact that the picture of the current song in the top left corner is the \"up one level\" button is the kind of mystery-meat navigation that should've been left in the '90s.\n\nIts ID3 reconciling behavior is pitiful - I've got double-albums where it's confusingly intertwingled both, or properly tagged albums that end up in \"unknown artist\".","3005":"[deleted]","3006":"God all I want from GPM at this point is smart playlists. Is that too much to fucking ask? ITunes has that shit like 15 years ago ","3007":"Agreed. Very frustrating.

Things like that.","3029":"Well, you see, google doesn't actually have any people USE the app after they make it. They just toss it into the play store and laugh at frustrated users.","3030":"Spotify my man","3031":"Seems like this is over triggering. Clearly they need to fix the swipe so it requires a more deliberate trigger.\n\nThis is an awesome feature that I've *wished* Spotify had for years. It would speed things up tremendously.","3032":"This is a dumb question, but seeing how it relates to the topic at hand, I'm assuming there is no way to save a \"I'm feeling lucky\" mix, other than to thumb up the songs you like and hope you hear them more?","3033":"Honestly, it's such an annoying feature. ","3034":"Cool now that I know about this issue it's gonna start happening THANKS","3035":"It's impressive how music apps with horrible UIs continue existing today. It's a basic feature tons of people use, one would imagine that it would be one of the first features to improved to perfection. But in reality it's like the developers don't even try using their own apps.  \n\nBack in the day, Windows Phone had a great music app, and it just worked flawlessly, fast and with a beautiful UI and then Microsoft killed it. Eventually I moved to Android, and it's so frustrating that most of the apps I use on Android have such a half-baked UI. It's a clusterfuck of horrible colors, confusing UIs, and inconvenient shortcuts like the OP mentioned.","3036":"Has anybody figured out why GPM is such a battery hog? Whenever I use it, my battery will drop 15-20% after a few songs. I don't have this issue with any other apps.","3037":"I have a similar problem in the Sync for Reddit app. You can swipe to Hide and I do it accidentally way too often. It's only been since I got my Pixel 2 XL.

Delete a post. Usually I get to the undo button but sometimes it's just not possible.","3041":"I ditched GPM for CloudPlayer after I hit the completely arbitrary 1000 song per playlist limit. And yet, instead of fixing that nonsense, they add this \"feature\"?\n\nIt seems to me that Google doesn't care about the local playlist aspect of GPM, they only want you to listen to their crappy \"Radio Stations\". Very disappointed because I want GPM to be successful, but they just keep making it worse. ","3042":"What's more annoying is not being able to view all your artists as a list. I have 20k+ songs I don't want to scroll through a million bloody images. I use Plex now. ","3043":"Is this new behavior? This never happened to me on Android when using it ","3044":"So many complains about the UI in this thread. Surely it can't be as bad as Apple Music. Surely.","3045":"Hell, Apple's Android version of Apple Music is miles better than Play Music, even in terms of UI and it's not even Material Design.","3046":"I use Samsung music for all of my music. I just cannot stand google play music. ","3047":"it\u2019s as annoying as spotify\u2019s \u201cBehind the Lyrics\u201d.

I wouldn't even bother me much to give up Spotify, but the GPM experience (dekstop and web too) is just so.. infuriating.  \nIt's an afterthought to Google, they have to offer a music service because the competition offers it.  \nFor Spotify its a central business - so it will always be better with Spotify - and if you go to the Spotify forums or sub you'll know just how much people are infuriated by Spotify - GPM is just that mcuh worse.","3049":"It has the same functionality with archiving in the GMail app and I hate it there too. I don't even know what my archive is or how to access it from the mobile app, and it doesn't seem to change the PC experience if I do archive something.","3050":"I really hope they fix this as well.

","3052":"Other complaints: I listen to a bunch of different music, but the instant I listen to 1 kanye song all of a sudden you suggest shitloads of kanye. fuck kanye. ","3053":"These combined make this app unusable to me. I have been using YouTube music with a Red subscription. Hand down the best music streaming app I've seen. And it helps me when I just don't want to make a playlist, I can just pick a song and it'll create one for me. While most music apps do this, this one works for better in my experience.

Also, I hugely miss being able to add a song to the *end* of the queue. I don't even think it looks that bad, I love seeing all the big artwork and stuff.\n\nPlay Music with YouTube Red is actually a really good deal. If Google upgraded their music discovery experience like Spotify, and improved the Web app to not be hot garbage, I would change back in an instance.","3061":"still better than itunes","3062":"I don't know why apps are so obsessed with swiping on *everything*. \n\nThis is also a problem in Gmail. When I try to switch accounts I just swipe to archive an email instead of going to the pullout menu.","3063":"I live in the woods and have no service for most of my commute.

The worst app ever and I have used it for 1.5 years","3065":"Wow I've been driving myself up the wall for two weeks, I thought it was user error the whole time. I've deleted so many songs without noticing. ","3066":"Since Rdio died it's sadly the best option","3067":"Not related to Play Music, but I can't stand how easy it is to remove saved songs from My Music in Spotify.\n\nI wish they would add a confirmation dialog. Even if not by default, they should allow the option to enable the confirmation dialog...

I'm also experiencing this issue , but I've had this issue for the last two weeks or so. I'm kind of glad others are having the same issue so it can gain some traction on Google's bug fix end, and I hope its fixed soon. I can count at least 10 songs that were deleted from my playlists that way.","3069":"Question: are you left handed? Its possible that the arc that you make with your thumb looks more like a swipe when you are doing it with the other thumb.","3070":"Glad to hear I'm not the only one with this issue.\n\nIt's the worst when I'm listening to an album that I'm not too familiar with, and I accidentally swipe a song out of the album playlist. I mean, how am I supposed to know where it goes, and if I don't press the \"Undo\" button in time?\n\nAnyway, I hope Google changes the touch sensitivity of GPM soon.","3071":"Wtf!! Thanks for the update! I will be careful now!\nAnd btw, even I found some features pretty lame! Take the equalizer for example....It is one of the shittiest equalizers in a music app ever! The Google Play Music's equalizer doesn't do much than muffle the volume!\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude21\nIn fact, I thought my earphones had stopped working when i first experimented with those settings \ud83d\ude02","3072":"I have to say, I hate swipe gestures in general.  I feel like half the time I do them, they don't work.  Either I don't swipe far enough so it doesn't finish, or I swipe at a bad angle so it doesn't work.","3073":"I just need some god damn playlists that are longer than 1000 songs. It's driving me crazy. ","3074":"Same thing goes for google's email app, very anoying indeed!","3075":"Super annoying. Probably going to move back to Spotify because of the garbage UI","3076":"In what way is Play Music not aesthetically pleasing or not user friendly?","3077":"The WORST offender in this respect is the Fidelity Investments app. It has a portfolio view that shows you, for example, the funds in your 401k. If you try to scroll sideways to see the current value (why is that not the first column?!) it interprets micro-movements up and down as scrolling and re-loads the entire screen... slowly.

Play Music on iOS works perfectly fine...","3086":"TIL I'm the only one that had never accidentally done this.\n\nI honestly just opened the app and TRIED to accidentally do this. I can't manage it. I can drag damn near sideways in a diagonal up or down and it still scrolls instead of deletes. I have to make a very deliberate swipe on a single song for it to swiped away.\n\nI feel like I'm using a totally different app than the one everyone is talking about here. ","3087":"I hate Google Play Music. It's been unusable for me several times, especially when trying to upload my library. Switched to CloudPlayer and it's so much better. I can keep my music in my Drive and use the app on both my phone and Chromebook.","3088":"They need to take a hint from Relay for Reddit. Slide to the left reveals a menu.

","3092":"I just want mine to stop crashing.","3093":"How a UX designer can think removing a song from a playlist is so common that it needs such a common shortcut is beyond me.\n\nClearly the person on it previous used Inbox and realised that you swipe to the side to remove, and didn't decide to use their brain when applying it to another project.\n\nNot that it matters. Seems Google have entirely lost interest with Play anyway. I moved back to Spotify where it isn't just a tiny part of a bigger business.","3094":"Instagram has the worst ghost swiping","3095":"I keep doing this accidentaly in my Gmail app. ","3096":"I\ufe0f delete important emails this exact same way unfortunately ","3097":"I have this issue a lot when I'm using Snapchat at the same time as Google Play.  When you unlock your phone to Snapchat it opens to the camera and you swipe right to go to your Snaps.  I do that instinctually and if Snapchat doesn't open and I'm in Google play, i end up deleting a song very quickly and have no idea which one I did.  It sucks tbh.","3098":"If I'm listening to a playlist and accidentally swipe it out, does that remove it from the playlist itself, or just the queue of what's about to play?","3099":"I agree. If you have a large playlist and scroll to a song torwards the bottom you are going to remove a song guaranteed. This annoys me a lot about google music. That and sometimes a song will just cut off and start on the next one every once in a while. Otherwise i love the service.","3100":"I have been doing this exact same thing. Everyone file a feedback report. ","3101":"Same here its Fuckin irritating","3102":"just done it loads tonight (\u2022_\u2022)","3103":"I wholeheartedly agree. This is one of many things that makes the Google Music app downright infuriating to use. Don't even get me started with Android Auto.\n\nIf there's another Android Auto compatible player that'll allow me to upload my iTunes library while preserving playlists for free, I wouldn't hesitate to move.","3104":"Funnily enough just now while trying to upvote a comment here on Relay I actually found it a little difficult to swipe over.","3105":"Yep, I've done this without realizing I had and been like 'Wait, where's that one song?'. I switched to Tidal recently, which isn't perfect, but I  do not miss the Play app one bit.","3106":"Got to agree. It's way too sensitive.","3107":"Scroll by putting your finger on the right edge of the list where the ... is.

Stop changing things that aren't broken.","3118":"So I'm not the only one to be annoyed but this, good to know.","3119":"Get your shit together GPM team!","3120":"Yes..there should NEVER be swipe to delete. So stupid","3121":"Confirmed here also on my Pixel 2, Android 8.1 and latest play music.","3122":"This is one of 3 reasons I switched back to Spotify","3123":"Just needs a confirmation of some kind, maybe a small button appears after swiping on that song specifically to confirm? We need an undo history as well, it would be awesome if it could be implemented into android itself, maybe through play services since Google already does undo in a lot of their apps.","3124":"I just don't use it anymore. I hate that when I add a song its not the version that I want to listen too. Sometimes it's a completely different song and no amount of re-uploading the correct one seems to fix it. \n\nThe app just sent me into a rage all the time so now I just stream with Amazon Music or listen to my iPod which also at times upsets me. I just need a great music app that is simple and just works.","3125":"I thought i was the only one annoyed about this. Glad its getting attention","3126":"I thought I was the only one! Fucking fix this, Google!","3127":"If only there was another app out there that did the same fucking thing but better. ","3128":"what version of Play Music is this?

It's not the same. I miss Songza. Or 8tracks before they put a limit on listening time. I've been a member since the month they started and yet I was still expected to pay for a premium account.

It was actually a positive game changer for me, honestly, though there are still many other shortcomings.","3138":"It is really freaking annoying. I've been a paid subscriber since the app was first released, and I usually just use my Thumbs Up playlist. Thankfully you can't delete songs like this in that one. I think that's one of the reasons I gravitate towards only that. I know it's not ideal, but it does avoid this issue altogether. Sure, you have to have all your music lumped together, but it's worth it to me.\n\nOver the years, it really does seem like Google puts minimal effort into making this app user friendly at all. I keep thinking that they will do a major overhaul soon, but the day never comes. With that said, I still pay a lot of money to Google (music, extra storage, phones, and other devices) so I guess I'm not that upset with them about it. At least not upset enough to boycott them.","3139":"Google Music actually used to work well for me...but something changed about a month or two ago.   Now it's slow and laggy as hell and I'm considering switching to Spotify!","3140":"100% agree. I was wondering why my favorite tracks kept getting removed from my playlist. This is total BS, and I can't believe a developer like Google could have something like this pass through testing.

But man it is sluggish on Android, even the Pixel 2 XL. On iOS devices, it\u2019s super smooth and fluid, it just flies. Either way, it does need a complete overhaul to bring it in line with Apple Music and Spotify. The only thing holding me back from switching is it comes with YT Red, I can upload 150,000 songs w\/o DRM, and I\u2019m already in a family plan w\/ friends (comes out to $2.50\/person which is very cheap).","3178":"Holy fuck goddamn this is annoying.

I wish there was a sort of deleted song button on every playlist so you could go to it if you delete a song on accident. My big complaint with play is lack of a discovery tab or browse section and the new release section doesn't add much. I wish Spotify did at least have the ability to move songs around in your playlists, though there's a wired glitch sometimes in play when if you move a song to fast in a playlist in play the song will jump back to it's original spot on the playlist once you leave and return to the playlist. Also I hate how when you remove a album it typically removes any song you might have in that album from playlists. ","3184":"Yeah, this has been especially bad lately - it's definitely gotten worse.

You can \"Play Next\" or \"Add to Queue\", while Spotify only has \"Play Next\" (which is confusingly labelled \"Add to Queue\").

","3231":"[deleted]","3232":"It's not *that bad*, but the only reason I use it over Spotify is because I can upload stuff that isn't in their library.\n\nIt isn't true that there's no music discovery, but the feature itself is very unintuitive. If you OK Google a track or artist, it'll play what you requested and then other stuff like it. Or you can click the context menu on a track and 'Start Radio', which of course makes no sense to a new user.\n\nOther big issues with GPM: I'm currently using an old version because since June, every track skips and repeats the first second on Bluetooth. And you also can't just OK Google your own library: if you ask it to play music on Shuffle it'll pick something from your library, and then a load of 'similar' tracks you don't own. It's a real mess.","3233":"Google Play Music is the slowest app on my phone. It takes an age to start up, scrolling is laggy, switching between screens is laggy.

I'm never really sure \"where\" I am in the app, pressing the back button has roughly 87 results, which seem to vary according to the weather and current astrological alignment. There's the home page, the recents tab, and current song all crammed into the \"home screen\" of the app. Navigating anywhere is a nightmare... and despite having a flagship device, it is still one of the buggiest, slow apps on my phone.

I want to switch to them so badly for the HiFi but I just don't know if I can justify it when it's so frustrating to use.\n\n* For starters, every once in a while, the next\/previous song buttons stop working, along with the queue. Yep, you literally need to force close the app and make a new queue to get the ability to change songs working again.\n\n* The \"create a radio station based on this track\/artist\" button does nothing. You can click the button, but nothing happens.\n\n* The app is always running in the background - every time I close the app, I need to hit the \"x\" in the notification to make it go away. Closing the app doesn't work. Swiping the notification away doesn't even work because it comes back in 5 minutes.\n\n* Occasionally it forgets it's Chromecasting and I need to disconnect and reconnect\n\n* You can't sort playlists in a custom order. Only by alphabetical or by date added. I have approx 45 large playlists so this is inexcusable\n\n...I wish Spotify would just get HiFi already","3273":"Open source desktop player?

That's the only exception I can think of though.","3277":"> the Google app hasn't changed much\n\nYes it has. For the worse. It used to have relevant information personal to you. Stuff gleamed from your Gmail (flights and deliveries, for example), from your location (currency exchange and common phrase translations), etc. You also used to be able to swipe away news articles you didn't want. And the news was quite well tailored to your interests. Now, a much larger portion of the news is stuff there only because it's \"trending\" (i.e., popular in general, but not really related to what you care about). Getting rid of news articles is much harder. And the personalised information is hidden behind an easy-to-forget-about second screen.","3278":"I'd be completely ok with all the design as long as they add a Amoled black theme option","3279":"Speaking of Google app, is it just me or are ALL new google apps icons (play music, play book, play store, gmail bla bla) hideous as shit? \n\nThe white empty background looks like the icon is not displayed in full screen.

The free server storage for your personal collection is great...it finally allowed me to delete iTunes from all my machines and my life (I had foolishly converted everything to the apple codec years ago).\n\nI used Spotify for a while before I went with GPM, and I find GPM's artist\/song radio selections to be way closer to what I'm looking for than Spotify's respective service. I don't know what the specific algorithmic differences are, but I think that GPM uses other user's data and preferences more heavily than the music's attributes.","3298":"Sad thing is that Youtube Red is only available in select countries. I'm paying for a subscription but I still see ads and can't background Youtube videos.","3299":"Same here. I'd probably have switched to Spotify but the 7.99 intro price and ad-free YouTube makes it worthwhile to keep and just deal with the blah UI.","3300":"You don't get YouTube Red in 99% of countries.

I have the same problem with Amazon Music. It freezes and crashes constantly. Google Play Music, on the other hand, works fine.","3313":"Former Spotify user converted to Google play user here. Spotify has amazing discovery functions that are actually very interactive and fun to use. Google play music has stale, mediocre discovery in comparison","3314":"I find it to be the exact opposite.

","3322":"I agree wholeheartedly. As soon as Google play music offered the upload and storage, I ditched my iTunes and iPod completely. Having everything in one device is more important to me. But the current music model is geared towards discovery, subscriptions $$$ and that means no list-view which is understandable but unfortunate. List view should at the very least be a premium feature for those of us who already pay.\n\niTunes is STILL a better interface and user experience in my opinion.","3323":"Never used *any* music streaming service, just *YouTub*ed a song, downloaded it, done.\n\nEdit: As OP mentions, the **Song is removed while scrolling down in the Playlist view**. Nothing about Streaming is mentioned here. So my point is still valid.","3324":"Exactly, that was another thing for me. I used to use voice commands while driving with GPM and it would work perfectly, but then one day every command would always load a radio station, and switch \"Downloaded Only\" off even if you had it on.

I've tried GPM for three months and I was so let down I was tempted to resume my Spotify Premium subscription early on, I only waited until the end s the trial to save some cash. But I'm not doing that again.\n\nActually, many times the website was so slow (back then I used Chrome so inexcusable) I just preferred dealing with the annoyances of Spotify Free on the desktop over having that website slow my machine down to a crawl.\n\nWhat joke GPM is. It needs A LOT of time in the oven.","3335":"Spotify is half the price and I get Hulu with it, but I just can't go back to regular YouTube","3336":"I use a xda post that has youtube with a dark theme and no ads with background playback... basically youtube red for free, i also use adblock on my pc...","3337":"Amazon music app is great!","3338":"I like Spotify\u2019s app a lot more but they seem to have a lot of variation in the quality of their tracks. GPM is guaranteed 320kbps mp3 every time, and they have a bigger library.\n\nPlus, try out Spotify\u2019s radio function. Sucks major ass. Not much better than just putting your playlist on shuffle.","3339":"That's a little cynical. And wrong. There are enough shithouse UI's out there that the world's supply of UX guru's could be kept busy indefinitely. \n\nThe problem is that UX has been relegated to a \"Nice to have\" status in most projects. I'm a web dev, and far too often I raise a concern about how hard a user will find one of our interfaces to use, but the powers that be have decided that the feature set can't be reduced, so they compromise on UX.\n\nIt seems this was the case with most of problems with GPM's mobile app. The web interface is fine. It's why I use the website to manage everything on my account. Infact, by using Google Home, Android Auto, Android Wear, and Chrome on my Desktop, I rarely use the GPM app at all...","3340":"At the cost of the consumer experience? Pretty sad if you ask me, if that's true. ","3341":"Like a lot of other ppl here have been saying, once you gain the ability to stream music, upload your own music, decent radio functionality, along with no ads on youtube and YouTube music, and add 5 friends or family for only one price, it's very difficult to go back. \nThe layout and UI of the app is one of the very few gripes I have with GPM atm. ","3342":"Apple music is garbage with bluetooth, as someone who has it. Songs ending 1-5 seconds earlier because the app's \"timer\" isn't synced properly.","3343":"My God Yes! Holy crap.\n\nApple Music on iOS is just \"meh\", but Apple Music on Android is horrible. I mean, eye gouging-ly bad. It is, literally one of the worst \"professional\" Android apps I've ever had the displeasure of using.\n\nI tried using it, and I tried liking it, but it was so buggy and poorly implemented that I don't even bother installing it on Android anymore, and I'm paying monthly for an Apple Music family plan so my kids can use it on iOS.\n\nStay away. Stay far away...","3344":"Spotify has 320kbps though. The difference between a 320kbps mp3 and a FLAC file isn't that noticeable unless you have professional studio speakers and even then it isn't that much.","3345":"He's probably referring to this: https:\/\/www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com\/\n\nIt's not Google but it is great and very customizable :)","3346":"Maps, Translate, Camera, Drive, Gmail, Inbox","3347":"It's OK.

Can't use it unless I want to wait a literal 5 minutes.","3349":"I like it for many reasons, but here are some complaints :\n\n* zooming is finicky and having to reset the zoom distance before you can swipe makes navigating a bit annoying.\n\n*  It's good for photos taken with the camera, but as an overall photo\/media library, it's pretty bare. I loved QuickPic but avoided it after they were bought out. \n\nAnd as for Google apps, they're so minimal it makes it difficult for people who like the customization of Android. Barely any theme customization is one of my bigger gripes. They've been pushing amoled devices and yet all the apps are all bright white. Sometimes there's a night\/dark theme but no Amoled black.","3350":"I have my share of hate against google photos.\nIts a mess of garbage if i am not using the backup and sync in ON. \n\nCant make out which is from device, which was backed up\n","3351":"Oh yeah, it is fucking brutal.  The worst is you get an article about someone or something you have zero interest in and tell the app you don't want stories about X anymore.  Then a little while later you get the same exact story but under some other \"trending\" topic.  So you tell it you are not interested in that topic either.  THEN, it shows you it again but this time under the name of the site it was posted on.  Your only option then is to block that site, which sucks if you like articles from that site other times.  You are basically forced to bend-over and take their trending story.\n\nIt is madness.  It just shows you articles\/trending topics from sources I am sure are being paid for (which explains taking away the ability to swipe cards away), rather than anything you have an interest in.  Even when it does show you something you are interested in, it does so from the most clickbaity source it can find and then shows you 50 versions of the same story from different sites rehosting the article for day and days.  \n\nIf I could find a better app for bathroom reading, I would delete the google app so fast... Oh, wait, you can't delete it anymore.  You can disable it, but then half your shit stops working.

GPM has the widest variety of music I've seen in a single service, where I can go from playing real up and coming Death Metal to both old and new smooth jazz to just about every genre of EDM (except hardstyle, which I made a post about over a year ago and it's still not on there). And if there's something I can't find? Well, it includes YouTube Red which allows you to not only play videos without ads, but play it in the background, even in the car with the phone locked.

Oh you're trying to see what you deleted by going into the play music history? Nope. Welp then you better have memorized YOUR ENTIRE PLAYLIST","3364":"I agree. The ad free YouTube sort of does it for me. Can't stand watching ads before a video. ","3365":"I actually just made the switch to Spotify a month ago and although I lost a library of a few thousand songs that I still haven't put back together just yet, it's unbelievable. As someone who consumes all their video content through YouTube, the lack of ads was a huge reason for me to continue to put up with Google Play music. However, Spotify for Students includes Hulu all for 5 bucks a month as opposed to the 10 or 15 for Google Play, so I was sold instantly. A better experience for a lower price than a huge competitor like Google shows that Spotify cares about their users (particularly poor college kids) and is willing to risk a possible downturn in their overall profits which is awesome.","3366":"How do you get it for 7.99?","3367":"United States? I got Red with my subscription. ","3368":"Introductory pricing. When they first started selling the subscription, it was $7.99 month. You keep the pricing for as long as you're subscribed.","3369":"\/u\/imsosohappy nailed it. Intro price and grandfathered in. Other good ideas are family plan and share it with friends.

Google Play Music knows about that folder and any time I add a file there or in one of its sub-directories it automatically uploads the track to my GPM library making it accessible to me from any device anywhere in the world as long as I have an internet connection to log into my Google account. You can upload 50,000 songs, so I can have a big harddrive full of music\/audio books\/podcasts GPM doesn't have just sitting at home but still access it all from my phone.","3376":"Which is the jankiest UX ever... ","3377":"[deleted]","3378":"I've found very few albums on Amazon that I can't get on GPM. But the few I have downloaded with Amazon's app we're easy enough download but infuriating to play back. The app just likes to open on it's own for no damn good reason. It does not always remember where you were on your track and when you tell it to start the album over it then decides to only start from the song you last left off on. This is all after they released an update for better playback control and then they won't stop bugging me to pay for their streaming service. I just upload those albums to GPM and the frustration has ended. Sure GPM isn't perfect but damn it isn't that bad either.","3379":"How so? I found GPM music auto playlist to be far superior to anything Spotify had to offer. Spotify will filter songs based by how many times you have listened to it.

They also now have discover weekly and daily mix, both awesome","3403":"It's almost like we live by the 80\/20 rule, and UX is firmly in the 20 feature set that's expendable.","3404":"But GPM is absurdly light on features too. It's shitty UI is a result of indifference and neglect by Google, not complexity due to excessive features.","3405":"I have a hifi stereo system, speakers, and headphones. Most of my friends don't have this stuff and they can't tell the difference unless they listen on my gear. I had a friend recently who didn't believe me at all, but then he sat down and listened with me and was super surprised. Almost immediately took back all of the hate he was giving me lol.\n\nWith a good enough system, you can usually tell pretty quickly if a song is lossless or not. It does depend on the mastering though.\n\nSome of the more obvious differences are in clarity of the high pitched sounds - when a singer has a hard \"s\" or \"t\", it has more bite to it. It sounds more like real speech. Or you can hear the instruments' harmonics more clearly if you're consciously listening for it. Another big difference is in channel separation. For example, a song with 4 or 5 people singing at once (The Eagles for example), you can much more clearly tell the voices apart.\n\nNow, I say this as someone who's crazy passionate about music. I'd say it compares to the kind of person who loves movies, so they buy a super high-end 4k HDR TV. For most people, it's overkill. A normal TV is fine. But for someone who loves movies, they'll go off about how much darker the blacks are, how the colors are so much better. They need to get special movies that support all of those features if they really want to make use of them.\n\nIf you've ever seen really nice new HDR TV, they're pretty great, but it doesn't really matter *that much* to most people. Same with music and a good HiFi system. It does make a pretty significant difference, but unless you really care about audio, it won't matter that much to you.\n\n320kbps on Spotify is pretty good, but it's a definite step down compared to lossless.","3406":"[deleted]","3407":"[deleted]","3408":"Maps has been the bane of my travels for the last few months.\n\n\"OK Google, give me directions to McDonalds\"\n\nFirst four results are 15+ minutes away, scrolling dwon reveals one 3 minutes away.\n\nThe distance measurement isn't half accurate.

To be honest, I found it's radio function *slightly* better than Spotify. And the ability to add music from your personal library, that would otherwise be unavailable, is nice.
