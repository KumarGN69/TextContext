paired with the pixel phone, which would you prefer?","1":"Do you think you could wear these on a run or jog \/ at the gym without them falling out? That's been my main concern when I see their size.","2":"Is your scale relative to APP or absolute?","3":"Great writeup! \n\nThis is the kind of user feedback I look for when considering a purchase, and your comments both give me hope for the future of the line, and pause considering the high treble in videos (the bulk of my content consumption over my earbuds).\n\nThanks and keep up the great work!","4":"How are they with phone calls, can ppl hear you clearly, can you hear ppl clearly?\n\nWith background noise how is it talking and hearing someone","5":"Can you compare ANC between WF XM4?","6":"Thanks for posting this. As the owner of a pair of AirPod Pros, Pixel Buds A Series, and soon to be Pixel Buds Pros, this was very relevant to me. \n\nOutside of my APP's having ANC, Transparency, and wireless charging, I actually prefer the comfort and sound quality of the A Series, plus they work much more reliably on my Pixel than my AirPods do, which often need to be put back in the case once or twice to get both AirPods to connect to my Pixel. I could never quite get the fit perfect either, despite trying all ear tips. They have fallen out multiple times while walking or eating, but that hasn't really happened to me with the A Series.\n\nAs such, I'm very excited to have comparable features and better battery life in the Pixel Buds Pros! Hopefully they can improve the transparency a bit, but I'm not too surprised to hear that they aren't as good as the APP's, just because it's crazy good on those. I care more about the ANC anyways, so it is very promising to hear that the Buds Pros have the edge there over the APP.\n\nI will still use my AirPods with my iPad and work iPhone, so now I will have a nice set of ANC earbuds dedicated to both platforms that I use. That should be pretty nice.","7":"I'm jealous. Mines are at a UPS facility 30 minutes away from me, but I have to wait until Monday...\n\nEdit: typos","8":"What about that adjusting pressure feature (sensors that are capable of adjusting the pressure in the ear canal). Does it feel the same as the airpods pro?","9":"Can I see cat photos?","10":"How are the magnets that hold the buds in the case?\n\nOn my Pixel Buds 2 the magnets are super strong and if you get the buds near it they fall into place no matter their orientation \n\nOn the gf's A Series, the magnets are much weaker and I've noticed you have to line it up pretty well when putting the buds in the case","11":"How are they for audio sync when watching a video, on a phone and on a PC?\n\nDo you think you could sleep with them in your ears and your head on a pillow (on an airplane)?    \n\nMy main issues with APPs are connecting to a Pixel and volume controls.  Also battery life could be better.  I could live with somewhat worse audio quality if comfort and ANC were no worse and the other issues were better (although comfort can be a very individual thing).  Would you recommend the PBP?","12":"Appreciate this Review 100%\n\nHave used the Pixel Buds Gen 1, Pixel Buds Gen 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 2, and have been eyeing the Pixel Buds Pro since the announcement. \n\nExcited to snag some now!","13":"Can anyone hear you when you're wearing them? Cause the a series everyone hears what I'm hearing and so annoying... Especially, I'm blasting The Wicked End by Avenged Sevenfold. Thanks","14":"Do they stick out further than the regular Pixel Buds 2 \/ A-series? One of my favorite features of the buds is how they fit kind of flush, so you can wear them under a helmet.","15":"Do you have Chromecast with Google TV? If yes, could you please test sync issues on YouTube? Please try multiple videos because for some it may work fine (as did Buds 2) but not for others (as Buds 2 didn't) depending on the encoding.","16":"The magnetic lock looks legit, and loving the small pod size.","17":"How's the battery life?","18":"Perhaps I missed this somewhere or I\u2019m ignorant of the specs that would allow it, but do you know if these would allow the Dolby atmos feature on Apple Music?","19":"hows the connectivity?  I know some folks have reported prior edition buds having extremely spotty connectivity.","20":"Nice LTT deskpad \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","21":"Solid review","22":"Do they charge wirelessly? I wish the buds series A did.","23":"Stems. The most overlooked aspect of wireless earbuds. They should all have stems lol Going from AAP to Galaxy buds 2 has been hard. I can't even touch my earbuds without pausing or skipping a song. And I don't want to turn those gestures\/touches off because they are useful when you need them. But so annoying when you just want to adjust your earbud. Eager to test out the PBPs tonight","24":"[deleted]","25":"So ANC isn't significantly better and transparency mode doesn't compare to a nearly 3 year old Airpods Pro? That's unfortunate.","26":"I give them 3 months at best. That's twice as long as mine worked. Google will screw you out of any replacement or repairs too. Sad how much they've changed in recent years","27":"Is the case waterproof\/resistant?","28":"Re: audio quality\n\nIf they're anything like the other Pixel Buds you can adjust the EQ to increase the bass. It's not perfect but it helps. On my Pixel 6 Pro it's under Settings > Connected Devices > gear icon next to Pixel Buds > Sound\n\nI personally also use a third party EQ app made for Bluetooth to really dial in a better EQ with my Pixel Buds A-Series:\n\nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=io.audiosmaxs.bassboostermusic\n\nIt sucks that you have to do any of this, especially with more expensive earbuds, they should come with a good dialed in EQ setting, but there are some things you can do to make the audio quality better.","29":"Great review! Thanks for posting.","30":"How about audio sync with netflix? Prime video?","31":"I don\u2019t get what you mean by AirPods Pro don\u2019t play nice. They work perfectly fine for me with my Samsungs and iPads. AirPods Pro are the best","32":"\n>But still nowhere near the APP's\n\nyou mentioned the transparency mode wasn't as good, which was one of the main features I was excited for. I've never experienced transparency mode, would you say the pixel's is good enough for using in school or in a conversation?","33":"[deleted]","34":"Are you saying you got ANC and Transparency from the APP to work with a Pixel Phone? How? I thought those didn't work","35":"Man I wish there was a collection of cute cases for the pixel buds like there are for APP","36":"Do you know if the case dimensions are the same as the A series? I have a custom case I'm hoping will fit the new pros.","37":"How good are the microphones? Especially in wind.","38":"Is one of your pixel buds shinier than the other one? I got mine today and one of them is Mate and the other one is shinny \ud83d\ude16","39":"I'm curious how the case will hold. I was one of the many that got a little hairline crack in the OG buds case after a few months. It's not like I was slamming the case shut either","40":"Nice LTT desk pad my guy","41":"How is the multipoint connectivity between Android and windows laptop? I want to use these at work so that I can listen to music on my phone, take a teams meeting on my laptop etc without having to disconnect","42":"Can other people hear what you're listening to? That's why I returned my original Pixel Buds. The transparency vent allows too much noise to bleed out, especially as compared to the original and second gen Airpods. A major use case for me is on the airplane and subway, so this is crucial. To being a good neighbor.","43":"If it wasn't for the high frequencies piercing my ears, I would say the Pixel Buds for sure. If I'm able to find a custom EQ software to turn the treble down and turn the mids up, then no probs. Otherwise, if this is a long term thing and isn't fixed through a software update or third party app, it would be a deal breaker. I care about my ear health more.","44":"AirPods Pro are awesome with android . Best thing on the market","45":"I probably wouldn't be comfortable with that, but I intend on getting comply foam tips anyway, which would essentially rid that concern for me. Hopefully that helps!","46":"This is also my biggest concern. I bike a lot and have had issues with one ear bud falling out and losing it forever. I just got my Bud Pros in the mail today, first thing I did was jump around, shake my head as hard as I could, and try to get them to fall out. They didn't budge at all. These are probably the best comfort pair of buds I've ever owned.","47":"Great question, I had not thought of that while making them . Thinking back to when I rated each, I would say relative, as I am coming from 2 years experience of the APP's and am spoiled by it's existing feature set.","48":"Glad I could help!","49":"This is my biggest concern. I have the A series and people literally here everything other than my voice. If the Buds Pro fix this, I'll probably get them.","50":"Not OP, but so far it's been great for me. I came from the 2020 Pixel Buds, which frequently got comments about how clear I sounded on video calls even with one bud in. Haven't had has much to sample with yet, but so far the experience has been good on video calls.","51":"I haven't answered this just yet as I haven't put myself in a noisy enough situation to give you the answer you're looking for. But I will definitely give you one by end of day today, and plan on driving with the windows rolled down on the highway and with them up.","52":"Here's my update:\n\nSo far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they haven't commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","53":"Just a heads up, I have updated the post to include call quality. Hope it helps!","54":"ANC Is better on the WF, but not by much. You'd have to really be paying attention to notice the difference, otherwise Google did an excellent job.","55":"I'm glad this is relevant to you! That's exactly why I made this, as I was looking for something like this but couldn't find any myself.\n\nIn regards to connectivity, I had the exact same issues that you are, in fact, sometimes I had to unpair and repair my AirPods. Sometimes one side would connect and the other wouldn't, sometimes they would just automatically disconnect and reconnect. Just constant issues, but as you know, they were worth overlooking given the amazing features that the AirPods pros were offering.\n\nFor me, when I tried the A series last year, they wouldn't stay in my ears for longer than 3 seconds, and they constantly popped out. So I had the opposite experience in regards to fit. In regards to the AirPods, if I was on a jog, they would definitely be falling out. However, I did buy comply foam ear tips, and I would strongly recommend you do the same, because they make the fit 100% secure. I will be doing the same for the pixel Bud pros as well.\n\nYes absolutely, if ANC is a priority for you, the buds will blow you away in comparison to the AirPod pros. Very noticeable positive difference. And lucky you, you get to enjoy the best of both worlds!","56":"What is APP","57":"I feel your pain man!","58":"Yup! I don't have that blocked feeling! However, Transparency mode has been mastered on the APP's, so there does feel like a bit of noise blockage, but not plugged at all like I've experienced others. I hope that makes sense!","59":"[My cat sleeping!](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LYmMsvO.jpg)","60":"Created a video just for you\n\nhttps:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/bM9R34wfPSmYMHcN8","61":"So far just tested on my phone and YouTube, YT Music audio sync looks to be on point. Are there any apps you'd like me to specifically test?\n\nYes you can definitely sleep with them against a pillow. Significantly better than APP's. \n\nI too have had constant issues with connecting the APP's to my Pixel. So far in my few hours of use, not one connection\/disconnection issue at all. Also according to other reviews, battery life is excellent and surpasses what is marketed even with ANC on. \n\nYou'll be happy to know that ANC is very noticeably superior on the PBP's in comparison to the APP's.\n\nStill  testing, but at preliminary recommendation, if I can find an EQ software to turn the high frequencies down, then yes I would recommend the Buds over the Airpods.","62":"Glad to hear it! I don't think you'll be disappointed.","63":"Nope! My wife can't hear it and I'm sitting right beside her while she's in bed, playing the same song you just mentioned.","64":"I'm sorry I don't have a pair of Pixel Buds 2 or A series to compare to, but I can tell you they are significantly more flush in comparison to the Airpods Pros if that helps!","65":"Mine feel about as flush as my 2020 pixelbuds. Taking off my shirt after a bike ride today they didn't come out, if that's any help :)","66":"I have both and they stick out a bit further than the A series but not by much. I tested them with my motorcycle helmet (Shoei RF-1200) and I can feel the helmet pushing against the buds a little bit. It feels more like they're being held in place vs being pushed into my ears though. I'd compare the sensation to if you had the buds in and you placed your hand in a cup over your ears until the tips of the buds just touched your hands. Hope that helps!","67":"I just tried with about five different videos on Chromecast with Google TV and everything seemed perfectly fine.","68":"Absolutely!","69":"Just had a conversation with a buddy for about an hour. In regards to battery life over that call, and some music and videos this morning, I'm at 95% on the left, and 89% on the right. I'd say that over about 2 hours of use with a mix of ANC and transparency.","70":"Also would like to know this once OP has had some time to get a feel for it","71":"It just dawned on me that I can test it with my wife's iPhone when she comes home. No Apple Music though still, but I think they implemented it with Disney+ if I'm not mistaken? Results to come shortly.","72":"Sorry, not sure! I'm not testing it with an iPhone, nor do I have Apple music.","73":"Connectivity is surprisingly phenomenal. They surpass the AirPod pros. In fact. Multipoint is phenomenal, works in between devices and automatically pauses the one that's not playing. Even if one is playing and I try to unpause the one that's not playing, it will automatically pause that one. Hard to explain but once you get them you'll understand what I mean!","74":"Thanks!","75":"Thanks! I'm glad it brought some value to you!","76":"Yes they do! Unfortunately not on my Gen 1 Pixel Charger, but it works apparently on the Gen 2.\n\n\\*\\*Edit they do charge upside down on the Gen 1! Woohoo!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt does work through Battery share on my Pixel 6 Pro.","77":"Wireless charging is mentioned on Google's product page, right near the top.","78":"I absolutely agree! It'll be a hard transition for me too, but so worth it now that I'm finally sticking with the Google ' ecosystem'!","79":"I'm sorry I'm not clear on your question, can you elaborate on what you're looking for?","80":"The sound is marginally superior, but the Air Pods Pro is a better overall product -- especially with how they don't actually go in your ears and the spatial audio. Mediocre execution from Google as usual and I'm a fanboy.\n\nRight now, I'm still waiting to hear something better than the Jabra 75t, though I haven't tried all those new Kickstarter earbuds with multiple drivers.","81":"Not sure how to respond to this... Do you have a question you'd like me to answer?","82":"According to Google, yes it is\n\nhttps:\/\/store.google.com\/product\/pixel\\_buds\\_pro\\_specs?hl=en-US#:\\~:text=Pixel%20Buds%20Pro%20are%20designed,repair%2C%20disassembly%2C%20or%20damage.","83":"Just checked, unfortunately nothing under the sound screen like you mentioned! Might just be a pixel buds Pro omission.https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Vuz6h7h.png\n\nAlso, I'll check your app suggestion out. Thanks so much!","84":"Pleasure!","85":"So I don't have Netflix, but I did check with Prime Video and Disney plus and both have no noticeable latency at all. I hope that helps!","86":"That's great to hear that it's working for your Samsung well! I would hope that it worked well with your iPad as well.\n\nI had said that it doesn't play nice with my pixel. Also a lot of other people in this community feel the same way in regards to pixel and AirPod connection issues. Hopefully that clears that up.","87":"Easy answer: absolutely. Especially if you haven't experienced the AirPods at all. The transparency mode on the pixel buds Pro is very functional.","88":"So far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they have in commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","89":"It just works when you connect them, hold on the button to toggle between the two","90":"I'm not a case person, but I can completely understand that! I'm sure they'll come out soon.\n\nI'm Looking forward to dbrand skins!","91":"Hope this helps!\n\n[Pixel buds Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/m2LZalj.png)\n\n[Pixel buds A series](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZsIRlvn.png)","92":"Just had a conversation with a buddy while walking in some light wind, for about an hour. No issues at all, I could hear him and he could hear me clearly. Also, in regards to battery life over that call, and some music and videos this morning, I'm at 95% on the left, and 89% on the right. I'd say that over about 2 hours of use with a mix of ANC and transparency. I know you didn't ask, but in case you were wondering!","93":"Just checked, and confirmed that is not the case for me!","94":"I'm sorry to hear that! I'm not sure about that, I plan on getting a dbrand skin the moment they release it, hopefully that will mitigate any possibility of that happening!","95":"Thanks!","96":"Just tried it, seamless as fcuk. I pause music on the phone and play it on the computer, and it automatically plays. Vice versa pausing music on the computer, and playing on the phone, it's like instant. Zero lag. This is better than the AirPods multipoint variant IMO","97":"The product page says there will be an in app EQ customizer in the fall, so hopefully sooner than later.","98":"Look into the app Wavelet for an easy to use equalizer for Android and customized Eq for most headphones out there.","99":"Wavelet is a godsend. Best EQ I've ever used","100":"What videos or songs are giving you this issue?\n\nJust curious because I have the series A and never had issues with high frequency. I wanna test it out for myself.","101":"A few reviews have suggested using some bass boost something or another with them.  Have you tried that?","102":"You didn't give a direct comparison on sound to the APPs. I know APPs use a different inferior codec when paired to an Android phone so curious what the APPs on your Android would get out of 10 if the pixel bud pros are 7\/10","103":"Pixel buds software allows you to adjust bass and treble. Open the Pixel buds app. Settings; scroll down to \"Sound\"; slide the base from \"Less\" to \"More\" and turn on Volume EQ.  This makes my Pixel Buds A series sound incredible.","104":"Can you share the link please?","105":"Thank you for the review.","106":"I can confirm people can hear me clearly in the few different environments that I've tested, so if that's what you've been experiencing on the A series, I think your woes will be forgotten When switching over to these.","107":"People I call on the buds 2 say that same thing, really hominy this is addressed with the pros. I guess I'll find out tomorrow.","108":"So far I would concur with your experience. Indoor call quality is excellent, and people have said they can hear me just fine.","109":"Update on this: \n\nSo far so great. I've talked to a few people while walking, driving, in wind and in and out of stores and they haven't commented on call quality. When I've asked them exclusively about it, they've said everything sounds great and they can hear me clearly. Mind you I have LTE plus pretty much everywhere I go as I live in a major city.","110":"Glad to hear .. being able to make and receive phone calls is a big selling point for me as well as the clarity of the calls ..\n\nThanks for your real world testing","111":"Great thanks!","112":"Air pods pro","113":"Thanks! Hopefully Google will improve the transparency mode over time. I tried a lot of earphones overtime and no one beats the APP's yet.","114":"Thanks for paying the cat tax","115":"Awwww how awesome! Little tiger there","116":"You're a legend! \n\nNot terrible, but looks to be worse than the Pixel Buds 2 \ud83d\ude22","117":"Is that LTT pad ?","118":"My main video apps are YT and VLC on both Pixel and PC.  You can adjust audio delay on VLC, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nSounds like a worthwhile upgrade, subject to the EQ issue.\n\nThanks!","119":"sorry been busy... dude you know that song??? That song is so underrated man... I mean the opera and everything gave me goosebumps the first I heard it","120":"Thanks for testing.","121":"Nice! I have an older pair of regular airpods and the battery life has been incredible so was hoping these would be at least comparable","122":"Hope you saw my reply up top!","123":"Hell yes - thank you for checking!","124":"Definitely, thank you. It's hard to find actual reviews","125":"Do they charge on the gen 1 charger if you flip the case upside down?\n\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/madebygoogle\/status\/1255564182075797504","126":"That might be worth the upgrade alone. I got the Pixel Buds Series A last December after getting pixel 6 in November. \n\nThanks for the details!","127":">Unfortunately not on my Gen 1 Pixel Charger\n\nWell that's kind of a bummer. I'll probably end up charging them overnight using Battery Share most of the time, but it still would have been nice to have the option to charge them using the 1st gen Pixel Stand.","128":"Lol not going to lie I can't believe I've done it myself. This pixel has been pretty damn nice. Minus Android auto.","129":"Sorry about the confusion aha. I shouldn't have used the question mark.","130":"Apparently just IPX2, so probably won't survive an accidental run through the washer. Luckily I have never done that before with my As...","131":"Damn. The bass control was added as a firmware update to the Pixel Buds A-Series, so maybe they'll do the same for the Pros.","132":"Is the bass on these ok or underwhelming? I'm trying to decide between these and the Beats Fit Pro since I listen to a lot of EDM and those are supposed to have good bass","133":"Yes thanks!!","134":"How? I\u2019ve never had it disconnect . Used with my fold 3, note 10+, pixels, etc. zero issues. And that\u2019s with AirPods 1, 2, and the pros. They work perfectly Fine. I guess only annoying thing is I can\u2019t change their options and what they do when you tap so I have to use my iPad for that but other than that, they work great, they even auto connect to my phone if I\u2019m not near my iPad. They work great. Zero issue and best pods on the market. Air pod pros are best thing apple makes.","135":"Yep it does work. Just no customization, since Apple does not offer an app for Androids. Similar to pixel buds on iOS, no app for iOS.","136":"That's awesome! I remember V1 buds had some exceptional mic and wind cancelling tech. Hope they didn't make compromises there.","137":"Niiiice. I will be going to my BestBuy to get them today. Thanks","138":"Hey that's amazing! Might be worth finding a 3rd party solution then. Will test and get back to you.","139":"Thanks for the suggestion!\n\nAfter downloading, am not able to figure it out. Do you have a guide you recommend to set it up?","140":"He's probably more sensitive to treble, some people are some aren't.","141":"Pretty much on almost every video in Youtube. Music in YT music doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=26qUyrVKBNs&t=327s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=26qUyrVKBNs&t=327s)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AREK4H8k7Ng&t=1s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AREK4H8k7Ng&t=1s)\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dTh-7JYsp5k&t=105s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dTh-7JYsp5k&t=105s)","142":"I haven't found any bass boost options, can you link me to those reviews that mention it?","143":"9\/10 for the APPs, but really the only app that seems to be causing issues is YouTube. YT Music after my few hours of testing now I would give the PBP's a 9\/10 as well. Base sounds more full on these than Apple.","144":"I wish it were there! But unfortunately not available on the pixel buds Pro software as of yet. If you look through these comments, you'll see a screenshot of it as somebody else suggested this as well. Thanks!","145":"Link for?","146":"Pleasure!","147":"Thanks! I went ahead and pulled the trigger on the Charcoal.","148":"I updated the post in regards to call quality, hope it helps!","149":"Pleasure!","150":"Thanks \ud83d\udc4d","151":"I concur !","152":"Lol seriously","153":"Not sure about that sorry, can only compare to the Airpods. I can confidently say they are on par in regards to magnet attraction, for lack of a better term.","154":"Yup! Lttstore.com ;)","155":"NP!","156":"Pleasure!","157":"I think you'll be impressed!","158":"Just confirmed, Spatial audio does not work. I double checked with my old AirPod pros to make sure I was in the right setting as well. Sorry!\n\nFor the record, I checked in Disney+","159":"Fuck Yeah! Well done, they do!","160":"Sounds good!","161":"They do charge on gen 1, but you need to flip the case upside down\n\nhttps:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/madebygoogle\/status\/1255564182075797504","162":"I'm sorry to hear, Android auto hasn't gotten any better? I used to have a car that supported it, but just gave that lease back about a year ago and take transit now.","163":"Same as A Series\n\nFWIW my dad's A series went through the wash and survived. Had problems shortly after but a factory reset solved it","164":"EQ for the Buds Pro isn't coming until the fall.","165":"Google store says 5 babe eq sliders coming in the fall for the buds pro","166":"I think you'll love this. Bass is excellent. Very full. But then again that is my opinion, I'd suggest you get them and try them out, return period is 30 days if they're really that bad for you.","167":"Sounds good man! You're lucky!","168":"Wavelet works with anything.","169":"Try Poweramp. Good app.","170":"Wavelet's Pixel Buds preset took my Pixel Buds (2020) to an entirely different level. Can't listen to anything without it. It's a great little app. Maybe start there and see if the EQ is to your liking. [**Here's the EQ with the preset**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/V7tE4W3.png). Just search \"Pixel Buds\" and you should see it. Select it, and whenever you use the buds, it'll automatically select that preset and you're good to go.","171":"Open the app and click the \"power button\" on and it will turn blue. \n\n-Then you will want to click the gear on the bottom right side and turn on legacy mode to see all the settings. \n\n-If you turn off legacy mode, those settings will only show up if you have audio playing in the background. \n\n\n\nNow turn on AutoEq and it will bring up a search menu. \n\n-Type in Pixel and you'll see a bunch of options like pixel buds (2017), pixel buds 2020, series-A, etc but nothing for the Pro's. \n\n-I'm sure it will have them added in a few days. \n\n\n\nIf you want to use a present Graphic Equalizer in the meantime, you may need to pay for the app. (I bought it in 2020 so I can't remember). \n\n-To turn on the graphic equalizer, look under AutoEq and click on the name graphic equalizer. \n\n-It has a bunch of presets with the default being flat, but you can create your own personal equalizer settings at the bottom of the menu. \n\n\n\nHope that helps!","172":"Wasn't really sure what you were talking about til swapping back and forth between my pixel buds and APPs. I'm no audio expert but the APPs' sound seems richer on these videos. I hadn't noticed and honestly don't know if I would have if I didn't go looking for the difference.","173":"Btw, what color did you get?","174":"Excellent! Welcome to the club!","175":"No need to apologize - I appreciate you taking the time!","176":"Yeah spatial audio is due to come later this year to the PBP along with the graphic EQ. \n\nI'm hoping it'll come with the launch of Android 13, but it's more probable that those features come with the launch of the Pixel 7 & 7Pro.","177":"Nice! Was worried I'd have to use a cable or get a new charger","178":"Hah, that was going to be the first thing I tried. Good to know it'll work.\n\nedit: Wait this is from April 2020. Assuming everything's the same design\/dimensions as before, it *should* still work, in theory?","179":"I mean it has gotten better since it's first release lol but compared to Carplay it's pretty much garbage. I'm sure it will get better though","180":"Damn Google really going for 5 babe EQ sliders, didn't expect that.","181":"Will do, thanks!","182":"Do you turn on pixel's volume eq and boost bass?","183":"I'll check it out, thanks!","184":"Holy shit. I've been using custom presets via Wavelet for roughly a year, but had no clue that a PB preset existed (PB-A in my case.) Thank you, random reddit stranger. They sound great!","185":"I'm with these guys, Wavelet transformed my Pixel Buds from mediocre and disappointing to very good. My Bose cans definitely sound better, but my Pixel Buds with Wavelet are the best ear buds I've ever used (minus the occasional annoying pairing issues, but I blame that on shitty Bluetooth on my P6P). \n\nKinda sucks you need an app to get the most out of them, but they really do transform when you install it and get your EQ dialed in.","186":"Sounds good! I did try that Auto EQ but it actually sounded more trebly than before, so I will wait for the PBP Auto EQ release! Hopefully will be out soon!","187":"Omg this is amazing, gave up on Android EQ since like 2015 when I remember they disabled it or something. Now my qc35iis sound so much better!","188":"That helps, thank you!

But I can confirm that wavelet is close to accurate.","210":"I played with the multiple pixel buds presets available and settled on the \"Pixel Buds 2020\" preset as it was much more subtle, and \"brightened\" the highs just enough to add a significant amount of clarity without it sounding tinny, or making the mids\/lows sound muddy. Of course YMMV since everyone's ears are different, but the A-Series present did sound a bit more subdued to me as well.","211":"I did try that but it didn't make anything different on YouTube, which seems to be the main culprit right now.","212":"That's basically called as sound staging. Different earphones have different levels of sound staging and most of them try to mimic the sort of staging where you should feel as though you are in an orchestra or something like that where there are many instruments playing at once and you are able to identify different instruments based on the direction of sound.","213":"Yes! So you're experiencing the same thing I am! Thank God I'm not going crazy.","214":"Here you are sir!\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dybI6dB","215":"I'm using AA every day for several hours and I'm really happy with it.

Although I'll be getting my Pixel buds Pro so it'll be obsolete later XD","217":"Did you enable the dump permission and notification access? If that doesn't work then dang lol hopefully the fall eq update fixes it","218":"It isn't bothering me as much as it sounds like it's bothering you though.

Appreciate your efforts!","221":"Can you post a picture of the buds in the case? I'd like to see how different the fog color is from the white color of the case","222":"Well for one, you'll need batter to make porterhouse0's bday cake! ;)\n\nSecond, carplay doesn't seem to glitch out as much as AA, at least from the experience I had a year ago for about 4 years straight on my Honda civic hatch. \n\nFrom what this user is saying, it's not changed much.\n\nWhat type of phone do you have That has it run so smooth?","223":"Just the dump permission for now. I do hear a few of the EQs making a bit of a difference, but still the same high treble type of situation. Sounds like further optimization is needed for the YouTube app with the pixel buds Pro as a whole, but again not sure since I'm not a software engineer.","224":"Compare that experience to a song like this, and it's like day and night difference in regards to audio quality:\n\nhttps:\/\/music.youtube.com\/watch?v=5Eqb_-j3FDA&feature=share\n\n(It's an Indian song but still you'd be able to appreciate the dynamic sound)","225":"Good eye!","226":"Thanks!

I did some pics against different backgrounds so you'd get a better idea.","228":"Using a Pixel 5 most of the time and I rarely have any glitches, except it's getting too hot in the summer.","229":"The pixel buds pro are very new, but if you wait a bit, the app will update with a profile specifically for the pixel buds pro.","230":"Ok ya it's pretty different. The Airpod Pros >>> Pixel Buds Pro when listening to this song. \n\nI'm really hoping this is something they can improve with some firmware updates.","231":"Looking forward to that!","232":"It'll honestly be a bit.

","239":"Trying to decide between these and Airpods. What would you recommend? Also, are they water\/sweatresistant?","240":"Thank you for this review. I have ordered the Pixel Buds, which won't ship until mid-December. I currently own a BeatsX (bought a refub from Best Buy for around $60). I love the fit but am disappointed in the sound quality. I listen to all sorts of stuff, and most of the electronic dance music sounds flat and distant. The volume is amazing. I have plenty of time to return it... \n\nYou mentioned you too own BeatsX, if it's not too much to ask, could you please compare the Buds to BeatsX in the three criteria: quality of sound, volume and fit. \n\nThank you very much.","241":"I still maintain that the airpods are the best completely wireless buds for Android right now. Small, decent sounding, great battery for the size, and very functional storage case. The big downside is they look weird, and could have looked much better if apple just offered them in black.","242":"You should xpost this to \/r\/headphones with some pics! We would love to discuss these further.","243":"So they can translate a live conversation. Can they translate a phone conversation being routed through them via Bluetooth? This would be ground breaking.","244":"This review was almost perfectly tailored for me. Great stuff! Waiting for my pixel buds to ship but using the X3s currently. Would you prefer the pixel buds over the x3s?","245":"Thanks for the quick impression. I needed to hear this. I have mine on order and they arrive at the end of the month, so it's good to hear someone having a pleasent experience with them. ","246":"I am intending to buy these over the holiday season for myself but I intend on carrying them with me 24\/7 every day so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me how they feel in the pocket. Is the case thin\/small enough that you could carry it in your front pocket without it bothering you or sticking out in tighter pants? This is the main reason (other than 49$) that I am leaning towards these VS the Icon X 2018s (they should drop the fitness tracking and lower the price by 49$ if you ask me)","247":"Great review! ","248":">\tAirpods would get quite uncomfortable after 15+ minutes of use, but the Pixel Buds have the advantage of not actually going into your ear canal. \n\nI think you are wearing the AirPods wrong. They specifically are designed not to go into your ear canal, and just rest in your outer ear. They aren\u2019t supposed to create a seal. \n\nWhen I first used Apple\u2019s EarPods, I had the same problem of becoming uncomfortable after 15-30 minutes of use, because I was pressing them deeper into my ear to try and maintain a seal. \n\nNow, I can wear the AirPods for hours and sometimes forget they are in my ears, just like you do with the Pixel Buds. ","249":"Anymore details on the translation? Thats the most interesting feature to me. ","250":"Can you see and try to use the translate?","251":"> so I left them charging for another 30 minutes and tried again. Thankfully, the sound was much improved.\n\nDoes this mean sound quality decreases as the battery decreases?","252":"It's amazing to me how people just skip over the sound quality. The most important thing on a thing that makes sound as it's main purpose isn't the main thing to review?\n\nAmazing.","253":"When the buds die how long to charge them back up from the case?","254":"Did you try the OG IconX before? If so, can you let me know your thoughts of these vs the IconX? Leaving out the difference of the Buds being able to do live translations. I don't have a pixel and don't plan to get one. ","255":"If only there were a way to have headphones that don't need a battery to run \/s","256":"Great to here. Really wanted these but couldn't justify them after getting the Jaybird freedoms at Best buy for $50","257":"Is any functionality lost when using with a Samsung or LG phone?","258":"How about switching between devices?\n\nAside from an easy, one time only pairing, I choose the AirPods because going between devices is dead easy. On iOS, you can just toggle the AirPlay icon to switch. I use my AirPods with my Apple Watch to listen to music on my morning run and switch back to the iPhone during my commute. Is it the same for the Pixel bud (as seemless and easy I mean). ","259":"I have some Shure SE535s I adore and just couldn't lose their sound quality (+I can use a wireless adaptor and make them like the pixel buds too) but for some reason I really want a pair still and idk why","260":"For the price, I just can't see them outperforming the JayBird X3, which come with built in custom DAC that you can tweak with the MySound app.\n\nAlso around 8hrs battery life...","261":"Wish it was dynamic, or if the phone could show both.","262":"it has both the level of the buds and the level of the case.","263":"Yeah, that was full volume while using assistant and calls. Being able to charge quickly helps. But yeah, not for everyone.","264":"Agreed. 4-5 hours isn't enough. That's why I haven't switched from my Jaybirds, I had the original X's that crapped out 2 weeks ago and I replaced them with X3's that were on sale for 125CDN. I definitely get 8 hours of podcasting out of them, and I work in a pretty loud automotive assembly plant. ","265":"So do you listen to music\/content for >4 hours a day? Seems a bit much...","266":"call me crazy but I just don't trust having batteries that close to my ears.","267":"I'll try to get my hands on them!","268":"I have them and I think they are great.  Sound good for earbuds, have ambient sound which is pretty good, and battery seems to be solid.  I'm pretty happy with the purchase as I thought I would be disappointed because in some reviews people said dthey where uncomfortable.  However, personally using the tips and wingtips out the box I haven't had a problem at all.  ","269":"You can! Just tried it.\n\nYou cannot use the case to charge your phone, however.","270":"No, it doesn't.\n\nPixel XL.","271":"[deleted]","272":"What phone do you have? I couldn't find an actual spec but they at least lasted a workout, haha.","273":"AirPods are water resistant. And the 'truly wireless' is a must have for me (they last 5 hours individually or 6 hours together) plus you can charge ONE at a time while you still use one... etc.","274":"Wait for reviews. So far airpods are rated very highly so the pixel buds have a lot to prove. ","275":"Beats headphones are the most overrated products on the market IMO. I listened to the over-the-ear models and the bass was extremely distorted at 75%+ volume. I haven't tested the earbuds, but they are extremely expensive for what you get considering cheaper options are available.\n\nOn that note, I have both the microphone and non-mic versions of the Panasonic RP-HJE120-K In-Ear Headphones and they work, they're relatively durable, extremely cheap, and sound great. Now, I understand these are headphones that plug into a 3.5mm jack but the amount of positive reviews on amazon speak for themselves.","276":"Well for completely wireless buds, there's not much competition. But I agree with you.","277":"Disagree. Afaik they lack a lot of functionally, simply because you didn't buy an Iphone, but you're still paying for those features, which you have no access to. I don't like to support a company that doesn't support the products i like. I would rather reward a company that doesn't punish you for buying an android phone.\n\n","278":"Regarding Airpods not being offered in black, I had to find a something because I couldn't do the white lol. It's not perfect, but still better imo.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.screencast.com\/t\/Hc9A6jR24","279":"I'll do that tonight!","280":"Thanks!\n\nYes, by far, but that's mostly because of charging and features. I liked the X3 sound, but the PB don't make me miss them much.","281":"Thank you!","282":"I can see how you would think that, but I've tried it multiple ways. It's different ears. I could have tried tips for the Airpods, but it wasn't worth it to me.","283":"I did.","284":"It only happened that one time. It was bizarre. I ran them down because I had the same thought as you.","285":"Like I said, I'm not an audiophile and don't know a ton about sound. They sound good to me. Others sound better, some sound worse. \n\nI think you're missing the point of these if you think they're just headphones as well. There's a lot to talk about.","286":"As far as I've been able to gather from various \"reviews\" or opinions....Is that sound quality isn't $160 worth. Its good enough, but not comparable to anything wired you would spend $160 on.","287":"Yes, I returned mine. Honestly I hardly remember using them, because the battery was so bad. But I plan on keeping these.","288":"The whole live translate feature I believe, but nothing else.","289":"Correct. I just hated the charger. The buds were great.","290":"I was under the impression that there's an LED above those that shows battery of the buds. Just flashes certain colors.","291":"My problem is the battery drain on the phone side (Pixel 1 regular) with continuous use of Bluetooth audio. On days that I don't use BT headphones, my battery is around 50% when I'm driving home. If I use BT headphones for eight hours, my phone is at 10% when I'm driving home.","292":"I love my X3s, but I've put them through so much abuse that I'm considering replacing them. The Pixel buds battery life seems to be the only thing holding me off. Here's hoping for an X4 announcement soon.","293":"Yes, public transportation x nosy coworkers x nosy neighbors= 5-6 hours minimum per day. Have to swap between a pair mdrzx780dc (noise cancelling my ass) and a pair of xb950bt's. \n\n","294":"Just having to charge them everyday is already a huge inconvenience imo.","295":"> So do you listen to music\/content for >4 hours a day? Seems a bit much...\n\nYes. I work an 8 hour shift on most days and sometimes it goes more than that. I listen to music\/podcasts for the entire duration unless I am talking to clients.","296":"I know a few people with desk jobs who listen to music at work all day. ","297":"I use headphones 5-6 hours a day at my office.  One of the downsides to \"agile\" workspaces is that there's too much noise distraction.\n","298":"I'm listening to music probably 8 hours a day","299":"Not the person you are replying to but I do as a software developer. The charging time isn't a killer but it is slightly annoying.","300":"What if you listen to media while at work? Thats 8 hours right there. Plus travel time, plus any other time you might listen to some media. 4 hours a day or more doesn't sound at all to be a bit much to me.","301":"Pretty much necessary in a 'modern' office. I listen to music all day otherwise I wouldn't be able to get any work done.","302":"I work as a system engineer and often fall into holes where I have music playing while I am coding. Those holes can last entire workdays. A lot of my colleagues are like this too. ","303":"What if you're making a call with your phone though?","304":"You\u2019re crazy. ","305":"Goddamnit","306":"How long have you had your Pixel XL? Are you enjoying it?","307":"Airpods do.","308":"The Airpods do, which is why some were hoping for it here. It's pretty cool to use. ","309":"Right now a Sony Z5 compact, but I just ordered a Pixel 2 (kinda blue). Not sure how much I'd use the assistant, but it might be neat. I've played around with my friends AirPods and I was quite impressed with the range and the fact that without the cord they feel a bit more free. I have a pair of Sony Nwz-ws613 now, but they are a bit bulky for everyday use. \n\nI do however workout quite a lot, both weight lifting and running, so sweat resistance is a must. I don't think the Airpods are officially sweat proof, but there are a lot of reports of this not being an issue. Not a lot of data on the Pixel Buds yet. \n\nJust wanted to know if there was something in the box or leaflet about sweat :)","310":"I'm in the same boat trying to decide which ones to go with. I have a pixel 2 XL.","311":"No idea why you're getting downvoted for saying this...","312":"Well it depends on what features you need. I just wanted play\/pause which I get with the airpods. I wouldn't use Siri or Google Assistant anyway.","313":"They literally don't lack any functionality other than quick pairing because apple doesn't write the software for Android. ","314":"Colorware also does a full black version but expect to pay for it...","315":"You'll probably get hung out to dry. Wireless stuff is not welcome in \/r\/headphones. ","316":"Well, I guess that I'll be happy upgrading from the X2s.\n\nDo the pairing features take a downgrade with non Google phones? Are you aware?","317":"Fair enough. I just thought from your phrasing that you were implying the AirPods are supposed to go into your ear canals, and they definitely aren\u2019t. ","318":"How well does that work exactly compared to what was shown in the demo on stage?","319":"This is what I've heard too.\n\nIf you're looking for quality and Google Assistant, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II would probably be a better option. They are headphones (not earbuds) though.","320":"Yup and Google hasn't made headphones before so expecting great sound quality from them is a fool's errand. ","321":"They did completely rectify that mistake with the second version of the IconX, as it was without a doubt the biggest improvement to them.","322":"Understandable. The battery life is pretty abysmal on these things. It's just hard swallowing $160 when I'll never own a Pixel and I got the IconX for $55 with a two year replacement plan","323":"Probably the most important part of the buds.","324":"You can view the buds battery on the phone.","325":"So in your day you're telling me that you listen for >4 hours straight? Because otherwise you have time within your day to put your buds in the case where they recharge....","326":"I mean charging the buds just means putting them in the case. They made it as hassle free as they could.","327":"People used to say this about phones.","328":"You obviously don't understand how small the batteries are inside a small earbud like this....you're just not going to get all day battery life, period. Hence when even apple decided to provide a charging case....","329":"Honestly I have a pair of wired headphones for when I'm sitting down for long periods, and wireless headphones for when I'm cooking, commuting, or otherwise moving about. Works pretty great, although of course I'd rather have wireless 100% of the time.","330":"I second this. I actually switched back to wired IEM and use BT when im walking or exercising. ","331":"Who even does that any more? ","332":"Well you can tap the right earbud when when you take it out in one motion and achieve the same result.\n\nDoesn't work with the left one though \ud83e\udd14","333":"No proximity sensor.","334":"Holy fuck, that's amazing.","335":"It's not either of these, but I have the Erato Rio 3, and they're the best headphones I've ever used for running, and they're fantastic for weightlifting too. The range is pretty decent and the batteries last me about 6ish hours. Really love my pair. ","336":"If you just wanted those features, then there are loads of options available, and most of those options would probably offer a much better sound for your money. The speaker driver and such in the Airpods are the same as the ones inside the earpods that you get for free, so the sound quality isn't awesome. You're paying for the features, not the sound, and you don't have access to some of them.\n\nEdit: a lot of Airpods fanboys in here. Nothing i said is factually wrong. Ask any audiophile if Airpods provides good sound quality for the money, they don't. They will all tell you that they're really bad for the price. ","337":"Proximity sensor doesn't work and because android doesn't use their proprietary chip, you get less battery life as well.\n\nAlso some features may need an app? I want to say google now support and track switching. \n","338":"Then I won't do that tonight!","339":"Yes, these blow away the X2s. And I believe the pairing works with any Android phone on Oreo, but I'm probably wrong.","340":"My understanding is that everything but live Google Translate works on non Pixel phones.","341":"Oh okay. Yeah not entirely, but they definitely fit further into my ear when just putting them in normally.","342":"Sorry, didn't mean to hit post. I'm at work right now. But it's exactly like what they demoed. I'll try to get a video.","343":"Yeah, which is great. I'll have to try out the 2nd gen.","344":"In my specific case since I switch between two pairs no, but if I had these google pixel buds as my daily drivers then yes, between public transport, nosy coworkers, and nosy neighbors. Other than some rare situation that work require my complete focus\/attention they'd be on and playing some sort of music\/youtube video\/other sort of streaming podcast or video for 5-6+ hours straight at the very least. ","345":"This is the main draw for me. The fact that whenever you're not using it it's charging without cords (assuming the case is charged). That's amazing.","346":"And charging them that often will make their battery life useless in two years or so.","347":"I never stopped saying this","348":"You know, it's okay to point out that for some folks the buds aren't really practical, even if they're technological marvels.  For some folks, four hour battery life doesn't make any sense for a pair of earphones.  Just like for folks who have had watches in the past that last three years on a battery, a smartwatch that lasts no more than a day isn't practical.\n\nTo each his\/her own, I say.","349":"Which is another disadvantage compared to wired headphones. If wireless headphones are to be my only option besides a dongle I'm going to want headphones that will last close to a day.","350":"Exactly why I don't want batteries. I want hydrogen fuel cells in each ear. I demand that as a bare minimum for blood money for the death of 3.5mm","351":"[deleted]","352":"> The speaker driver and such in the Airpods are the same as the ones inside the earpods that you get for free, so the sound quality isn't awesome\n\nI actually have both, and I can definitely tell you that the AirPods sound considerably better.","353":"Can you name a few of these options? I've tried a bunch and they all have fatal flaws. Samsung's having terrible battery life, others that fit so poorly and are uncomfortable, etc.\n\nI've tried many of the cheap ones and they are garbage too.\n\nThe airpods just pop in, they work perfectly each time, and sound fine. Plus they don't block sound so I can actually walk around with them outside and not worry about getting hit by a car.\n\nCurious how you know the driver is the same as on the earpod. Apple doesn't release that info.","354":"Awesome, thanks for the input! I'll try to find a confirmation :)","355":"They don't go inside mine at all... Had them since December 2016","356":"That's fine. Appreciate it, thank you.","357":"You know if you have them in the case and the case has charged them to 100% they are not power cycling. Also the case likely has a circuit that is turning them off until the case is opened. Both factors limiting charge cycles and extending their battery life. ","358":"It's funny how you have to make a point that day long battery life is a low bar for headphones.  Technology is supposed to blend into the background and make life easier.  Now it's turning life into a resource management adventure, where you gotta keep everything charged, yet find time in your day to actually enjoy the tech.","359":"Gear IconX 2018 are my new favorite headphone","360":"Personal anecdotes are okay, but when Apple has actually said that the audio components of the free earpods and expensive Airpods are essentially identical, then that takes presidence over personal anecdotes.\n\nObviously, they aren't going to sound identical, as Apple probably tuned the Airpods a little different, but that really doesn't change the fact that the audio components are the same quality as the ones you get for free with your smartphone. So it's going to be average sound quality, which is disappointing at that price point. ","361":"> Curious how you know the driver is the same as on the earpod. Apple doesn't release that info.\nI disagree. It seems that Apple has released that info, as seen in the Verge's review, where they say the following:\n\"Apple claims the audio components are virtually the same between the two products (...)\"\nSo there you go, you're paying premium money for features you don't have access to, as the audio components clearly aren't high-grade.\n\nIt would be easier for you to just google stuff like \"Best wireless earphones\" and such, but i can name a few which i would personally much rather get.\n\n\n-  Samsung Gear IconX 2nd gen. \n\nThe 2nd gen has a MUCH improved battery life, and ontop of that these headphones are incredibly feature-packed and water resistant, and you can also use those features with your android smartphone. \nHere is a quote from Tom's guide's review regarding battery life.\n> The biggest problem we had with the original Gear IconX was its battery life, which clocked in at a paltry 90 minutes;. (...) Samsung sacrificed the heart rate sensor to extend the battery to 5 hours of Bluetooth streaming and 7 hours of local music playback.\n\n- jaybird X3\n\nThese are just a classic recommendation, as they're a good bang for your buck.\n\n- Beoplay E8 \n\nThese are exciting new earphones, which are created by the renowned Bang & Olufsen, so sound quality should be great. Furthermore, they're pretty featured packed. I have auditioned these myself, but for a brief moment, so not long enough to make a judgement, but they definitely did not sound bad\n\n- Bose SoundSport free wireless earbuds\n\nI would like to note that i heavily dislike the Airpods, as they are \"earbuds\" and by that i mean earphones that literally just hang in your ear. They don't offer any isolation at all, which i heavily dislike, as it means that every single noise will disrupt my music. This could lead to me turning up the volume, in order to actually hear my music properly over the outside noise, which could damage my hearing with time. Additionally, earbuds don't isolate the other way either, meaning other people will easily be able to hear your music, if you turn it a little bit up. Therefore earphones that actually have silicone\/foam tips that go into your ear and isolate is much better, imo. If you want to hear the outside tho, then i think that both the Gear IconX and the Beoplay E8 has a feature that allows the outside noise to come through the earphones.\n\nEdit: Apparently I'm downvoted for going above and beyond, when it comes to recommending alternatives. I suppose opinions that aren't pro-airpods really are damaging for people here. ","362":"... I wasn't talking about power cycling at all, just daily charging since they only last a few hours.","363":"Yeah. I love using wired headphones as the connection is flawless and power is no issue on that end. I have found what seem like good wireless headphones and will test out the purported battery life to see if it matches my use case. I generally won't mind too much if something will last at least a day because I aim to charge things every night.\n\nIf my 6P gives up and I have to go with a phone missing a jack for a stupid arbitrary reason then I should test out my options while I still have the option of both. I know about using a dongle but we really should be beyond that by now.\n\nWireless headphones do have some advantages but having another device reliant on a battery isn't ideal. What I really don't like is not having an easy choice between them. Google has been tending to remove more options recently for the sake of simplicity. Hangouts losing SMS integration, removing the headphone jack, that kind of thing.","364":"We're looking for different things. I don't want sound isolation.\n\nI had the X3 and beoplay and they are still wired. Bose looks interesting I'll check them out.\n\nHave a nice weekend dude","365":"If you don't want sound isolation, afaik the Beoplay E8 and Gear IconX 2nd gens also have modes to let in outside noise, so that could solve the issue.\n\nThe X3 and Beoplay E8 isn't wired. The Jaybird X3 earphones are connected to each other with a wire tho, but not a wire to the source. The Beoplay E8 is not wired at all tho, not even between the earphones, they're completely wireless.\n\nYou also said you had the Beoplay. Do you mean have alrdy owned the Beoplay E8? I would be pretty shocked if that's what you mean, as they were released very recently.\n\nIf you only accept earbuds tho, then Airpods is essentially the only option, as no other company is crazy enough to make expensive earbuds.
