Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering.

We both have Google Pixel 8 Pros. Has anyone had any connection issues. It seems that it pairs to the car but doesnt actually connect. Any help out there?  UPDATE UPDATE!! GREAT NEWS! JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on\/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on\/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too. So theres definitely something with the new android jan update that has worked for me. I have also noticed that the BT connection is solid with out any skips or jitters.Give it a go.","41":"Pixel 9 Pro XL: Overpriced and Underwhelming in Europe?+I'm really confused about what to do and whether it's worth continuing to use Pixel devices. I was keen on purchasing the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the European prices are just insane. On top of that, in most European countries, we'll have a crippled device. To make matters worse, the phone will be priced above the S24 Ultra, which has almost all these features.

I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u\/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate. I very much dislike that this is how it's done but I'm glad my info was not exposed to a bad actor.My apologies folks.","58":"I've had THREE Google Pixels completely crap out on me in less than a year. Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ","59":"Your Google Store order was cancelled+**Auto Cancellations:**  Last week, I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL with Preferred Care and a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, but 24 hours later, my order was automatically canceled. Thinking I had made a mistake, I reordered, but it was canceled again. When I contacted support, they gave me a non-detailed response, citing \"violation of sales terms\" as the reason for the cancellation. When I asked for more details, they repeated the same phrase and hung up.**Cause:**  The next day, I called again, but they hung up on me despite my polite approach. This time, they mentioned it might be an issue with my payment method, although I regularly use the same card for purchases. I tried again with a different card and made some changes to the order details, but the order was canceled once more. Eventually, I reached someone who went through the payment method with me step by step. They suggested various potential issues, like my name being incorrect or missing tax information (which isn't required)! I asked to speak to a manager, and two days later, I received a generic email from someone named \"Sam\" at store-support, once again citing \"violation of sales terms\" without further explanation.**Resolution:**  After doing some research online, I found that **changing the shipping address might solve the issue**. I used my spouse\u2019s work address, and six hours later, the phone was shipped and delivered the next day.","60":"Another victim of phones being stolen in transit+**11-27-24 Update** \\- Google has finally come to their senses and issued me a refund.  I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8\/28.  On 8\/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.  At this point I'm posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven't thought of or tried to this point.","61":"Purchased a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold that has been stolen by delivery driver - Google refusing to help+Posting on here as I\u2019m finding myself out of options.The short version is that I was waiting in for a new Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold today when the UK delivery company DPD updated me that the item had been delievered.The picture taken is clearly amongst other parcels, not my house.

The name is a misspelling of my own.I've chased up with DPD who said they will investigate the driver but can't help with the parcel. They advised me to raise a 'parcel search investigation' with Google, but advisors on both the phone and live chat state that since it's been delivered \"our job is done\" - no joke, I\u2019m just being told tough luck, thanks for the money.I actually used klarna through the Google store, which strangely doesn\u2019t seem to have debited me yet, but even their services seem to suggest \u201cask Google\u201d. Feeling very down about this whole situation and tempted to never buy from Google again after how they\u2019ve handled this. Can anyone please help advise what to do next as a UK customer?\u2014\u2014UPDATE: For those interested or in a similar situation, I\u2019m now three days in and the Google agents I\u2019ve spoken to have all refused to help - even the manager that had the issue escalated. I\u2019ve got screenshots of them literally saying \u201cwe did our job, if you\u2019re unhappy contact the courier\u201d.A payment has now been taken by Klarna, despite me flagging this problem. I\u2019ve now started a dispute with Klarna directly to try and help challenge the issues I\u2019m having with Google. I\u2019ve never known bad customer service like this before.UPDATE 2: Thank you to PixelCommunity for reaching out and helping me to speedily resolve this in the end. It was a nightmare customer experience but posting here definitely made it a little more bearable.
