Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ","92":"Features Missing after the December Feature Drop (Pixel 9 Pro)+As the title suggests, I'm missing the following features on my phone:1. No Pixel Studio Stickers on my Gboard2. No Pixel Screenshots implementation I'm circle to search.3. No Improved Haptic Feedback as mentioned by a redditor in the recent update.4. Can't see battery temps in the settings.5. Absence of the new Live Captions.Anyone else having the same problem?","93":"Pixels Buds Pro 2 Find My Device is worthless+I pre-ordered the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and received them last week. I love them overall. However I forgot them at work the other day and when I got home I attempted to locate them and it said they were last seen at home. I got to work the next day, and it still couldn't locate them. They were sitting directly next to me, but could not be located until I actually opened the case to connect them to my phone. I feel like that is pretty useless. If I don't know where the things are, how can I open it to connect them first? Am I fundamentally misunderstanding the point of Locate My Device? I feel like it should tell me where my device is when I DONT know where it is. Not when I am holding it.","94":"Pixel Buds Pro 2: one of the buds suddenly loses sound, while being connected, and randomly comes back, or not+I've been looking here for other reports, but I didn't see anything really similar to this issue.  However, a few people seem to experience it too, see here:[report on r\/pixelbuds](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pixelbuds\/comments\/1ik6yqx\/pixel_buds_pro_2_randomly_one_of_the_ear_buds\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) To keep it simple, while playing sound, usually music, my left bud suddenly stops playing. Sound keeps playing on the right one, and both stay connected to my phone (Pixel 8a, latest stable version, Android 15). Touching the bud still pauses the music, noise cancellation still works, but no sound. It sometimes comes back if I pause, then play, then pause multiple times or play with random settings such as noise cancellation, but sometimes the only workaround is to put it back in the suitcase for a few seconds. Also, both buds seems a bit slow to process commands when it happens.  It can happen 4 times a day and then no issue another day. Did a factory reset, nothing changed. It seems like it appeared after the last update (release 3.144).Anyone has been experiencing this?","95":"If we have a Pixel Watch fully charged alert, why can't we have a Pixel Buds fully charged alert?+This seems like an obvious and simple enhancement. ","96":"How to get 30% off pixel phone+EDIT 3 read first: spent a silly amount of time on Google support chat being bounced around, and it's highly likely from their response and a few replies here that gold status on play store no longer gives the 30% coupon. However, there's still a benefit here... Read edit 2 below. I've used price match before and had no issues. Thanks to u\/justyoursimplenameEdit 2: u\/justyoursimplename mentioned price match through Bestbuy, which is $250 vs $150. Not the $329 that the 30% would give. Been about 12 hours since I did the get to gold info on play store below, and no coupon yet... -Currently it's only $150 off on pixel phones. You however get a 30% off with gold in play store.If you don't have gold, you can sign up for play pass on Google Play currently for $2.99 a month (trial won't work). Then you open it and trigger the upgrade to gold, and it takes you to gold immediately. I'm waiting to see how long before the coupon shows up as I just did this on my wife's account since I used mine up buy my p9pxl. Once you get the coupon it will save you double over the current promo.-11 hours since sign up and no coupon yet... Based on comments sounding not super likely, so not sure how long I'll wait, maybe to the current promo expiration date on Pixel.Needless to say if you can't afford to throw away three dollars it may not be worth the gamble to save double on the thousand plus dollar phone you're looking to buy...-Edit. Play Pass subscribers in France, Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom will now be eligible to receive Gold level benefits on Google Play Points. [Full details](https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/answer\/14673382?hl=en)Btw, don't forget to consider upgrading Google one to the plan that gives you 10% store credit (30 days after ship) on Google store purchases. I still have leftover credit from my 7s, but I read it now expires in a year so plan accordingly. I'm putting off the buds pro two upgrades for a month to be sure I can use the credit on something I want from the store. ","97":"Worst experience I have had with a phone (Pixel 9)+The pixel 9 has been a nightmare for me and I need to vent.I bought my pixel 9 two months ago and after about a month, it has had terrible software crashing and restarting issues. I asked google pixel support what I can do about this and they said to bring it to a repair shop. The repair shop said to send it to google because it was out of their scope. So I send it to Google and they say there are no issues! great! So they send it back and obviously the same issues happen again.Now I am in the process of sending it back for a replacement, and they are sending me a refurbished phone and not a new one, so I spent $600 on a refurbished phone essentially. I don't care if its refurbished, but should I not get some compensation for their faulty device not working? Instead I am punished for their mistake. I really wouldn't mind if I just got some compensation, even like $100 google store credit or something to get some ear buds.I have had some very cheap phones before this and I thought \"now that I have some money I'll finally buy a luxury phone.\" But this has somehow been the worst phone I've had.Never buying a device from Google after this, they very quickly lost my trust.","98":"Pixel 6a - Can someone confirm I CANNOT plug my phone into my monitor via HDMI? +Hi all,I have a PC monitor I'd like to connect my phone via HDMI cable to the monitor, so I can view things bigger.I was about to purchase a USB C to HDMI cable on Amazon, but after some googling people are saying that Pixel's can't do this?Before I burn my money, can someone confirm that the pixel 6a CANNOT be plugged into a spare HDMI monitor?

Granted, I haven't tested this on an iPhone, but it works on my macbook.","101":"Improvements that would make the pixel a top contender in the phone market+Don't get me wrong, the pixel is a good phone with lots of cool features and convienient for people since everyone uses at least 1 google service. But there's a lot of stuff that the pixel needs to implement which I think would make it 100x better.1. Revamp the control center and make it similar to what iOS and oneui 7 are doing. Swipe left for notifications and swipe right for control center. I think the control center looks a bit ugly.  2. Better lockscreen customization. The pixel falls behind in lockscreen customizations compared to apple and samsung. First, they should add widgets to the lockscreen as well as specific places to put the clock etc. in the center and stuff like that3. Make minimum volume more quiet. I sleep with my brother and want to watch something but putting it on the lowest volume slider still makes it very loud in a quiet bedroom since it wakes him up. On my iPad, the volume is just right4. Ability to disable mobile data usage for certain apps (for the people with low data amounts). My brother plays this game called block blast which shoudn't use any data at all but its still consuming data and in large amounts too. Brands like apple, samsung, oneplus, xiaomi and more all have thios feature but for some reason the pixel just doesn't have it (I don't need disabling data in the background, I want it to be disabled in the foreground)5. Transparent navigation and status bars. Most apps like chrome make the gesture navigation bar surrounded by a huge grey box which is very annoying and not aesthetically pleasing. Same thing for status bar but I can't remember which apps display either a grey or black box around it. 6. Ability to make bigger status bar icons (without making text look bigger). I know how to increase the icon size but it makes everything else look a lot bigger which I don't want it to. Make a specific setting which changes how big the icons appear or make the icons bigger by default like iOS. 7. (optional feature) Make face unlock use the same sensors as the iphone and make it work in low light areas as well as wearing accessories like sunglasses or masks since its very bad in those senarios. It only works in the dark sometimes.  The thing that really ticks me off is the control center and lock screen customizations. The pixel would be the really good after these stuff.

The new one works perfectly. So if you have this problem, send the phone in for repair. Hey!So i bought the phone in november 2023 and the strange behavior started about 2 weeks ago.**Before the stange behavior:**  Until 2 weeks ago, the phone could take about 28-29w charge (I have a LCD-screen on the cable) and it was a steady charge, and as the battery fills up the wattage drops, completely normal.**Problem description:**  Let's say i got 5% left in the phone, connect the charger, and it says ''Charge rapidly'' but keeps disconnecting and reconnect. And the wattage on the LCD-cable says 20w, down to 0w, up to 20 w and so it proceed all the way up to 100%.I have tried 5 different cables, and 3 walladapter, who's all support PD\/PPS-charging. And the problem persist with all of them...**Video of the behavior**: [https:\/\/streamable.com\/8snywy](https:\/\/streamable.com\/8snywy)Have Google change something in the last two weeks so Google Pixel 8 Pro must have Google:s original 30w charger?On my wife's Pixel 7, this behavior doesn't exist.**Google:s response:**  They said that the technical team could not find any problem and sent the phone back to me and left it at that.I have contacted Google again, but the conversation seems like AI-driven and that i'm not talking to an human.**What should i do?****\\*Beware** of typos or gammatical errors, as English isn't my native language.

They will randomly just stop showing up as an output option, even though they are showing in the Bluetooth menu as (Connected, Audio) and they have an earbuds icon. That shows that windows recognizes them as an audio device and a headset, yet they still won't play sound. I'll have to put them away and take them out of the case to fix this. Hoping to hear from others that have tried the new buds on Windows machines, how did it go for you guys? Any issues and\/or solutions you've discovered? Do you think this is normal because they just came out or something weird with my setup? I have tried two different bluetooth modules to pair them to and trouble occurs with both.Unrelated, but also when I grip them to twist into a tight fit in my ear, they make a painful squeaking noise, wtf?So far these are somehow worse than the $130 OnePlus Buds Pro 3sEdit: After a factory reset, I am now getting telephone quality sound.

","140":"The P9P XL's vapor chamber cooling is actually pretty good.+**That** ***Wired*** **Article**Earlier, I saw a [Wired article](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/review\/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl\/) posted here where the author mentioned that he played nearly 2 hours of Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) with maxed settings and didn't see it stuttering that much.I thought that there was no way this was true, so as an avid player of the game (yes, that's where the ZZZ in my name comes from), I tried it out on my new P9P XL. There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions. Happy to answer them.","141":"Heads up: 10% off Google Store email+It looks like Google is sending out 10% off coupons to certain Pixel 9 owners for use on some accessories. But here's the thing, it works on devices as well, even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, bringing it down $180. The subject of the email is \"A 10% Google Store offer, just for you\".[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/R4o2OIX](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/R4o2OIX)[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/A89Br4y](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/A89Br4y)","142":"Did Google just remove the \"stop\" voice command feature to verbally dismiss alarms?+I could've sworn I just used this feature a couple days ago - it's one of my top 5 features about the Pixel.There are so many times where I find myself with inaccessible hands during the time my alarm goes off each night to remind me to give my dog his meds, like when I washing dishes, cleaning, or eating and my hands are dirty. Being able to just say \"stop\" is **so convenient**.I have a Google Pixel 9 Pro. I just checked - I don't have any app, security, or system updates. Did Google dark launch this feature - was it available to everyone or just a select few? Is it a bug that it doesn't work anymore? Is it just me or has this happened to others also?Sometimes I get so frustrated when new features just stop working and we just have to hope that Google fixes it.  ## \u2705 Edit - Solved!  Thanks to the comments (especially u\/FlowEasyDelivers and u\/EddieRyanDC), I was able to figure out what happened and it's fixed now!CharGPT was down the other day, so I tried Gemini on my phone, and in order to use it, Google forced me to switch to it over from Google Assistant as my phone's main voice assistant.So far I haven't seen any other side-effects from it, but it seems that one side-effect is it somehow toggled off the setting that allows using the \"stop\" verbal command - I think because it's under \"Google Assistant\" settings. **If you open up the system settings (not the Clock app settings) and search for \"Quick Phrases\", there's a toggle for \"Alarms and Timers.\" Re-enabling this toggle worked for me.**Initially I could not find this support article by googling my question, but in that settings screen they link to the following which is helpful. Apparently you can also say \"snooze\" and a few other things:https:\/\/support.google.com\/assistant\/answer\/9475056?visit_id=638712199693618716-1562011154&p=quick_phrases&rd=1#complete_tasks","143":"Weak GPS Performance from Pixel 9 Pro XL+I hike often and record my tracks, finding the Pixel 7 Pro to be fairly accurate and consistent. After upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I noticed frequent, anomalous readings -- spurs, backtracking, [wild swings in elevation](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FhLoN5p.png), etc. When stopped, the phone will think you're constantly moving back and forth. This can increase distance calculations by 15%+ and looks terrible.* [Crossing an unobstructed ridge in a straight line](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/G4kOfI4).* [Crossing another ridge, high above treeline](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qMDghkk.png)* [Wild swings](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/T6LriJw.png)I have dozens of recordings with these issues, and they've persisted with various settings. If anything, it slightly improves when the phone is in power-saving mode, but it's not huge.I did [side-by-side comparison on a south-facing slope with no trees or other obstructions](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/30bZDHP). The P9PXL (black line) is off track and takes weird loops and spurs when compared the P7P (purple). For reference, the Garmin Fenix 7X smartwatch (solid red line) is by far the most accurate, even though the P7P is close.Has anyone else experienced this? I'm hoping it's a software issue and not a design flaw or broken hardware.","144":"IOS annoying me - considering pixel 9 pro xl+Hi all, The recent IOS update has my aging IPhone XS Max lagging between transitioning from camera to texts, between apps, or even trying to share something. The whole phone has basically just slowed down since the last update and it\u2019s annoying to say the least. I got an email from google about a $100 off a pixel phone so looking into that. How do the video camera functions seem quality wise? I primary shoot YouTube videos on my phone and edit via CapCut. I also like the scalability of the storage on androids as my iPhone teeters between big videos. Just typing this out, I was typing faster than the phone could post the text.. and nothing but the IOS update (storage is fine) is causing this. ","145":"Bug - Volume Buttons suddenly can't snooze Alarms+*** EDITED to say: I spoke too soon regarding a fix - I thought it was fixed by an update to the Google app today, February 3rd - but the bug returned February 4th ***For years, I've snoozed my Clock alarm by pressing the physical volume buttons, but a day or so ago it stopped working. I've searched for answers to this bug and found the suggestion to turn off Google Assistant Quick Phrases, which does seem to fix the problem, but then I lose the Quick Phrases functionality.The weird thing is, this bug doesn't occur on my husband's Pixel 9 Pro, which is pretty much the same as mine, same carrier and everything. It also doesn't occur on my old Pixel 8 which is currently only on Wi-Fi and under my same Google account as my Pixel 9 Pro. Any other suggestions for how to fix this issue? I tried deleting all data and updates from the Clock app itself but that didn't fix anything.","146":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from Google Store has been lost\/stolen by delivery drivers. No help from Google!+I am posting here as a last resort as I have already tried to get support from Google through various channels - including their live chat, telephone support, Twitter support. They just reiterate the same copy-pasted responses without actually understanding the issue. I have also tried to DM PixelCommunity here on Reddit as well as opened a ticket on dmziggy's Reddit Request form and also DM'ed him directly, receiving no response from all of these channels.I have now turned to post here as I have seen others have had their issues resolved or rectified after posting here and following the subsequent exposure to their issues. Seems Google does not care unless there is an outcry.To summarise what happened, I ordered a the 9 Pro XL directly from Google Store with an estimated delivery date of 22nd August (I have ordered the 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, Buds, Tablet etc all before with no issues). When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it. Therefore, I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold, the phone was not in the actual phone box, and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the space.I immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them. They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there. When I contact DPD, they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and they'll have to rectify\/correct.Google Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and they've ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week. Can somebody please assist or help what I should do from here as a UK customer? I do not want to do a chargeback as I have EVERYTHING on my Google account so do not want to risk losing it all.TLDR: Phone stolen\/lost from inside delivery box (images taken and sent to Google). Zero assistance or support from Google store on all their support channels over the past 3 weeks. Need advice on what do as a UK customer, feeling extremely helpless.","147":"Any fixes for Pixel 9 Pro\/XL wireless charging issues?+Have there been any improvements made on this? We have Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and they exhibit inconsistent charging behavior on a variety of magsafe and qi chargers, with cases on and off. I see lots of documented issues here and on Google support forum dating back to launch.Ours will sometimes charge very slow or cycle from charging to not charging repeatedly. I have found a home charger that works at 8w (Pixel Stand 1) and 1 random magsafe car charger that seems to work ok at 4w or so after trying many. I monitor charge rate with Ampere.We previously had 2 Pixel 7 Pros entirely lose wireless charging ability (months apart) before upgrading to Pixel 9 Pros...I feel like I'm being punked.Software issue? Hardware issue? What gives???","148":"I'm disappointed - Pixel 9+Hello everyone. I've been using a P9 for about a month. I'm coming from a 4 years old Oneplus 8. Overall, the phone is ok, it takes great photos, but other than that and the great build quality\/design it didn't feel like much of an upgrade. I just needed a new phone because the Oneplus battery got quite fried.My issues with the phone:1. Android auto calls have no sound & microphone doesn't work. Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum.2. Apps are always killed in the background, any app. Can't keep anything running in the background (very annoying while gaming - I'm playing PUBG). I tried enabling background usage for specific apps, it didn't make a difference. This wasn't an issue on the OP83. Buttons placement4. Bottom speaker placement - it should have been on the other side of the charging port in my opinion in order to not get muffled while watching content in landscape mode.5. Charging speed is slow even compared to my 2020 Oneplus 86. It gets hot quite easily7. Battery life is not consistent, varies from one day to another8. No way to turn off the screen other than the power button (double tap on home screen for example)9. Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10. Google photos is annoying and bad - its sole purpose is to make you purchase google drive storage11. Screen borders (bezel) too thick - compared to my 2020 OP812. Call sounds routing to headphones.When the call is ended the sound is routed to phone speakers for 2 seconds, you only hear the call ending tone in the phone speakers, not in the headphones. This is not such a big deal, but it just shows how much attention Google put into the basics of this phone - not too much.Considering all of these I'm thinking about returning the phone (I have 60 day return policy). My question here is: how many of these issues, mainly the software related ones (1, 2, 12), are also present on the P9 Pro? I like the phone overall and I would be willing to make a compromise and get the 9 Pro for the great camera and the long term support if some of these issues are not present. Otherwise I will just wait for the Oneplus 13 to be available in Europe. Thanks!","149":"Done with Google products +Pixel 7 Pro, purchased August 2023. About an hour ago, I reached for my phone, attached to its genuine Google charger with its genuine cable as usual. I thought my phone cover was coming off, but I found the battery swollen! I immediately went to Google support, and they said it's out of warranty. The Asurion repair center wants $99 for repair, but they don't have the battery in stock. The phone is almost paid off and I had planned to go with a Pixel 9 Pro in April. Now, I would rather use two tin cans and a string then waste money on another Google product. I am IT Manager for my company and this will also influence my decision when upgrading our 24 company Pixel 5 phones this summer. Samsung, I never should have left you.

I have been through several Android smartphones, from Samsung Galaxy S2 to OnePlus7. I have been through them all. Although I wasn't very happy with all Android smartphones, I personally feel my OnePlus7 purchase was the best.The reason why I love Android because I hate ads and on Android I can root my smartphone and block ads at a DNS level. That's the only reason I never moved to an iPhone.I love stock Android and prefer to install lineage but as with all third party ROMs, some functionality or the other gets broken. Hence, this time I decided to buy a Pixel as it would come with a stock ROM and the only thing I would need to do is root my smartphone and install an ad blocking apk thereby creating the perfect device.I bought the Pixel 8 on September 2023 and I truly regret my purchase. It is an absolute piece of garbage and the entire Pixel team in Google should honestly be sorry for creating such a piece of garbage. The below are my issues with Pixel 8.1. Heating - This phone heats like crazy when I use it on 5G. One of the reasons I upgraded to Pixel 8 from OnePlus 7 was because OnePlus 7 did not support 5G. However, after seeing the heating issue on 5G, I was forced to keep my device on LTE which negated the whole purpose of buying this device. I suspect some of this heating has to do with Google's tensor chip which is very subpar compared to Apple's in house SoC and even Qualcomm's SoC. I don't know they developed tensor? Just because Apple has their own SoC, I guess?2. Lag and bugs - Several popular apps such as Swiggy (food delivery app in India) and other apps lag like crazy on this device. This issue has been confirmed by others as well. There is a random bug on instagram which causes brightness to increase to max for certain reels which is very weird to say the least.3. Build and screen size - Screen size is smaller and build is heftier than usual. I hate holding this device. At a time when other manufacturers have moved towards less bezel and more display, Google has gone the opposite way.4. App switcher button not working - This is the craziest bug of them all. The app switch button simply doesn't work. I have realized that this has been a recurrent issue with Pixel phones and something Google simply refuses to address? I mean what kind of snobby head in their a\\*\\*\\* kind of engineers does Google have that they simply do not address such a simple bug for years together? Even low quality Chinese OEMs do a better job at fixing simple bugs like these on their device and here we have the \"flagship\" Google phone for which there is no fix. I pay iPhone equivalent price for such a piece of shit.5. Useless AI gimmicks - Instead of nailing down the basics of what makes a good phone, Google has decided to stuff it with useless AI gimmicks which 99% of people are never going to use. I have personally not used a single one of them.WORST OF IT ALL COMES BELOW.5. After sales service - There is literally negligible after sales service for Pixel, at least in India. I started seeing a pink line on my display and gave it to the service center which is authorized by Google. Anyone wants to guess the TAT? 15 DAYS !!! Yes, not 15 hours, 15 DAYS. There is no replacement device provided and the service center is a third party center which doesn't even pick my calls on most days and all Google reviews for Pixel for this service center is 1 star. For my OnePlus7, the battery had worn off and they replaced the same within 2 hours. Just 2 hours. That's it.Conclusion - I made a blunder spending $700 on Pixel 8 over here in India. It is half my monthly salary. I don't even know if I will ever get my phone back from the service center, even if I do, I don't want to use it for more than a year before I switch to iPhone for good. I will watch some ads but at least I will have a much better phone to use.  Edit - The downvotes are crazy, it is because of die hard fanboys like you that Google and its Pixel team gets away with such a shitty phone. If this were a third party OEM who built such a phone at such a price, they would be bankrupt by now. Anyhow, keep funding the snobs at Google. I personally, am done.","155":"No audio through Android Auto (Pixel 9 Pro XL)+Edit:  SOLVED!  u\/Squintz82 posted [this](https:\/\/support.google.com\/androidauto\/thread\/312020339\/no-audio-via-android-auto-after-december-2024-feature-drop?hl=en) which lead me in the right direction of what to enable.

This is when things started to go south.Once in Canada she no longer had T-Mobile service despite other family members with iPhones on the same plan having service. When she returned to the US she still had no service. Her sim card seemed fine and worked on other phones. We eventually contact T-Mobile and they tell us that they blocked the phone from service because the phone has been marked as stolen. T-Mobile told us that Google marked the phone as stolen.We contact Google support and they know nothing about the phone being marked as stolen. They tell us to contact T-Mobile again. We tell T-Mobile that Google knows nothing and it becomes a finger pointing game. Eventually my mother gets service again but that only lasted for a few days.My mother tried going to another phone company, Visible, and they said they couldn't service the phone because it was marked as stolen.

My mother has had to use her sister's phone to make phone calls and she's talked to a million people who do not really know how to help.Since the phone was not working for whatever reason, my mother attempted to return it and get a replacement phone. The issue was that she did not want to pay the price of a new phone for a refurbished phone. This is a phone that she had for about less than a month I believe.Google Support refused to send a new phone and sent a refurbished phone instead. After a lot of back and forth with support they also refused to give any kind of discount or refund any money.My mother decided reject the shipment of the refurbished phone from Fedex and has attempted to pursue the route of trying to get a full refund. Synchrony won't refund anything until Google has approved the refund and she received an email today saying they would not issue the refund. She emailed back and now they are talking about \"escalating.\"My mother is at a point where she is wanting to pursue legal assistance. What can we do? She now has no phone and a bill to pay.

MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now reports that it contains over 70,000 messages. (Although if I view the backup in the app, it lists only around 50,000 messages, so maybe something is kinda broken.)(2)  You cannot see images and videos when you view the conversation details from within a specific chat thread.(3)  If you open an image from the search bar in Google Messages and tap \u201cSee in chat\u201d, it\u2019ll bring you to a random chat thread (mine brings me to a 2FA text thread from Lowe\u2019s, for every picture I\u2019ve tried).\u00a0 When I go to \\[...\\] > Details in that thread, all the images show up; however, they don\u2019t actually appear in the thread, only in that Details screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the 5-digit phone number for these 2FA codes may be the first to appear numerically in the database?(4)  [This article](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/08\/23\/pixel-9-google-messages-rcs-transfer\/) suggests updating your old device to the beta version of Google Messages before doing the transfer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do that and think it\u2019s ridiculous that it should be necessary.**CONCLUSION:**It appears that Google Messages is now integral to the transfer process, presumably because they\u2019re trying to transfer RCS messages as-is.\u00a0 After the transfer, you\u2019ll see that your Google Messages app storage consumes multiple GB while your Phone and Messaging Storage app database consumes almost nothing.\u00a0 Normally, the latter is at least a few GB because that\u2019s where MMS \/ text media are stored.\u00a0 Over time, things seem to migrate from the Google Messages app storage into the Phone and Messaging Storage app, but there are still bugs, as described above.","161":"8a microphone recording muffled sound+This just started in the last week or so. I've had the phone for a couple of months. Now when I use the camera app to record a video the audio that it records is horribly muffled, like I have to put the volume up to max to hear what it recorded and even then it's quiet and sounds awful. It sounds the same when recording sound in the Recorder app, and the same when recording video in the Open Camera app. The speakers are fine. I can play music on Spotify or Youtube and it sounds as normal.So far I've:\\-restarted the phone\\-uninstalled the most recent Camera app update\\-disabled and re-enabled microphone permissions in the Camera app\\-disabled and re-enabled the Camera app\\-ran through all of the Pixel audio diagnostics (top microphone seems to be recording sounds more muffled than the bottom microphone)\\-restarted the phone in safe mode and recorded audio in all apps again\\-cleared cache and deleted data in the Camera appNone of these have made any difference so far.

Not all pixel phones will face this. Just some users like me. It's is a software bug after updating to Android 15 with some of the devices, not a device problem or actual issue with the update.. So don't blame Google or your network provider.There have been many fixes which are pointless and time consuming like mobile network reset, Factory Reset, sim swap, eSIM conversion. It's not related. If you go to.. System..Reset Options.. Reset Mobile Network Settings..The phone will show 5G but temporary.When you place a  call, it will switch to LTE and after disconnection doesn't switch back to 5G.You have to do Network Reset every time to get 5G connectivity.Now the Permanent FIX...Thank me later..Go to Settings..

Reset Mobile Network Settings..You'll get 5G network...then place a call it'll switch to LTE and disconnect.This time Phone will switch back to 5G normally without any issue.. \ud83c\udf7bYou can text or comment here if you need some clarification...                     ................EDIT:  ISSUE RETURNED BACK AFTER 12 HOURS.When I plug in the charger, 5G comes back... Strange..Had to factory reset the phone.. still the same.Now called my carrier (JIO) for proper provisioning.. and for now seems stable.Let's see what happens next..Final Edit: I entered the repair mode and there was no such issue so figured that some app or settings might be causing the problem and finally figured the issue..Can you believe.. The issue in my case is because I had kept Battery Saver On.I turned it off and phone returned to 5G without any problem..Have to contact Phone Support to close my case as they are working on it.So.. to all facing the issue.. Battery Saver will Keep your Phone in LTE mode only. Cheers....

I bought this phone when it first came out (October 2023), so it\u2019s been about a year. The moment I updated to Android 15, my Bluetooth completely stopped working. I\u2019m talking completely unresponsive, no way to turn it on, nothing.I reached out to Google Support, and they had me go through all the basic troubleshooting steps. Resetting Bluetooth and network settings? Done. Restarting the phone? Tried it. Safe mode? Tried it. Nothing worked. The Bluetooth just stayed dead, and I\u2019m left thinking, \u201cWhat now?\u201dThen, they suggested a factory reset. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about this, but they basically said they couldn\u2019t help me unless I did it. So, I went ahead and reset the entire phone\u2014still no luck. Called support again, and at this point, they had no new solutions for me. I\u2019m stuck.To make matters worse, my warranty had expired, and they told me that getting this \u201cupdate issue\u201d fixed would cost around $500 at an official Google shop\u2014half the price of the phone! When I pushed back, saying this was clearly a software issue from their update, they offered me a 20% discount on a new phone. Really?Desperate for a fix, I even opted into the Android beta program, hoping maybe it would resolve the issue. Instead, it made things worse. My phone now restarts five or six times daily, and the Bluetooth is still dead. And if I want to downgrade back to Android 15, I\u2019d have to wipe all my data completely. I\u2019m basically stuck with a glitchy, rebooting phone and no Bluetooth\u2014and Google has no real solution for me.So now, here I am, with a month of no Bluetooth on my Pixel 8 Pro, random reboots, no help from Google, and a really bad taste in my mouth. I\u2019ve been a Google user for years, but this experience with their Pixel lineup might just push me over to Apple.Any others out there facing similar issues? Would love to hear your experiences.","167":"[Bug] Pixel 9 Pro Fold - Locking phone\/switching alls mutes microphone+Hi allI'm encountering an annoying bug that happens often but not always:Whenever I call someone (regular phone\/Whatsapp) the phone mutes my microphone when locking the phone, and\/or switching to a different app. As soon as I do any of these action, the green \"hot mic\"- dot in the upper right corner disappears until I switch back to the phone app\/Whatsapp and people on the other end can't hear me anymore.When someone calls me instead, it works fine.

Any tips?","211":"Pixel 9 Pro not receiving notifications when on mobile data +","212":"Official Google support rep tried to phish my account+***See bottom update, turns out the verification prompt was legit and how Google does things.***Hey folks,I posted this on r\/Scams but I figured it was warranted to share here as well given this began through the built in support system on my pixel 9 pro.Sooooo, I went through the tips & support menu of my new pixel 9 pro and requested a callback regarding pixel 4a appeasement issues (trying to switch from pixel store credit to either the cash or battery repair of my 4a). I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u\/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate. I very much dislike that this is how it's done but I'm glad my info was not exposed to a bad actor.My apologies folks.","213":"I've had THREE Google Pixels completely crap out on me in less than a year. Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ","214":"Your Google Store order was cancelled+**Auto Cancellations:**  Last week, I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL with Preferred Care and a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, but 24 hours later, my order was automatically canceled. Thinking I had made a mistake, I reordered, but it was canceled again. When I contacted support, they gave me a non-detailed response, citing \"violation of sales terms\" as the reason for the cancellation. When I asked for more details, they repeated the same phrase and hung up.**Cause:**  The next day, I called again, but they hung up on me despite my polite approach. This time, they mentioned it might be an issue with my payment method, although I regularly use the same card for purchases. I tried again with a different card and made some changes to the order details, but the order was canceled once more. Eventually, I reached someone who went through the payment method with me step by step. They suggested various potential issues, like my name being incorrect or missing tax information (which isn't required)! I asked to speak to a manager, and two days later, I received a generic email from someone named \"Sam\" at store-support, once again citing \"violation of sales terms\" without further explanation.**Resolution:**  After doing some research online, I found that **changing the shipping address might solve the issue**. I used my spouse\u2019s work address, and six hours later, the phone was shipped and delivered the next day.","215":"Another victim of phones being stolen in transit+**11-27-24 Update** \\- Google has finally come to their senses and issued me a refund.  I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8\/28.  On 8\/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.  At this point I'm posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven't thought of or tried to this point.","216":"Phone issue - call straight to VM and texts coming in clumps+I am a Verizon customer and there doesn't seem to be outages or other issues in our area, but my phone and my wife's phone (both Pixel 7 Pro) have been sending calls straight to voicemail and not pushing texts through except for in clumps throughout the day. All the sudden I will receive a notification for four voicemails all indicating that my phone didn't ring, and text responses for 10+ individuals\/groups from a previous two to three hours period in which I received no texts. This has happened consistently for the past 7-10 days. I have word of mouth experiences from other Verizon customers that they aren't having issues (iPhone and Galaxy users) who get a similar call\/text load to me through our job (also same geographical area, which is Twin Cities metro, Minnesota). It could be an android issue or a specifically bad iPhone to android issue, but it appears to only be happening to our phones. Verizon and Google customer service were no help, but I feel like it has to be some kind of issue with a recent update based on the nature of the problem and my past history. I have noticed regular issues with this phone where periods of high group-text or individual text frequency result in a delay to messaging for a handful of minutes in the past (maybe 15-20 at the max with a click of the \"fix connectivity\" option correcting immediately, but that is specifically a messaging issue where this seems to be a problem with any phone to phone mobile network and WiFi communication. I have power cycled several times, tried different areas of my house (and different geographical locations), tried the \"fix connectivity\" button, and reported to both Verizon and Google. Any similar problems? My wife found a thread where an AT&T user had a similar issue in the same time frame. Any fix or similar reported issue would be helpful.  Thank you!","217":"Frustrations with Pixel 9+I have severe mixed feelings about my Pixel 9 that I have for a while now, and I love the feel of the UI and the camera, but everything else is just becoming increasingly frustrating. Firstly, is there a bug with notifications? For some reason my notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram and Messenger are either delayed or they don't ring at all. I'd looked up various solutions online and shut down the adaptive battery functions, double checked the apps notification but they still fail to notify me. I have another spare phone from Poco that gets my notifications almost immediately, and the performance of the Pixel is just embarrassing. What is going on with that? Are there any other solutions about it? Secondly, when I'm using WIFI to make video calls or play online games, there always seems to be an issue about connectivity and I'll lag seriously here and there, and my solution is just to switch off WIFI and just proceed with that. It usually solves the problem, but again why is it that other devices wouldn't have this problem? Let's not even go there about the Tensor chip because the performance is quite disappointing in gaming but thankfully I'm only a casual one and don't play demanding games.Thirdly, with the Reddit app, there seems to be a bug where when I'm scrolled all the way to the top on a subreddit, I'm unable to click on the toolbar that's in the frame with the subreddit header above to search and I have to go back to the main page and search from there. Does anyone else have this issue?Dang it. The photos of that the Pixel 9 take are awesome, and for the most part it's sufficient for my daily use, but these little things annoy me. There are so many reviewers that rate the Pixel 9 Pro as the best phone of 2024, and I'm wondering if the gap between the two phones are that huge? I don't need the bells and whistles, not the extra lens. But there shouldn't be such a big gap performance-wise right? Seriously considering the Chinese foldable phones on the market...","218":"Pixel 8 is absolutely garbage - VENT+Hi all,Long time android user here. I have been through several Android smartphones, from Samsung Galaxy S2 to OnePlus7. I have been through them all. Although I wasn't very happy with all Android smartphones, I personally feel my OnePlus7 purchase was the best.The reason why I love Android because I hate ads and on Android I can root my smartphone and block ads at a DNS level. That's the only reason I never moved to an iPhone.I love stock Android and prefer to install lineage but as with all third party ROMs, some functionality or the other gets broken. Hence, this time I decided to buy a Pixel as it would come with a stock ROM and the only thing I would need to do is root my smartphone and install an ad blocking apk thereby creating the perfect device.I bought the Pixel 8 on September 2023 and I truly regret my purchase. It is an absolute piece of garbage and the entire Pixel team in Google should honestly be sorry for creating such a piece of garbage. The below are my issues with Pixel 8.1. Heating - This phone heats like crazy when I use it on 5G. One of the reasons I upgraded to Pixel 8 from OnePlus 7 was because OnePlus 7 did not support 5G. However, after seeing the heating issue on 5G, I was forced to keep my device on LTE which negated the whole purpose of buying this device. I suspect some of this heating has to do with Google's tensor chip which is very subpar compared to Apple's in house SoC and even Qualcomm's SoC. I don't know they developed tensor? Just because Apple has their own SoC, I guess?2. Lag and bugs - Several popular apps such as Swiggy (food delivery app in India) and other apps lag like crazy on this device. This issue has been confirmed by others as well. There is a random bug on instagram which causes brightness to increase to max for certain reels which is very weird to say the least.3. Build and screen size - Screen size is smaller and build is heftier than usual. I hate holding this device. At a time when other manufacturers have moved towards less bezel and more display, Google has gone the opposite way.4. App switcher button not working - This is the craziest bug of them all. The app switch button simply doesn't work. I have realized that this has been a recurrent issue with Pixel phones and something Google simply refuses to address? I mean what kind of snobby head in their a\\*\\*\\* kind of engineers does Google have that they simply do not address such a simple bug for years together? Even low quality Chinese OEMs do a better job at fixing simple bugs like these on their device and here we have the \"flagship\" Google phone for which there is no fix. I pay iPhone equivalent price for such a piece of shit.5. Useless AI gimmicks - Instead of nailing down the basics of what makes a good phone, Google has decided to stuff it with useless AI gimmicks which 99% of people are never going to use. I have personally not used a single one of them.WORST OF IT ALL COMES BELOW.5. After sales service - There is literally negligible after sales service for Pixel, at least in India. I started seeing a pink line on my display and gave it to the service center which is authorized by Google. Anyone wants to guess the TAT? 15 DAYS !!! Yes, not 15 hours, 15 DAYS. There is no replacement device provided and the service center is a third party center which doesn't even pick my calls on most days and all Google reviews for Pixel for this service center is 1 star. For my OnePlus7, the battery had worn off and they replaced the same within 2 hours. Just 2 hours. That's it.Conclusion - I made a blunder spending $700 on Pixel 8 over here in India. It is half my monthly salary. I don't even know if I will ever get my phone back from the service center, even if I do, I don't want to use it for more than a year before I switch to iPhone for good. I will watch some ads but at least I will have a much better phone to use.  Edit - The downvotes are crazy, it is because of die hard fanboys like you that Google and its Pixel team gets away with such a shitty phone. If this were a third party OEM who built such a phone at such a price, they would be bankrupt by now. Anyhow, keep funding the snobs at Google. I personally, am done.","219":"2 swipes to change brightness is driving me nuts...+Anyways around this?  The quick settings in general are so horrible to use in imo coming from an iphone 13 and a lenovo tablet.  On both my android lenovo and my iphone it worked the same, drag down from top right corner for quick settings, drag from top left for notifications.  Simple, fast, easy.On the pixel though there is no top right or top left drawer... just the top, and not only do you have to drag down twice to change brightness, the crazy thing is you have to swipe UP TWICE to put it away too.  Such terrible design... I don't need to see my notifications on the way up and on the way down every time I want to change my brightness  (which is a lot).I found a free app called \"bottom quick settings\" which kinda addresses the issue but it's very buggy.  I didn't realize android came in so many different flavors, when I use my moms samsung or my housemates xiaomi it's also the same thing, drag down once to change your brightness.TL;DR, the pixel UI quick settings is terrible please help me fix it.  I will flash a custom os or even trade my 8a in for a different phone if that's the only solution it bugs me that much.  Edit: I should clarify, I know about the two finger method and I think it's terrible, since it's impossible to do with one hand.  Google should really just make an option that lets you choose between 2 fingers, or having separate corners for notifications or quick settings just like iphone and other android UIs have.","220":"Google refuses to refund me after declining my return.+Hello everyone, I would like to ask for help in this situation. I am very angry with the way Google has treated me and I would like to ask for an option or opinion.On 12 September I placed an order worth \u20ac1,429 on the Google Store. It was a 512GB Pixel 9 Pro XL.I received it, and days later, I returned it because it was a gift for my sister, and in the end she opted for the new iPhone. A few days later it arrived at the Google Store in Poland, via UPS.On 25 September UPS tried to deliver the order. My surprise was that \"the recipient has refused the order\". I was very surprised. I immediately contacted Google to ask for an explanation. Neither by email nor by chat I got a reply. \"We are investigating what happened\". They are just saying me this everyday. Days have passed and the order was returned to the sender (me) by UPS, which is uncertain; the order has been in \"Processing at UPS centre\" since 29 September. Nothing was back with me.I find myself in the situation that I don't have the order, I don't have the refund and I don't have anything. I have lost my mobile and my money. Google refuses to cooperate or reimburse until they receive the order that I do not longer own.Just today was the last time I called them, and they told me to contact the shipping agency to identify the order, which I refuse because it is their responsibility. Don't they have insurance or liability for lost packages?An hour ago I put a claim to the bank with all the proofs and all this (but more extended). Any similar experience? I am very indignant. I didnt expect to receive this passivity and lack of collaboration from such a large company.From what I've read on other Reddit posts, it seems I'm not the only one with this problem.It's clear that this will be the first and last time I buy a Pixel, and of course, an order here.Thank you very much for reading me.Update: 14th October, 2024 -> Chargeback has been accepted. Money got back. Google rejected helping.","221":"I'm disappointed - Pixel 9+Hello everyone. I've been using a P9 for about a month. I'm coming from a 4 years old Oneplus 8. Overall, the phone is ok, it takes great photos, but other than that and the great build quality\/design it didn't feel like much of an upgrade. I just needed a new phone because the Oneplus battery got quite fried.My issues with the phone:1. Android auto calls have no sound & microphone doesn't work. Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum.2. Apps are always killed in the background, any app. Can't keep anything running in the background (very annoying while gaming - I'm playing PUBG). I tried enabling background usage for specific apps, it didn't make a difference. This wasn't an issue on the OP83. Buttons placement4. Bottom speaker placement - it should have been on the other side of the charging port in my opinion in order to not get muffled while watching content in landscape mode.5. Charging speed is slow even compared to my 2020 Oneplus 86. It gets hot quite easily7. Battery life is not consistent, varies from one day to another8. No way to turn off the screen other than the power button (double tap on home screen for example)9. Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10. Google photos is annoying and bad - its sole purpose is to make you purchase google drive storage11. Screen borders (bezel) too thick - compared to my 2020 OP812. Call sounds routing to headphones.When the call is ended the sound is routed to phone speakers for 2 seconds, you only hear the call ending tone in the phone speakers, not in the headphones. This is not such a big deal, but it just shows how much attention Google put into the basics of this phone - not too much.Considering all of these I'm thinking about returning the phone (I have 60 day return policy). My question here is: how many of these issues, mainly the software related ones (1, 2, 12), are also present on the P9 Pro? I like the phone overall and I would be willing to make a compromise and get the 9 Pro for the great camera and the long term support if some of these issues are not present. Otherwise I will just wait for the Oneplus 13 to be available in Europe. Thanks!","222":"Pixel 8 ongoing modem Issues, Google refuses to acknowledge+I am one who truly hates these \"I'm out of here\" and \"going back to iPhone\" posts, but I also don't see any posts that actually address the modem issues with the Pixel 8. Similar, reaching out to Google is like pulling hair. I've managed to get one \"supervisor\" to admit the issue was present and that they're \"working hard to fix it\", but Google's go-to is always warranty swap.We have 3 Pixel 8s in the house, and it was sometime earlier this year that we identified many calls were not coming through to our handsets. Our son would send us a message on Facebook saying \"tried to call, just silence then voicemail\". We'd go to call him back and our phones would just hang. We would have to toggle airplane mode on and off, then be able to make\/receive calls.To be fair, we do live on the fringe of cell service, but this was never (and still isn't) an issue with the kids in our house with iPhones.I set up some testing using an automated platform, dispatching an automated call at the top of every hour to the 3 Pixel 8s in our house. About 1\/3 of the tests failed, with the calls either hanging (silence) or directly to voicemail - in some cases, it was 10-20 seconds of silence, then voicemail. In some cases, the incoming call would not ring, but be marked as a missed call, then the actual call would come in behind it seconds later.When the calls did reach the handset, incoming calls made the phone go from 5G to LTE then 3G, and back to 5G. We forced the phones into LTE, then tried this test again, but still, they downgraded to 3G.I also did similar with SMS, but they were all delivered either instantly or within 30 seconds.I'm not going to fully rule out the network here, but the iPhones in the house can handle the exact same cell network with no issues. I suspect we are a small percentage, but still a percentage.The real kicker was following the two April updates, the Pixels were suddenly dropping the WiFi connection, too. I'd get an email and notice my phone didn't go off, only to see the WiFi icon was gone, cellular was dormant, and my saved home WiFi network was disabled due to bad connectivity. Again, airplane toggle on and off fixed both. iPhones maintained their connection. For these reasons, we can't use WiFi calling, either.So, these modems clearly can't handle fringe\/edge cellular connections. Google has admitted this is a problem. A quick search on Reddit, which Google support refuses to acknowledge, shows I am not alone.What now, Google? Do we just wait? Do I keep this Pixel support going until it really burns me, like a 911 call that doesn't go through, or a call from the school that our son is violently ill and needs to come home?Where do we draw the line? I'm not your beta tester. Our lives aren't your test group.I'd love an actual response from Google, but I won't hold my breath.Carrier is Rogers\/Located in Ontario, Canada","223":"Do you feel like the stock Google apps are getting worse?+I've noticed that for the past year or so, it feels like the stock Google apps have just been getting worse. Sometimes, with the clock app, I have to kill the app just to stop alarms. The Google wallet app feels like its been getting slower. Now I have to wait for the card previews to load just to switch which card I'm paying with. The Youtube app will sometimes just break. Content will keep playing in the background and you can't open the app at all, forcing you to kill it. Sometimes I can't return to a call in the phone app, and I have to ask the person on the other end to hang up the phone since I can't get back to the call screen.I have a Pixel 7 Pro. I could sorta understand if these issues were happening on an older model. But this model is still pretty much brand new. Has anyone else noticed this?","224":"Google has created a privacy nightmare with Google Password Manager that will store all of your passwords in the cloud, you cannot opt to \"only have your passwords stored locally on device\", Google will only let you store your passwords in the cloud. Man I hate Google so much!!!+So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go \"Is that child porn?\" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here \"A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious.\"\u00a0[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said \"Why should other people have more privacy than I do?\" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer \"only store passwords locally on device\" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While\u00a0not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable \"Advanced Data Protection\" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself;\u00a0this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account.\u00a0So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default.

I have a starred contact named Work, lets say the number is +1 (234)567-8900.This morning, after my phone was on the normal Sleep do not disturb schedule, I wake up and see a notification that says \"Missed Call - Work\", from 4:26am. It had never rang. I even confirmed with my surveillance camera recording, no sounds were playing at that time, but the phone screen was showing \"Incoming call from +1 (234)567-8900\".  My notification history also says \"Incoming call from +1 (234)567-8900\" at 4:26am. But there was no \"Incoming call from Work\" popup, just the raw number, which is why I think it didn't get through DND as a starred contact.However, the \"Missed Call - Work\" notification that was remaining when I woke up was NOT worded as \"Missed Call - On Do Not Disturb\" which shows up when a random number calls me and the phone correctly stays silent. So it seems like the missed call notification correctly identified the contact, but not while it was actively ringing.I have successfully had this contact call me through Do Not Disturb in the past with no problem, several times per month. So it can't be a problem on my end. What would cause it to randomly fail just this once? And how do I fix it to never happen again?It's very, VERY bad to miss this call. So much so that I've had to order an iPhone and will be throwing my android away if it's not resolved by the time the iPhone gets here.[Here is a screenshot](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3sID25f.png) of my notification history where you see the \"Incoming call\" as just a number, but the \"Missed call\" shows the correct contact. Makes no sense right?I have Work saved with two numbers, +1 234-567-8900 (exactly matching the format shown in the screenshot) and also just (234)567-8900.Any ideas? Really don't to become an Apple user.","226":"Google Sent My Mother a Phone That Was Apparently Stolen+Recently my mother bought a new Pixel 8 from the Google Store and used Synchrony to finance the phone. We are US based. After she bought the phone she went to a wedding in Canada. This is when things started to go south.Once in Canada she no longer had T-Mobile service despite other family members with iPhones on the same plan having service. When she returned to the US she still had no service. Her sim card seemed fine and worked on other phones. We eventually contact T-Mobile and they tell us that they blocked the phone from service because the phone has been marked as stolen. T-Mobile told us that Google marked the phone as stolen.We contact Google support and they know nothing about the phone being marked as stolen. They tell us to contact T-Mobile again. We tell T-Mobile that Google knows nothing and it becomes a finger pointing game. Eventually my mother gets service again but that only lasted for a few days.My mother tried going to another phone company, Visible, and they said they couldn't service the phone because it was marked as stolen. Google throughout this time has not been helpful at all. My mother has had to use her sister's phone to make phone calls and she's talked to a million people who do not really know how to help.Since the phone was not working for whatever reason, my mother attempted to return it and get a replacement phone. The issue was that she did not want to pay the price of a new phone for a refurbished phone. This is a phone that she had for about less than a month I believe.Google Support refused to send a new phone and sent a refurbished phone instead. After a lot of back and forth with support they also refused to give any kind of discount or refund any money.My mother decided reject the shipment of the refurbished phone from Fedex and has attempted to pursue the route of trying to get a full refund. Synchrony won't refund anything until Google has approved the refund and she received an email today saying they would not issue the refund. She emailed back and now they are talking about \"escalating.\"My mother is at a point where she is wanting to pursue legal assistance. What can we do? She now has no phone and a bill to pay. I'm going to submit a Reddit Request form once I get the necessary information from her.This has all been an awful experience for us taking days and I regret telling her to buy her phone from the Google Store.  UPDATE: 10\/25My mother received an email from Google support saying they were going to issue a refund. I guess this matter is resolved. I don't think it should have taken so much time and effort.","227":"Disabling all tapping sounds+I got a Pixel 8A the other day as an upgrade from my old iPhone 8. Generally I am satisfied as it of course is a huge upgrade from such an old phone. I knew that I would get frustrated due to the swap from iOS to Android but I am getting more frustrated than I thought.I do not want ANY sound to come from my phone from touch input. No sound from the keyboard, opening\/closing apps, tapping, etc. I am used to iPhones silent feature where you slide the button on the side and everything is set to silent and any calls come through with vibration. It seems to me that Pixel does not have this function (let me know if I am wrong).I of course immediately disabled \"tap and click sounds\" in the settings and I thought that would be it. But some apps still make a sound when I tap passwords for example. I am at my fucking wits end with this. This phone's hardware may be an upgrade but I am getting really annoyed with the software. I also don't mind haptics but I fucking hate sounds. My phone needs to be completely silent at all times except when I purposefully play a song or something. I like vibrations but right now it seems if I want vibrations then I am getting sound. My notifications don't make a sound but they also don't make any vibrations (I would like for some apps).Im sorry if this isnt a very good post and that my questions arent that clear but I want to like this phone.

Please check and confirm my experience with this error. I suspect this is a larger issue, as it occurs with the P7 and two P8Ps. The error is a completely flickering display (the entire screen), which occurs when a video is shown under certain conditions.

Trade in received on Nov 21 and received inspection email on Nov 24 but never received refund confirmation.The trade in status page is stuck on Old device received -->Device assessed-->Refund not credited.  Contacted google 10+ times since November,(chat, call etc), everytime they need to \"escalate this to higher support team\" and get back to me with in 24-72 hours, they never do, they even confirmed the post inspection value to be 699 but never proceed to issue the refund.   BBB, state AG complaint filed (CA and my state), received generic reply from google \"please contact our support for your concern.....\"  Moral of the story? I know probably about 95 out of 100 trade-ins goes without problem(and there will be people in the comments saying \"My TrAdE In HaD No PrObLeM.....\"), but when things goes south and you are that unlucky percentage of people who experiences issues with trade in, google WILL NOT take care of you and make things right as a customer. I had been with google devices since the nexus era (Galaxy nexus-->nexus 5-->pixel 1,2,5,7,8,9) and this will be my last google device sadly. The customer service structure(actual support that can do things never speaks to a customer directly) makes a regular customer almost impossible to get the direct help they needed.  ","230":"Echo on phone calls - Pixel 9 Pro+Hello, I use Pixel 9 Pro and people I talk to on the phone complain that there are random moments that they can hear themselves (echo). It doesn't matter if I use messenger\/whatsapp or normal phone call, the problem is still there. It happens so randomly, one day I can have a 30 min conversation without that issue once, and the other day it happens every 3 minutes and lasts for a few seconds. I noticed that it is more likely to happen if I don't speak for a longer time and the other person speaks.I tried to disable WiFi calling, Bluetooth and wifi and mobile data while on the phone but the problem still happens. It's really a bummer because Pixel is a phone first and foremost, I'd expect to have normal phone call experience on such device.Anyone had similar issue?","231":"Is Google EVER Going to Fix the Bug With Cellular Signal?+I have been dealing with Google's complete denial that there's an issue with the Pixel phones holding cellular signal since at least as far back as the Pixel 3 series phones. I had a P6P that I ended up returning to Google at nine months old for a full refund because I could prove to them that I was missing calls due to the phone effectively losing connectivity to the cellular network.I went to the dark side (Sammy) and struggled to get that phone to work decently. Afer far too much wrangling of configuration and swapping out the junk Samsung apps for Google ones (phone, Messages, etc.), I had a -phone- that was solid but a camera that was super bland. The OneUI update was months late coming to my handset and I opted to swap back to the Google Pixel by grabbing a P7P.Fast forward about 18 months and things have been mostly 'ok' with the incoming call issue blowing up a few months back when they borked an update. THAT took way too long to get corrected, but it did settle back down. Now, here we are again where random incoming calls simply never hit my phone and the caller just ends up in voicemail.Google seemingly continues to deny that this is an issue yet I can still prove that I am missing calls at times when I shouldn't. All I want is to be able to rely on my phone to be... well... a PHONE!","232":"Buyers be warned+I wanted to share my first, and probably last experience of using the Google store for anyone thinking of using it, as I'd decided to take the plunge and order a P9P and have had nothing but issues with the order since.I saw posts about the 30% off the Pixel 9 Pro and XL, so checked and could see that I was eligible. I haven't had a Pixel since the 5, reviews for the 9 sounded very positive, so was tempted. I hopped over to the store, picked out a 9 Pro and added a trade in for my current phone, which brought the overall cost down a lot, making it a bit of a no-brainer. Add everything to the basket, apply the discount and order. Great! Immediately after the order, I get a confimation email of the order, and two two separate emails from PayPal for two different payments taken of the same amount from Google. So I jump on to Google support, they can see a second order, hidden to me as I could only see the one, had been placed, so they cancelled it. Sorted.Except an hour later, I get an email to say my trade-in had been cancelled. I check my order, and the trade-in had been cancelled for my remaining order without any input from me. I get back on to Google's support, and spend 1.5 hours chatting to them while they see what they can do. And apparently the can't do anything. It can't be added back onto the order, and the only way to get it again would be to place another order. But I've used my 30% code and so can't use it again with the trade-in, although support found it really hard to understand that I wanted to keept the 30% off dicount AND get the trade-in.Since then there's been a lot of \"wait and see if the discount refreshes\" and \"give it 24 hours and then let's see what we can do\". I wait, I let them know the discount hasn't refreshed, and their response was that I couldn't be issued another discount as I had already used one, and to \"be assured that the device you ordered with the 30% discount is on its way to your address.\" Which I know already, and they continue to display a clear lack of understanding of what the issue is. I've not cancelled the trade-in. I assume it's happened as some part of a clerical error on their side when cancelling the other duplicate order that I hadn't placed. But there's no way at all for them to reinstate the trade-in to the current order.It's been incredibly frustrating and I will be returning the phone, as it only made sense to me to buy with both the discount and the trade-in, and I'm astonished at the glitches and lack of help I've received with what seemed like a simple process. It's definitely put me off using the Google store again and probably from the Pixel line as a whole, as I'd dred to think what would happen if I ever had an issue with a device.Ok, rant over. I just wanted to share my experience of attempting to move back to the Pixel, and how I'll be holding out for another phone in the future.","233":"PSA - images showing as \"Can't load file\" when transferring messages from your old device+**TL;DR: After you transfer your messages from your old device, they often appear as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d in Google Messages.\u00a0 This eventually resolves itself, albeit still with some bugs.\u00a0 Also, Google One may prompt you to transfer MMS again.\u00a0 In my experience, doing this will create a duplicate of every image\/video and causes Google Messages to get much slower.**-----------Here are the issues I\u2019ve discovered through the process of transferring my messages (SMS, MMS, RCS) from my Pixel 8 Pro to my Pixel 9 Pro XL.\u00a0\u00a0**Read this if you transferred your messages from an old device but the images in your chat threads are showing up as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.**During initial setup, you can transfer the following from your old device to your new device.\u00a0 Transferring from your old device (in lieu of restoring from a Google One backup) is supposedly the only way to transfer RCS as-is (instead of them being converted to MMS).\u00a0\u00a0* Apps* Contacts* SMS messages* MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now reports that it contains over 70,000 messages. (Although if I view the backup in the app, it lists only around 50,000 messages, so maybe something is kinda broken.)(2)  You cannot see images and videos when you view the conversation details from within a specific chat thread.(3)  If you open an image from the search bar in Google Messages and tap \u201cSee in chat\u201d, it\u2019ll bring you to a random chat thread (mine brings me to a 2FA text thread from Lowe\u2019s, for every picture I\u2019ve tried).\u00a0 When I go to \\[...\\] > Details in that thread, all the images show up; however, they don\u2019t actually appear in the thread, only in that Details screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the 5-digit phone number for these 2FA codes may be the first to appear numerically in the database?(4)  [This article](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/08\/23\/pixel-9-google-messages-rcs-transfer\/) suggests updating your old device to the beta version of Google Messages before doing the transfer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do that and think it\u2019s ridiculous that it should be necessary.**CONCLUSION:**It appears that Google Messages is now integral to the transfer process, presumably because they\u2019re trying to transfer RCS messages as-is.\u00a0 After the transfer, you\u2019ll see that your Google Messages app storage consumes multiple GB while your Phone and Messaging Storage app database consumes almost nothing.\u00a0 Normally, the latter is at least a few GB because that\u2019s where MMS \/ text media are stored.\u00a0 Over time, things seem to migrate from the Google Messages app storage into the Phone and Messaging Storage app, but there are still bugs, as described above.","234":"Google Pixel 8 PRO - all I want is the image I see on my viewfinder!+Hello friends!Maybe I'm old fashioned photographer, but I want to capture what I see on my viewfinder.

I bought this phone when it first came out (October 2023), so it\u2019s been about a year. The moment I updated to Android 15, my Bluetooth completely stopped working. I\u2019m talking completely unresponsive, no way to turn it on, nothing.I reached out to Google Support, and they had me go through all the basic troubleshooting steps. Resetting Bluetooth and network settings? Done. Restarting the phone? Tried it. Safe mode? Tried it. Nothing worked. The Bluetooth just stayed dead, and I\u2019m left thinking, \u201cWhat now?\u201dThen, they suggested a factory reset. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about this, but they basically said they couldn\u2019t help me unless I did it. So, I went ahead and reset the entire phone\u2014still no luck. Called support again, and at this point, they had no new solutions for me. I\u2019m stuck.To make matters worse, my warranty had expired, and they told me that getting this \u201cupdate issue\u201d fixed would cost around $500 at an official Google shop\u2014half the price of the phone! When I pushed back, saying this was clearly a software issue from their update, they offered me a 20% discount on a new phone. Really?Desperate for a fix, I even opted into the Android beta program, hoping maybe it would resolve the issue. Instead, it made things worse. My phone now restarts five or six times daily, and the Bluetooth is still dead. And if I want to downgrade back to Android 15, I\u2019d have to wipe all my data completely. I\u2019m basically stuck with a glitchy, rebooting phone and no Bluetooth\u2014and Google has no real solution for me.So now, here I am, with a month of no Bluetooth on my Pixel 8 Pro, random reboots, no help from Google, and a really bad taste in my mouth. I\u2019ve been a Google user for years, but this experience with their Pixel lineup might just push me over to Apple.Any others out there facing similar issues?

The name is a misspelling of my own.I've chased up with DPD who said they will investigate the driver but can't help with the parcel.

Are there solutions other than returning or getting used to it? Would they even let me return if there is technically nothing wrong with it?","250":"The P9P XL's vapor chamber cooling is actually pretty good.+**That** ***Wired*** **Article**Earlier, I saw a [Wired article](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/review\/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl\/) posted here where the author mentioned that he played nearly 2 hours of Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) with maxed settings and didn't see it stuttering that much.I thought that there was no way this was true, so as an avid player of the game (yes, that's where the ZZZ in my name comes from), I tried it out on my new P9P XL. There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions. Happy to answer them.","251":"Pixel 9 Pro: Image Quality Issues?+My new Pixel 9 Pro arrived yesterday - I'd finally had enough of my Samsung Galaxy S9+'s potato-quality camera, so I couldn't wait to unbox the Pixel 9 Pro, hoping for a photographic powerhouse. While it initially seemed promising, I've encountered some significant issues, particularly with image quality.The most glaring problem is the 50MP mode. There's a noticeable half-second lag when taking photos, which makes it almost impossible to capture moving subjects. I tried to capture a sweet moment of my son kissing my wife on the cheek, but the half-second delay meant the photo captured him already pulling away. It's incredibly frustrating, so I've switched back to 12MP.Even at 12MP, image quality in indoor lighting is surprisingly poor. I've noticed excessive noise in low-light conditions, and the camera seems to struggle with dynamic range. Some photos often have overly bright shadows, giving an artificial look. Turning off HDR helps somewhat. The Pixel's processing reminds me of my early days with Lightroom, where I'd often crank up the shadows and crush the highlights \u2013 a style I've since moved on from. Unfortunately, the Pixel seems stuck in that era, giving many photos an overly processed look. In other photos the aggressive post-processing softens details and makes images appear over-smoothed. My wife even commented that it looks like I'm using a beauty filter!Comparing the Pixel to my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max under the same conditions highlights the Pixel's shortcomings even further. The iPhone consistently captures more detail, better dynamic range, althought the colours on the Pixel are nicer, imo.The shifting between lenses, going from 1x to 5x zoom is particularly noticeable and slightly jarring but not a major issue. A minor note, but despite both capturing 12MP images, the Pixel 9 Pro's photos are surprisingly smaller (around 2.1MB) compared to my old Samsung S9+'s 4.5MB files, which might explain the perceived lack of detail.While the Pixel 9 Pro's camera isn't a complete disaster, it falls short of my expectations, especially given the hype surrounding it. I'm hoping that Google can address these issues with software updates. Until then, I'm finding it hard to justify the upgrade from my old S9+.Am I missing something?","252":"Pixel 9 Pro XL Charging measurements+There's a lot of info floating around about how to optimally charge the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I happen to have a USB tester, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and an assortment of chargers, including the official Google charger, the Ugreen Nexode 65W, and a bunch of other randos.First, please realize that the max reported charge is only available when the phone has very low battery, and it is reasonably cool. As the phone heats up, and as the battery increases in charge, the charging is intentionally slowed down. Officially, Google claims up to 70% charge in 30 minutes, with the following glorious fine print:>Fast wired charging rates (up to 27W on Pixel 9, up to 27W on Pixel 9 Pro, and up to 37W on Pixel 9 Pro XL) are based upon use of the Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. Adapters sold separately. Charging speed based upon testing with device batteries drained to 1% and charged with Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger. Charging testing conducted by Google in early 2024 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings with the device powered on. Charging speed depends upon many factors including usage during charging, battery age, and ambient temperature. Actual charging speed may be slower.With that in mind, here's what I've found.# Official Google ChargerPhone is at 38%, the charger pushed 17.5V, 1.96A -> 34.3W. Close to the published max of 37W, it's probably held back because I'm at 38%. When I get a chance, I'll drain the battery completely and see what we get. [https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd](https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd)# UGreen Nexode 65WThis charger supports all the appropriate specs... It  has Power Delivery (aka PD), Programmable Power Supply (aka PPS) up to 21V. This *should* have been just as good as the official charger. Unfortunately, it was not to be... Like above, with the phone at 38%, we get 8.92V, 2.91A -> 26.0W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB)The charging cable I used above was a run-of-the-mill cable, only rated to 3A. I figured it's worth trying with a 5A rated cable. Unfortunately, we got the same results: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK)# Random Amazon Basics 65W chargerThis charger does not support PPS, so I was expecting something similar to the UGreen. It did settle in at the 9V range, but interestingly the current was kept near 2A, despite being capable of pushing 3A @ 9V. Actual output: 9.15V, 2.13A -> 19.5W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D)Just in case, I used the higher amp cable, but it wasn't needed - the negotiated current was kept under 3A.# Previous Google Phone ChargerI think it was from my 6a. On the adapter it said max 9V, 2A, and indeed that's what it pushed. Specifically 9.17V, 1.94A -> 17.8W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7)# ConclusionsGiven my chargers, only the official Google one could max out the phone. I'm really not sure why the UGreen didn't - and frankly a bit disappointed in the purchase. Still, it was about 50% better than the non-PPS enabled chargers. Speaking of non-PPS enabled chargers, it looks like they top out at \\~9V and \\~2A, which is about half the charging ability of the native Google charger.I have read that there's an Anker charger that can manage full speeds. I have also read that a full-speed charger needs to support PPS up to 21V, and that 20V chargers wouldn't get there. But that seems odd to me considering the max charge I saw with the Google charger occurred at under 18V.That's all I got for now. If I get any more chargers, I'll add them here.","253":"I'm disappointed - Pixel 9+Hello everyone. I've been using a P9 for about a month. I'm coming from a 4 years old Oneplus 8. Overall, the phone is ok, it takes great photos, but other than that and the great build quality\/design it didn't feel like much of an upgrade. I just needed a new phone because the Oneplus battery got quite fried.My issues with the phone:1. Android auto calls have no sound & microphone doesn't work. Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum.2. Apps are always killed in the background, any app. Can't keep anything running in the background (very annoying while gaming - I'm playing PUBG). I tried enabling background usage for specific apps, it didn't make a difference. This wasn't an issue on the OP83. Buttons placement4. Bottom speaker placement - it should have been on the other side of the charging port in my opinion in order to not get muffled while watching content in landscape mode.5. Charging speed is slow even compared to my 2020 Oneplus 86. It gets hot quite easily7. Battery life is not consistent, varies from one day to another8. No way to turn off the screen other than the power button (double tap on home screen for example)9. Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10. Google photos is annoying and bad - its sole purpose is to make you purchase google drive storage11. Screen borders (bezel) too thick - compared to my 2020 OP812. Call sounds routing to headphones.When the call is ended the sound is routed to phone speakers for 2 seconds, you only hear the call ending tone in the phone speakers, not in the headphones. This is not such a big deal, but it just shows how much attention Google put into the basics of this phone - not too much.Considering all of these I'm thinking about returning the phone (I have 60 day return policy). My question here is: how many of these issues, mainly the software related ones (1, 2, 12), are also present on the P9 Pro? I like the phone overall and I would be willing to make a compromise and get the 9 Pro for the great camera and the long term support if some of these issues are not present. Otherwise I will just wait for the Oneplus 13 to be available in Europe.

After you transfer your messages from your old device, they often appear as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d in Google Messages.\u00a0 This eventually resolves itself, albeit still with some bugs.\u00a0 Also, Google One may prompt you to transfer MMS again.\u00a0 In my experience, doing this will create a duplicate of every image\/video and causes Google Messages to get much slower.**-----------Here are the issues I\u2019ve discovered through the process of transferring my messages (SMS, MMS, RCS) from my Pixel 8 Pro to my Pixel 9 Pro XL.\u00a0\u00a0**Read this if you transferred your messages from an old device but the images in your chat threads are showing up as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.**During initial setup, you can transfer the following from your old device to your new device.\u00a0 Transferring from your old device (in lieu of restoring from a Google One backup) is supposedly the only way to transfer RCS as-is (instead of them being converted to MMS).\u00a0\u00a0* Apps* Contacts* SMS messages* MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now

No help from Google!+I am posting here as a last resort as I have already tried to get support from Google through various channels - including their live chat, telephone support, Twitter support. They just reiterate the same copy-pasted responses without actually understanding the issue. I have also tried to DM PixelCommunity here on Reddit as well as opened a ticket on dmziggy's Reddit Request form and also DM'ed him directly, receiving no response from all of these channels.I have now turned to post here as I have seen others have had their issues resolved or rectified after posting here and following the subsequent exposure to their issues. Seems Google does not care unless there is an outcry.To summarise what happened, I ordered a the 9 Pro XL directly from Google Store with an estimated delivery date of 22nd August (I have ordered the 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, Buds, Tablet etc all before with no issues). When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it. Therefore, I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold, the phone was not in the actual phone box, and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the space.I immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them. They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there. When I contact DPD, they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and they'll have to rectify\/correct.Google Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and they've ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week. Can somebody please assist or help what I should do from here as a UK customer? I do not want to do a chargeback as I have EVERYTHING on my Google account so do not want to risk losing it all.TLDR: Phone stolen\/lost from inside delivery box (images taken and sent to Google). Zero assistance or support from Google store on all their support channels over the past 3 weeks. Need advice on what do as a UK customer, feeling extremely helpless.","262":"No audio through Android Auto (Pixel 9 Pro XL)+Edit:  SOLVED!  u\/Squintz82 posted [this](https:\/\/support.google.com\/androidauto\/thread\/312020339\/no-audio-via-android-auto-after-december-2024-feature-drop?hl=en) which lead me in the right direction of what to enable.

That being said, I have a Windows PC and I'm using many Google apps.Long story short: I switched back to iPhone.The 16 Plus is working very well, great performance and photos, and the battery life is really great BUT... now I find the user interface and the overall experience so boring. In addition, I hate not having a general gesture for going back and I'm missing GBoard a lot.Frankly I'm surprised... I was not thinking I would have missed Android, since while I was there I was often complaining about the lack of optimization for third-party apps, some bugs, and the fact that sometimes I had to tinker with APKs, configurations and all that jazz, instead of having something that _just worked_ well as with iOS (I had a Xiaomi Note 10 Lite, so maybe some issues were related to the MIUI).For the above reasons I'm considering buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL, since I've read rave reviews and I'd also like to have a vanilla Android experience.**Is there anybody that made the switch from iPhone 15\/16 to this model?** I'd be interested to know more about:* Battery life* Reception and call quality (5G)* GPS (I've seen some posts about people complaining about poor signal)* Photo quality: I'm keen on taking landscape photos in particular; I like the results of the \"Pixel treatment\" that I've seen and I'm wondering also how it scores in low-light\/night contexts* Performance: did you notice any lag or stutter during daily activities? Any bugs?* Overheating issues?* Every Gemini\/AI feature is available also outside US?N.B.

I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning.

The name is a misspelling of my own.I've chased up with DPD who said they will investigate the driver but can't help with the parcel. They advised me to raise a 'parcel search investigation' with Google, but advisors on both the phone and live chat state that since it's been delivered \"our job is done\" - no joke, I\u2019m just being told tough luck, thanks for the money.I actually used klarna through the Google store, which strangely doesn\u2019t seem to have debited me yet, but even their services seem to suggest \u201cask Google\u201d. Feeling very down about this whole situation and tempted to never buy from Google again after how they\u2019ve handled this. Can anyone please help advise what to do next as a UK customer?\u2014\u2014UPDATE: For those interested or in a similar situation, I\u2019m now three days in and the Google agents I\u2019ve spoken to have all refused to help - even the manager that had the issue escalated. I\u2019ve got screenshots of them literally saying \u201cwe did our job, if you\u2019re unhappy contact the courier\u201d.A payment has now been taken by Klarna, despite me flagging this problem. I\u2019ve now started a dispute with Klarna directly to try and help challenge the issues I\u2019m having with Google. I\u2019ve never known bad customer service like this before.UPDATE 2: Thank you to PixelCommunity for reaching out and helping me to speedily resolve this in the end. It was a nightmare customer experience but posting here definitely made it a little more bearable. ","305":"Bluetooth connection issues since the December 2024 Android 15 update.+So both my wifes Mazda 3 2012 and my Mazda 6 2011 are having bluetooth connection issues. We both have Google Pixel 8 Pros. Has anyone had any connection issues. It seems that it pairs to the car but doesnt actually connect. Any help out there?  UPDATE UPDATE!! GREAT NEWS! JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on\/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on\/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too. So theres definitely something with the new android jan update that has worked for me. I have also noticed that the BT connection is solid with out any skips or jitters.Give it a go.","306":"Every Pixel Pricing+| Model       | Storage (GB) | US Pricing (USD) | Canada Pricing (CAD) | UK

","307":"Pixel 9 reviews are more like Gemini (AI) reviews+Have you noticed that almost every Pixel review focuses 80% on the phone's AI capabilities and barely tests anything else? I think reviewers might have received instructions from Google about what to cover in their initial reviews. It's hard to believe that every reviewer is so interested in AI that they'd neglect the rest of the phone's features. This seems intentional to boost sales, since the truth is that the phone is 80-90% identical to the Pixel 8 Pro.","308":"I've had THREE Google Pixels completely crap out on me in less than a year. Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ","309":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Official Case is Amazing +For the very few people who care the official Google Pixel 9 pro XL case is amazing. It's very similar to last year's pixel 8 pro case but the silicone is less sticky than last year's which doesn't make it a pain in the ass to put the phone in the pockets of sweatpants.Update: 2 weeks later and the case is still not sticky","310":"Your Google Store order was cancelled+**Auto Cancellations:**  Last week, I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL with Preferred Care and a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, but 24 hours later, my order was automatically canceled. Thinking I had made a mistake, I reordered, but it was canceled again. When I contacted support, they gave me a non-detailed response, citing \"violation of sales terms\" as the reason for the cancellation. When I asked for more details, they repeated the same phrase and hung up.**Cause:**  The next day, I called again, but they hung up on me despite my polite approach. This time, they mentioned it might be an issue with my payment method, although I regularly use the same card for purchases. I tried again with a different card and made some changes to the order details, but the order was canceled once more. Eventually, I reached someone who went through the payment method with me step by step. They suggested various potential issues, like my name being incorrect or missing tax information (which isn't required)! I asked to speak to a manager, and two days later, I received a generic email from someone named \"Sam\" at store-support, once again citing \"violation of sales terms\" without further explanation.**Resolution:**  After doing some research online, I found that **changing the shipping address might solve the issue**. I used my spouse\u2019s work address, and six hours later, the phone was shipped and delivered the next day.","311":"Dust under Pixel 9 camera protector+EDIT: thank you for suggesting Spigen protectors \u2013\u00a0I didn't realise that there would be such a difference, maybe it's obvious but I just assumed that it was going to happen with all protectors. I will find ones from Spigen and hopefully this will improve!  EDIT 2: Also stop telling me about how protectors affect pictures - don't care, didn't ask *****I recently got a new Pixel 9 after they killed 4a's battery, and it's overall great, but the camera size is ridiculous, and the dust issue is even worse.I bought screen protectors, including ones for the camera. Within a few days, SO much dust collected under the protector. I then even replaced it, thinking that maybe it just wasn't sticky enough, but it's been barely a week and it's so gross again.Picture for demonstration: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/CXZVuM0](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/CXZVuM0)The dust gets in through the little microphone (?) hole. I've read many posts about this phone being a dust magnet (which I can get over with the right case), and even about dust being in the actual camera, which thankfully isn't the case. I don't want to go without a case, cause it will definitely get scratched immediately.If the shop (local phone and internet provider) lets me, I am seriously considering returning this and getting a Pixel 8 because of this dumb issue...Has anyone been bothered by this as much as me? Are there solutions other than returning or getting used to it? Would they even let me return if there is technically nothing wrong with it?","312":"The P9P XL's vapor chamber cooling is actually pretty good.+**That** ***Wired*** **Article**Earlier, I saw a [Wired article](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/review\/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl\/) posted here where the author mentioned that he played nearly 2 hours of Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) with maxed settings and didn't see it stuttering that much.I thought that there was no way this was true, so as an avid player of the game (yes, that's where the ZZZ in my name comes from), I tried it out on my new P9P XL. There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions. Happy to answer them.","313":"Another victim of phones being stolen in transit+**11-27-24 Update** \\- Google has finally come to their senses and issued me a refund.  I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8\/28.  On 8\/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.  At this point I'm posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven't thought of or tried to this point.","314":"Google pixel 8 a broken marriage. +I've been a Pixel user since the Pixel 1 came out, and I really enjoyed its camera and picture quality. However, after the Pixel deteriorated quickly, slowing down and having a battery that wouldn't last a day, I moved to the OnePlus 6T. What a device! I love how simple and snappy it was. After that, I upgraded to the OnePlus 9 and then to the Pixel 7 Pro, which was an alright phone, but I wanted a smaller form factor, so I decided to go for the Pixel 8, and it was the biggest mistake I've ever made in buying a phone.Where do I start? The phone is slow, it just won't handle multitasking. If I use maps and I'm playing music and I get a WhatsApp notification, the phone will just freeze, and you can see the frame drop. All apps will feel slow and sluggish. Google, what are you doing? Hardware and software are made in the same laboratory, yet they can't talk to each other the way they should. Totally not worth the price or the time. I guess the Tensor chip is nowhere near what Snapdragon can do, and plus I guess 8GB of RAM is below par. I'm highly disappointed.","315":"Pixel 9 Fingerprint Reader: How\u2019s your experience?+Lots of chatter on the modem, but what about the fingerprint reader? I\u2019m actually slightly disappointed, but I will preface that I use a screen protector and have always used one.In that sense here\u2019s my comparison:* Pixel 6 Pro: Initially really bad maybe 75% success rate only, but after software updates got a lot better maybe 3-4 months in and by the time I moved to P7P, it was probably 99% success rate. Despite the overall hate for this fingerprint sensor I actually found it to be decent even in its early days in the sense that it was at least consistent with its 75% success rate. On a Pixel 1 or 3 which I kept around for photo backup purposes, if your fingers were wet coming out of a shower or the kitchen, any leftover moisture would screw it up. If your fingers were wrinkly, you were screwed. The optical sensor of the Pixel was surprisingly generous about this.* Pixel 7 Pro: About as accurate as my P6P in final ~1 year mark but faster. Only slightly.* Pixel 8 Pro: No problems again, just as good as my P7P* Pixel 9 Pro: Maybe when I initially set it up, it felt fast and nice without a screen protector, but over time and since adding a screen protector, it may have regressed. I had expected some life changing unlock, but it\u2019s more or less the same as my P8P, in fact I\u2019d even argue it\u2019s worse. Success rate is like 90-95% on one thumb and I\u2019ve re-setup both fingers with the screen protector and even turned on screen protector mode the same way my 8 Pro suggested I turn it on. There are a lot of times where I have to press down hard with one finger whereas the 8 Pro I can get away with lightly tapping the screen only. The major pro is no blinding light but it wasn\u2019t really an issue for me with the 8 Pro anyway because I\u2019m not that often trying to unlock my phone in complete darkness.So I\u2019m slightly disappointed not only because the performance is just so-so and it\u2019s more or less the same as the 8 Pro but slightly worse but more importantly because the toxicity on this sub. When the rumors uncovered the 9 series would be using an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, anyone who had any doubts or talked about their S24U being just so-so would get downvoted to oblivion. It was like you HAD to believe this fingerprint reader would be the ultimate unlock mechanism that blows everything away. **I\u2019d be curious about everyone else\u2019s experiences and how it compares to your previous phone. I'm specifically curious about those coming from 6\/7\/8 series as that's the direct comparison.**","316":"Pixel 5 appreciation post+Maybe it has been said too many times here already, but I just have to shout out the Pixel 5. I have mine since release, that's just over 4 years now and it still runs great. I will only buy a new one when this one eventually dies. Reason is there is no new phone model which I find appealing.And the main reason is: size, weight, shape and designIt just leighs really nicely in the hand. No sharp, flat sides, small size, low weight.I also like the front camera in the corner, where it distracts the least. And it has a physical finger print sensor which you can find blindly just by feel of the finger. Bezels where also already really good and even, not important but nice to look at.I have a new mid tier Samsung phone at work which is the same size and shape as every modern phone, including the Pixel 9, with its iPhone clone design language. And I hate it. It's not nice to hold in the hand, it's not easily taken out of pockets. It just sucks because it's so bulky.When did we move back in phone evolution? Look at the [two pictures ](https:\/\/www.imgur.com\/a\/31yCXGB), how can the Pixel 5 be the much older Phone?I really hope Google goes back to the Pixel 8 design with the 10 and also brings out a mini version, but I highly doubt it.

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me \/ Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP\/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?","555":"Starlink satellite messaging support is rolling out to the Pixel 9+Looks like T-Mobile and Starlink are starting to let some Pixel 9 users into the satellite messaging beta.Just heard from two Pixel 9 Pro XL users that they were invited to the beta.

Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me \/ Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP\/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?","559":"Google Pixel 8A Impressions: Just Get The 8! - YouTube+","560":"Exclusive: New Google Pixel 8a Renders Leak with 7 years of Security Updates & More+","561":"Google begins shipping locally made Pixel 8 in India ahead of Pixel 9 launch+","562":"Google IO 2024 MEGATHREAD+Day 1: AI AI AI (Android is day 2) AI AI AI - google[Livestream](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XEzRZ35urlk)[ASL Livestream](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6rP2rEWsfpM)Recap[Mishaal's thread ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790427549031604592)[Day 1 of google I\/O in a nutshell](https:\/\/youtube.com\/clip\/Ugkx4ugL0gJnky9Os0Qedztp6ZPniw6Ps3tL?si=qT-U16x2EgiXkeqY)  Hardware:New google glass?Software:[Improved Google photo search](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Google\/status\/1790428759700463632?s=19)[Video\/image fx](https:\/\/aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com\/tools\/video-fx)[Gemini nano on pixel 8](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790441314565386584?t=So1Uu4XPgcrE0-oExEdbpQ&s=19)[Gemini context aware feature](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790441795878633625)[Circle to search homework tool](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790442244241256760)[Gemini in android studio update](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790442556482093491)[Gemini nano on chromebooks\/pc](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790442951535214957)[Google play store tools for devs](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790444808236069066)Day 2: please be Android [No live stream for today \ud83d\ude2d](https:\/\/twitter.com\/puf\/status\/1790762905073512728?t=yE9jaSEXJCqe0FQaBcNZew&s=19)[Android 15 beta 2 release notes](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/about\/versions\/15\/release-notes)[Mishaal's overview of android 15 beta 2](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1790789322465227197)[9to5google android 15 beta 2 overview](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/05\/15\/android-15-beta-2-pixel\/)[10 updates coming to the Android ecosystem](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/android\/android-15-google-io-2024\/#theft-privacy-security)Please let me know if I missing anything, by posting the link in the comments to let me know.

If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data.  * **Offline Device Lock** automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time.  * **Remote Lock** lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil.
