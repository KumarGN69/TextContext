In my case, if I were the Product Owner, I'd like to try to focus on three topics:1. **Complete the freefloating form feature.** I have tested it, and for me, it was something I actually missed from my old Oppo A91. It seems almost ready, but I cannot overlap apps in my phone. Maybe it's a bug, but I would rather this than the Bubbles for all.2. **Improve the video camera.** I went to Sweden to see the Northern Lights and the [results](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DD6kIEPtQEj\/?img_index=1) were better than I expected. However, the videos were terrible. I could barely see anything.3. **Allow double-tap to lock.** Several phones have it including my old Huawei.I have also some nice to have:* Bring back the tiles for Data and WiFi or at least, give us the developers the right to the dirty job. I know it's controversial, but I'd like to have them.* Allow the phone to be scheduled when to turn it on or off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow the Alarm to turn on the phone if it's off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow swiping actions like the three fingers for taking screenshots. My old Oppo has it.Maybe you have other ideas or agree with mine. I prefer to focus on specific features that, if we're lucky, the Android\/Pixel product owner might hear us out about before they dive deeper into development of things that we might not like or agree with their \"research\". Plus, if we just rely on sending feedback through the app, I find it often ends up on deaf ears.Have amazing holidays.","1":"All Pixel 9 Pro upgrades over Pixel 9+Below is the list of all the upgrades you get in the pro phone -1. 1mm extra screen size (insignificant)2.

Currently have a Pixel 6a and recently experienced the following problems:* Wifi continuously disconnects on my home network (two Google Wifi pucks).  This just started in February after a phone update, nothing else changed.  Same internet, same wifi.  So Google broke this obviously and it's impossible to get help.  My family owns iPhones, and two Pixel users (Pixel 7) who aren't experiencing this.  My wifi works great on every wifi network but my home network.* When I make a phone call and need to hit \"1\" for a menu option, it doesn't work.  Call on my wife's iPhone, works fine.  Give me a break...* The Youtube app starts flaking after some amount of time, no pause button and the video is dark.  I have to kill the app to fix it, and then a while later it starts flaking again.With today's tech it seems everything that is working perfectly well is at risk of breaking with the next update.  If Apple gets it right and their product just works when I need it to work, then I'll make the switch.  I've been very happy up until now with Pixel phones, but there's no excuse to continually break simple stuff with each update, they can do better than that.","4":"Husband just got a strange \u2018spoken\u2019 message on his Google Pixel 6?!?+UPDATE: I\u2019m overwhelmed by so many great responses\/empathetic stories - thank you all so much \u2763\ufe0f Please read my ETA\u2019s for answers to questions several have asked\u2026=========================So, a few minutes ago (~10:30pm Central time), my husband was asleep - and his phone, as usual, was in Sleep mode with Do Not Disturb automatically turned on - when he was woken from a sound sleep with his phone speaking some kind of message about Trump (he wasn\u2019t sure - he was just asleep! - if it was a pro or anti-Trump message).  He then checked his phone and there was NO open app or recent notification.Before anyone asks if \u201che was dreaming\u201d, he walked out to the living room to tell me about it and I could hear his phone from the bedroom speaking some OTHER message (we couldn\u2019t hear it from there exactly what the message said).Not sure if it\u2019s connected, but his phone recently updated to Android 15.  So, WTF is this !!??!ETA: also, several people has asked, and, no, he doesn\u2019t use Google Assistant\u2026Please see my last ETA about the Assistant history\u2026ETA:  the big puzzle is what could break through DND?  A quick Google shows no apparent log (that I could find) that the DND keeps if it\u2019s interrupted?ETA:  We also have an Echo Spot in the bedroom, but Activity History on the device doesn\u2019t show any activity at the time this happened\u2026?ETA: I\u2019m adding this part to answer several similar questions\u2026.I\u2019ve said in several replies (and I\u2019m truly sorry that I haven\u2019t more promptly replied to all the 160+ comments which my question prompted, and I thank all of you for each one!) that we both do not Intentionally use Google Assistant.    Since we don\u2019t intentionally use it, I wouldn\u2019t have known until someone suggested to look at Google Assistant history.  So, after researching how to do that, I just now searched his Google Assistant history \u2014- and it does not show ANY activity at all last night - Oct 28 - at around 10:30 pm.   There is an entry that only said \u201cUsed Assistant\u201d on Oct 27 at 6:10pm.  There is also an entry for today - Oct 29 -  saying the same \u201cUsed Assistant\u201d at 12:14pm.  No other details other than that.  However, there is no entry for Oct 28 at all, let alone for 10:30 pm.  Since we don\u2019t intentionally use Google Assistant (by intentional, I mean by saying Hey Google), I was surprised to see ANYthing in the history.  But those are the entries I found, and (even though I don\u2019t know what triggered those entries) I have no idea what \u201cUsed Assistant\u201d without any further details even means, but I don\u2019t believe it indicates that Google Assistant was the culprit.Hopefully this might encourage people to stop downvoting me?  Because I really don\u2019t understand why the downvotes.  But, this is Reddit, so I accept that happens.  ","5":"Any Pixel 7 owners heading into 2025 with their phone?+How do you find it?

Thanks!","6":"Google's 7-Year Update Promise, what do you really think?+Google's commitment to **7 years of updates** is a big deal, but I wonder if it\u2019s sustainable. Will we actually be getting meaningful updates for that long, or just security patches after year 4?Apple has done **5+ years** consistently, but Android brands haven\u2019t had the best track record.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.","8":"Do you think Google will go big with Pixel 10?+Do you think since it will be their 10th iteration of a phone, that they will \"go big\"?

In the process, I somehow hit the power button 5x and set off Emergency SOS.The gentle ringing alarm turns into that blaring siren sound, jolting me about 5ft in the air, scrambling to stop it. I grab my phone and look at the screen (still half asleep). I see the notifications for \"calling 911\" and stuff about sending location and whatever else to emergency contacts. I'm thinking \"SHIT emergency services are going to come, my friends will get scared, and I'm just laying here naked in bed!!\"I cancel everything, and scramble to type in \"phone glitched\" for the reason I'm canceling the SOS, before I scare some 12 emergency contacts.The phone starts ringing and texts start coming in.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)","16":"I'm 18 but still have parental controls+It's not the whole phone only the play store and I've asked my parents to check it and they said it's not an issue on their end and that they have no input on it.

But will they actually keep it up long-term?","21":"Switching back to S23 Ultra after a week with the Oneplus 12+I got the Oneplus 12 because of its DC dimming and higher PWM at lower brightness, but after a week with it, I was itching to switch back to my S23 Ultra. Thoughts:Negatives:1) Nova Launcher doesn't work smoothly with gesture controls, there's a noticeable lag when I swipe to home. I thought it won't be a big deal, but couldn't stand it after a few days. 2) I miss the One Hand Application app for Samsung, that gave me a bunch of side of the screen gesture actions. I tried a few apps off the Google play store but I couldn't find one as reliable. 3) I miss the S pen, good for precise actions, remote camera triggers, and the occasional live sketch. 4a) I found the colors on the Samsung generally more accurate, with the Oneplus giving most photos a warmer tint than irl. Oneplus sometimes seem to have sharper images though, but that might be due to processing. Night photos and videos seem better on the Samsung. 4b) I also miss the 10x camera, which is great for travel and animal photography. 4c) No motion photos on the default oneplus camera app. I like the little snippets of video attached to each photo.5) One UI just feels more polished as an OS, more finalized and less improvised. 6) Samsung Pay turns NFC on and off automatically which seems more secure to me.  Positives1) The screen does feel slightly more comfortable on the OnePlus, so I might switch back to it if my eye strain comes back. I can see the flicker in the Samsung if I wave my fingers across the screen when it's dim.2) I can't seem to get true blacks in dark mode in a few apps on the Samsung, like Instapaper, while the Oneplus has it. 3) Screen off gestures are pretty convenient on the oneplus, especially the torch.4) The oneplus is lighter and less bulky. 5) The haptics are stronger and feel more satisfying on the oneplus. 6) Battery life seems longer and charging is faster. Anyone have thoughts that might make me change my mind again?

The OnePlus 13 already launched in China and some reviewers already made review\/content about it. I will also post those as well here, but I will organize them based on what those videos are. I will also denote the video pre global launch. As usual, if you guys find any videos that I miss, please let me know and I'll put them in the thread. Thanks!","23":"If you have switched from Apple or stayed with Android, tell me why? +I've been a long time android user, but given the rumors about the iPhone 17, I'm considering switching next year. So I'm looking for the reasons people didn't or don't switch over, or reasons why Apple users have switched to android. Thanks! ","24":"System apps that could be uninstalled without breaking any functionality in Samsung devices+I was trying to debloat my Samsung A14 5G device without root using [Canta](https:\/\/github.com\/samolego\/Canta) and [Shizuku](https:\/\/github.com\/RikkaApps\/Shizuku). While trying to find safe apps to remove, I couldn't find any articles online listing bloated apps in OneUI so made one myself, sort of.Listed below all the apps I could uninstall without harming any functionality of Android. I have been using this device for a week and I haven't found any break, in fact it's more responsive now. I tested for general use cases suiting to my use, it might or might not be enough for your Samsung device, but it can be a starting point.    1. com.android.chrome    2. com.aura.oobe.samsung    3. com.facebook.appmanager    4. com.facebook.services    5. com.facebook.system    6. com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess    7. com.google.android.apps.restore    8. com.google.android.apps.tachyon    9. com.google.android.gm    10. com.google.android.healthconnect.controller    11. com.google.android.printservice.recommendation    12. com.google.android.projection.gearhead    13. com.microsoft.skydrive    14. com.mygalaxy    15. com.opera.max.oem    16. com.osp.app.signin    17. com.samsung.SMT    18. com.samsung.android.accessibility.talkback    19. com.samsung.android.alive.service    20. com.samsung.android.app.clockpack    21. com.samsung.android.app.contacts    22. com.samsung.android.app.omcagent    23. com.samsung.android.app.reminder    24. com.samsung.android.app.routines    25. com.samsung.android.app.sharelive    26. com.samsung.android.app.spage    27. com.samsung.android.app.updatecenter    28. com.samsung.android.app.watchmanagerstub    29. com.samsung.android.aremoji    30. com.samsung.android.aremojieditor    31. com.samsung.android.aware.service    32. com.samsung.android.calendar    33. com.samsung.android.easysetuP    34. com.samsung.android.fmm    35. com.samsung.android.game.gamehome    36. com.samsung.android.game.gametools    37. com.samsung.android.gru    38. com.samsung.android.ipsgeofence    39. com.samsung.android.kidsinstaller    40. com.samsung.android.mapsagent    41. com.samsung.android.mdecservice    42. com.samsung.android.mdx.kit    43. com.samsung.android.messaging    44. com.samsung.android.mfi    45. com.samsung.android.mobileservice    46. com.samsung.android.rubin.app    47. com.samsung.android.scloud    48. com.samsung.android.scpm    49. com.samsung.android.scs    50. com.samsung.android.smartcallprovider    51. com.samsung.android.spaymini    52. com.samsung.android.themecenter    53. com.samsung.android.themestore    54. com.samsung.android.uds    55. com.samsung.ecomm.global.in    56. com.samsung.gpuwatchapp    57. com.sec.android.app.SecSetupWizard    58. com.sec.android.app.billing    59. com.sec.android.app.clockpackage    60. com.sec.android.app.fm    61. com.sec.android.app.quicktool    62. com.sec.android.app.samsungapps    63. com.sec.android.daemonapp    64. com.sec.android.easyMover    65. com.sec.android.easyMover.Agent    66. com.sec.android.mimage.avatarstickers    67. com.sec.android.widgetapp.webmanual    68. com.sec.enterprise.knox.cloudmdm.smdms    69. com.sec.location.nsflp2Hope this is helpful.","25":"RCS is now running on iphones with IOS 18 beta+IOS 18 beta is now available to apple users which adds support for RCS messaging. Me and my friends now have a working group chat with replies, typing indicators, reactions, everything! I think it's only for certain carriers for the US possibly restricted to California. I will link the link in the comments my friend used to get the update, send it to your apple friends and enjoy the end of the blue bubbles debate! Edit: I am aware it doesn't change the color of the bubbles, but I think most iPhone users find that aspect dull in comparison to the actual functionality of the green messages (which was the problem)."}}
