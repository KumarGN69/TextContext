"Neutral","Solved: Transfer data from Old Pixel 4a to new Pixel 8a.Greetings,I tried transferring my Pixel 4a data to my new Pixel 8a, and kept failing - was getting ""something went wrong connecting to your device"" message, tried selecting ""transfer from iPhone/iPad"" option and used USB cable, but it did not transfer all my data either.Finally, after several hours of trying, I fixed the issue by **resetting all app preferences on the Pixel 4a (settings>apps>all apps> 3 dots in top right>reset app preferences), enabling bluetooth and location, restarting the Pixel 4a.** (I usually tinker with app permissions quite heavily for privacy reasons, so my guess is that some app did not like this, and the detect nearby device features did not work, or something similar)Then I factory reset the new Pixel 8a, and when prompted to copy data from another Android/Pixel phone on Pixel 8 during the initial setup, there immediately was a prompt on the 4a to start pairing, and it finally worked as expected - this [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVsnt6szjyU)shows how the transfer process ended up being.Final result after about 15 minutes of transfer, all data, including messages and call logs, got transferred over, as expected.Posting it here as the previous posts of people having similar issues got archived, so I could not comment anymore.Hope it helps."
"Neutral","Pixel 8 - really frustrating phone.Really frustrated with pixel. Never will I ever purchase a pixel device again. Such weird problems that it is difficult to explain also. Here's my attempt at listing my problems: 1. Phone is quite chunky and uncomfortable to hold for long hours2. Apps keep crashing. One would not expect Google apps like youtube, gpay, chrome and   Gmail to run smoothly. But every now and then these apps stop performing properly. App opens and shows content, but if  I try to open an email or play video, the apps keeps buffering. Only solution is restarting the phone.3. Every alternate day the media apps stop streaming and which ever content I try to play keeps buffering. Wifi and 5G network, both have same behaviour.4. I use remote desktop to connect to my laptop. The app disconnects and loads the screen again even if I switch apps. This never happened when I used the same app on my samsung tab and earlier oneplus phone5. Weird issues - this happened twice. I took a Teams call from phone and disconnected the call. But the phone still thinks the call is on. Now phone is functioning like it is on call i.e. all sound through phone call speaker only, phone sensors for call is active. Had to restart again.My phone is updated to the latest software and still all issues persists. I hoped that some issues would resolve with updates but have remained disappointed since I purchased this phone. Hope oneplus comes out with a mini phone.No video ever mentions these quirks in the phone. I don't play games on phone or consume media a lot through the day. I saw that phone had performance issues but used to think that they are for people gaming on this phone. Very disappointed with this phone."

"Neutral","Pixel 8 Pro Bluetooth issues.Hello, i changed my Pixel 6 to an new Pixel 8 Pro two weeks ago. Everything were fine until last Monday morning (05.03.2025). Since this day the Bluetooth connection to my phones and the car wont work properly. It has a ridiculously short range of about 1 meter and it will skip and disconnect without reason. I need this phone and the headset the whole day (even for work) so the issues are a serious problem for me.\- The Bluetooth devices work just fine with other phones.\- I updated every software and installed the new Android update (05.03.2025)\- I started everything new and reset the Bluetooth and wifiIs it just a bug with the Pixel / Android and I have to wait for a new bug fix update or can I do something to improve this myself?"

"Neutral","Still no human creation in Pixel Studio after March update P9PF.Just downloaded the March drop for my Pixel 9 Pro fold and updated everything on Play Store. I saw that one of the new features was human creation on the Pixel Studio but for some reason, it is telling me it is still not available and is still coming in the future.Anyone else?Located in Australia if that makes a difference."

"Neutral","Moving pics/videos to hard drive.I have a Google pixel 8pro and also have a pixel book as my computer. I have an old hard drive that I back up my pics and videos to so I can delete from my phone. Yes, I know the cloud exists, this is just my preference. The only way I can find to do the transfer that works is by saving the pics from my phone to a folder on my gdrive, then accessing the drive from my computer and copy and pasting to my hard drive. Takes forever but it works...except for videos. Majority of the videos I can hear sound but can't see anything when I open from my computer. What am I doing wrong?Yes I've tried to use Google photos from my pixel book but that doesn't work for large downloads, and even when downloading a single video from Google photos on the pixel book, the video has nothing to see. SOS EDIT: I appreciate the comments but I think the point is being missed. All these solutions get the pics and videos over but doesn't help the fact that the videos don't have visuals. I'm thinking it may be size related but when I try using a compressor app, the videos don't even show up as an option to compress in the apps. So anywhere besides my phone I just have a black box of audio for all mp4s. "
