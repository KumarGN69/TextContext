Inferior Sound Quality and Interference+Tested on 4 phones side by side: Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 8.All 4 phones running Android 15 QPR Beta 2. Tested performed using the same Pixel Buds Pro earbuds and Pixel A series Buds.  Spatial Audio disabled.Apps used: Spotify, Apple Music, Pocketcasts, Antenna Pod**Result**:  Flawless bluetooth sound quality on Pixel 8 series.  Pixel 9 series lower sound quality, issues with Equalizer function and constant interference and crackling sounds.**Sound Quality**: Equalizer function in both Apple Music and Spotify decreases sound quality/volume in the Pixel 9 series (9 and 9 Pro). On switching the Equalizer ON -  the sound volume actually goes way down. The only way to fix it is to hit the Surround button on the Equalizer drag it to zero.  Keep repeating that until sound increases.  It will again flip back to lower volume, and you have to fiddle with the Surround sound setting again.The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are flawless and have better sound quality and ofcourse no volume decrease using the Equalizer.**Bluetooth Interference and Sound Cutting Out:**   Using both the podcast apps, the sound keeps cutting out intermittently on the 9 Series.  There is also cracking sound many times with volume levels going up and down.  The only way to fix this is to reboot the phone.   Happens quite frequently especially when the phone is in the pocket or covered.Does anyone know whether these are software bugs or are BOTH my Pixel 9 series phones defective?  Thanks in advance!'}"

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""Pixel Buds Pro 2- Unbiased review from someone who's used many earbuds.+So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall. Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!""}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn\'t fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn\'t even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I\'ve always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn\'t really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I\'m kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There\'s a few significant things about this.  First, there\'s going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that\'s out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can\'t do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that\'s something to be aware of if you stray from Google\'s official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I\'m looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it\'s likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can\'t think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I\'m grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There\'s no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google\'s heat mitigation for this year\'s models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don\'t understand why some more technical minded publication hasn\'t run with this yet.  I\'m far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that\'s an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)'}"

First, there\'s going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that\'s out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can\'t do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that\'s something to be aware of if you stray from Google\'s official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I\'m looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it\'s likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can\'t think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I\'m grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There\'s no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google\'s heat mitigation for this year\'s models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don\'t understand why some more technical minded publication hasn\'t run with this yet.  I\'m far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that\'s an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)'}"

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!""}"

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\xa0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\xa0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\xa0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files\xa0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\xa0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\xa0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\xa0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\xa0# 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\xa0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.""}"

My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I\'ve previously taken. - Problems I\'ve had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as ""gimmicky"", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I\'ve been wanting to try more foods, so I\'ll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it\'ll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It\'ll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used ""Add me"" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there\'s finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I\'ve had the buds 3 for about a week and they\'ve been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you\'re on the fence on switching - I\'d suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you\'re worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I\'ve had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds. Full ecosystem! If you have any questions about the switch, let me know! '}"

I\'d be at work with my phone sitting next to me all day with no notifications. Next time I turn my screen on, I get hit with multiple notifications, including texts, sometimes hours late. My wife says calls sometimes go straight to voicemail, meaning she literally cannot reach me in the event of an emergency. And when I can receive calls, the call quality is sometimes so bad that I can barely understand what she\'s saying.I\'ve done some searching on Reddit and elsewhere and it seems I\'m not alone. For every proposed solution, there\'s a dozen people immediately replying that it doesn\'t work, which leaves me rather hopeless.On top of that, the Pixel Watch\'s crown broke off with in the first month.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.""}"

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn\'t fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn\'t even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I\'ve always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn\'t really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I\'m kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There\'s a few significant things about this.  First, there\'s going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that\'s out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can\'t do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that\'s something to be aware of if you stray from Google\'s official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I\'m looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it\'s likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can\'t think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!'}"

As of this post, it’s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM — and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It’s a small touch, but a cool one — and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn’t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it’s the best phone I’ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it’s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it’s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There’s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad 😅), but there’s no phantom touch issues, so it’s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I’ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition — it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! 👏Anyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences?

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one\'s mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn\'t even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let\'s consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let\'s look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that\'s usually how 30x is. I don\'t consider it that usable. Considering you\'re looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn\'t touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let\'s look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I\'m used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It\'s really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There\'s some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there\'s far more detail. Again, here\'s the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There\'s too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it\'s not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI.'}"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \xa0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\xa0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.'}"

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. /rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly.""}"

Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don\'t know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I\'ve had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a\'s speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don\'t play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don\'t notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don\'t care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I\'d be using it all the time, I haven\'t used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven\'t had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it\'s the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I\'ve used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn\'t great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven\'t used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven\'t had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don\'t really use), but overall, I don\'t feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It\'s all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel\'s white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia\'s camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don\'t care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a\'s camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it\'s pretty useless. At least, I haven\'t had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I\'ll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel\'s 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a\'s video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a\'s LED light is weaker, the 4a\'s is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it\'s smaller? The 8a\'s haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel\'s vibration motor to the 4a\'s haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven\'t tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I\'ve ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don\'t need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven\'t tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven\'t found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don\'t know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a\'s 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don\'t know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don\'t really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it\'s the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well.""}"

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn\'t fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn\'t even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I\'ve always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn\'t really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I\'m kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There\'s a few significant things about this.  First, there\'s going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that\'s out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can\'t do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that\'s something to be aware of if you stray from Google\'s official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I\'m looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it\'s likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can\'t think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I\'m grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There\'s no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google\'s heat mitigation for this year\'s models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don\'t understand why some more technical minded publication hasn\'t run with this yet.  I\'m far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that\'s an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)'}"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \xa0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\xa0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.'}"

Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\xa0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\xa0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\xa0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\xa0# 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\xa0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.""}"

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it.'}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far+I\'ve had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don\'t know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I\'ve had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a\'s speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don\'t play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don\'t notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don\'t care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I\'d be using it all the time, I haven\'t used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven\'t had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it\'s the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I\'ve used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn\'t great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven\'t used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven\'t had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don\'t really use), but overall, I don\'t feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It\'s all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel\'s white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia\'s camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don\'t care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a\'s camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it\'s pretty useless. At least, I haven\'t had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I\'ll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel\'s 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a\'s video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a\'s LED light is weaker, the 4a\'s is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it\'s smaller? The 8a\'s haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel\'s vibration motor to the 4a\'s haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven\'t tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I\'ve ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don\'t need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven\'t tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven\'t found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don\'t know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a\'s 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don\'t know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don\'t really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it\'s the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['User Experience, Technical'], 'user_review': 'Tried Pixel 9; it is smooth, much smoother than Pixel 8+There are those who notice stutter, and then there are those for whom the Pixel 8 is perfectly smooth. I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that ""120Hz smoothness"" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8\'s UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the ""Pro"" models. In conclusion, if you were concerned with the stuttering, I am happy to report, there is no issue with it. I only tried one unit so far, but it was much, much better than Pixel 8.'}"

The XL only being 40€ more expensive after calculating in the bigger discount on the watch + more cashback really makes this even harder.

I started with the Nexus line, and I´ve upgrading yearly from the Pixel 5. I love Pixel phones, but lately I started to doubt if it was a good time to test iPhone again (had one many years ago). I´m and iPad user (media and reading), so I know iOS quite well. I also work on Mac. The iPhone 16 Pro is a nice device. I feel it´s more fluid than my actual Pixel 8 Pro, and without some annoyances, being:\\- Occasional stuttering when scrolling on X/Twitter or some other feeds.\\- Password Manager autofill not working reliable (Bitwarden). I´ve tried Proton Pass and same result. \\- Portrait mode is bad, even editing afterwards in Google Photos, or at least not as good as iPhone.\\- Whatsapp calling not turning off the screen, causing false screen touches. Very annoying. All my calls are within Whatsapp. All of the above work flawlessly on the iPhone, at least in my last 3 weeks with it. However, I miss all the rest my Pixel has, like:\\- Notifications control, like sending to Watch Later directly from the YouTube notification, and how Android treats notifications in all. \\- Keyboard GBoard\\- AI features\\- Back Gesture\\- Camara is better, at least color rendering. I´m going back and forth on my decision if keeping the iPhone (which also means Airpods and Watch), or keeping my old love with Pixel and going for the 9 Pro. '}"

Pixel 8 pro to pixel 9 pro Xl+Listen, I upgraded recently to the pixel 9 pro XL. Do not upgrade. I repeat do not upgrade. Do not listen to the fan boys. There is no difference for the most part between the phones and definitely not worth the price increase. I will start off by addressing signal. It's actually worse for me. Places my 8 pro never dropped signal, the 9 pro XL is dropping. Don't let them lie to you about it being a lemon. It's my second one. It's just the phone. Do not upgrade. Trust me! I'm not a fan boy. I love all tech. The speakers on the pixel 8 pro are louder, I repeat they are louder and more full. I placed them side by side because the 9 pro XL sounded too low. Heat: this phone has heated up to the same degree as the 8 pro, I repeat they are the same. Please don't let them lie to you. The battery life is the same (6-8 hours sot). The 9 pro XL is a tad bit smoother and faster but not noticable in everyday usage. It's a waste of money with no benefit unless you take selfies, which I do not. The front facing camera is better. One thing that did surprise me is how good the 9 pro XL feels to hold in the hand. I'm 6'4 and the 9 pro XL is more comfortable to hold them then the 8 pro. The video on the 9 pro XL is worse than the 8 pro for some reason. Pictures are roughly similar. Please don't upgrade unless you get a really good deal. This is not an upgrade. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is not faster than Samsung's on the 24 ultra. It feels slightly better than the 8 pro's optical, but barely. Do not let them trick y'all. Any questions of somebody on the fence I will answer honestly. Do not listen to people lying! My signal is worse than the 8 pro, sorry! Modem is not fixed. My s24 ultra has better signal than both of these phones. Run Run! It's not a horrible phone, but definitely not worth the price increase. It's a $800 phone at best.""}"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \xa0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\xa0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.'}"

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!'}"

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\xa0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\xa0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\xa0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files\xa0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\xa0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\xa0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\xa0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\xa0# 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\xa0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.""}"

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it.'}"

TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly.""}"

Here are my observations so far+I\'ve had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don\'t know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I\'ve had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a\'s speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don\'t play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don\'t notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don\'t care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I\'d be using it all the time, I haven\'t used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven\'t had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it\'s the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I\'ve used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn\'t great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven\'t used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven\'t had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don\'t really use), but overall, I don\'t feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It\'s all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel\'s white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia\'s camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don\'t care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a\'s camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it\'s pretty useless. At least, I haven\'t had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I\'ll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel\'s 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a\'s video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a\'s LED light is weaker, the 4a\'s is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it\'s smaller? The 8a\'s haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel\'s vibration motor to the 4a\'s haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven\'t tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I\'ve ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don\'t need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven\'t tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven\'t found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don\'t know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a\'s 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don\'t know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don\'t really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it\'s the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""The things I like about Android+Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well.""}"

It was great for the first couple weeks. I\'ve enjoyed the battery life and camera quality on the phone. But starting a few weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing calls and texts. I\'d be at work with my phone sitting next to me all day with no notifications. Next time I turn my screen on, I get hit with multiple notifications, including texts, sometimes hours late. My wife says calls sometimes go straight to voicemail, meaning she literally cannot reach me in the event of an emergency. And when I can receive calls, the call quality is sometimes so bad that I can barely understand what she\'s saying.I\'ve done some searching on Reddit and elsewhere and it seems I\'m not alone. For every proposed solution, there\'s a dozen people immediately replying that it doesn\'t work, which leaves me rather hopeless.On top of that, the Pixel Watch\'s crown broke off with in the first month. No idea what happened. Just looked down one day and noticed it was gone. Thankfully I was able to get a replacement under warranty pretty quickly, but the warranty process was rather frustrating. When I tried explain that the crown broke off but the screen still works fine, the customer service rep straight up did not comprehend why I wanted a replacement. If it ""works fine"" why do you need a new one? Ugh. The battery life is terrible, barely lasting a day even with battery saver on.I don\'t know what to do.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it.'}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn\'t fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn\'t even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I\'ve always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn\'t really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I\'m kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There\'s a few significant things about this.  First, there\'s going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that\'s out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can\'t do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that\'s something to be aware of if you stray from Google\'s official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I\'m looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it\'s likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can\'t think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I\'m grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There\'s no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google\'s heat mitigation for this year\'s models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don\'t understand why some more technical minded publication hasn\'t run with this yet.  I\'m far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that\'s an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \xa0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\xa0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.'}"

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!'}"

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one\'s mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn\'t even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let\'s consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let\'s look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that\'s usually how 30x is. I don\'t consider it that usable. Considering you\'re looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn\'t touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let\'s look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I\'m used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It\'s really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There\'s some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there\'s far more detail. Again, here\'s the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There\'s too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it\'s not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI.'}"

Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

Here are the results.+*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\xa0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\xa0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\xa0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\xa0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens. *Update 1* July 3rdAfter the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.*Update 2* July 4As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.*Update 3* July 5I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.*Update 4*  July 6The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.*Conclusion*It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That\'s why we\'ve raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus\' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch\'s intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user\'s mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone\'s camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you\'re at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here\'s everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1299.99 for the 256GB storage model.The Galaxy S25 series is available for pre-order starting today, and will be released for general availability on February 7.## Galaxy S25 series full specs| Spec                    | Galaxy S25                                                                                                        | Galaxy S25+                                                                                                                    | Galaxy S25 Ultra                                                                                                                                                   || :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || Colors                  | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                             | Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver                                                                                                     || Screen                  | 6.2"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                | 6.7"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                          | 6.9"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                                                                 || Main Camera -

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop'], 'user_review': 'Here\'s everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here\'s everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1299.99 for the 256GB storage model.The Galaxy S25 series is available for pre-order starting today, and will be released for general availability on February 7.## Galaxy S25 series full specs| Spec                    | Galaxy S25                                                                                                        | Galaxy S25+                                                                                                                    | Galaxy S25 Ultra                                                                                                                                                   || :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || Colors                  | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                             | Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver                                                                                                     || Screen                  | 6.2"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                | 6.7"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                          | 6.9"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                                                                 || Main Camera -

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Service, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Here\'s everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A+My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. ""}"

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices.""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android\'s screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it\'s ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can\'t do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It\'s the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that\'s it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don\'t think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android\'s quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS\' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS\' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it\'s like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it\'s not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don\'t get a cropper tool magnification, so you can\'t position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let\'s say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can\'t see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can\'t see what\'s under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can\'t where you\'re really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here\'s what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office\'s magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android\'s own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It\'s very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it\'s a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google\'s app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you\'ve over-scrolling it\'s like you\'re looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality'], 'user_review': 'What\'s responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?+I\'ve had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I\'d ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don\'t count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn\'t meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What\'s responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven\'t been very active in the smartphone space, and I\'ve only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which\'s both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I\'m not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what\'s easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI/UX elements is a pain, it doesn\'t have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can\'t customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn\'t available by default.My argument: The decline in ""flagship"" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I\'ll be using the Samsung S8 as the ""old"" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the ""normal"" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there\'s now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water/dust resistance hasn\'t changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn\'t changed, I would expect if you\'re trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you\'re at least \\*trying\\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn\'t happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have ""extra space"" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn\'t feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don\'t support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a ""flagship"" phone really isn\'t a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn\'t settled at 32-bit/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it\'s still possible to buy a ""flagship"" phone with DAC that doesn\'t meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for ""security concerns"" (which are valid, except that these ""security concerns"" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta/experimental build (can\'t remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn\'t considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN/password is entered, the orientation/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often/with what parameters you need to use a PIN/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom/3rd party launchers, it doesn\'t have anywhere near the same support for installing custom/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification/utility panel), navigation bars, ""recent apps"" screens, or other integral UI/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn\'t allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called ""navbar"") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification/utility panel) (the app I use is called ""oneshade"") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \\*mostly\\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven\'t seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \\*can\\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I\'ve noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a ""flagship"" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with ""flagship"" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren\'t making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren\'t pushing what\'s possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn\'t necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a ""flagship"" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn\'t much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the ""solution"" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you\'re trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I\'ve heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory ""capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first"" to the theory of ""this isn\'t actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things"" and I\'m genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I\'m especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules/policy, please let me know and I\'ll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely.'}"

It's extremely smooth and fast in comparison to my aging Oppo A91. However, there are a couple of features that I wish Google could bring from their rivals:1. **Floating windows.** This is perhaps, the feature that I miss the most. I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting the screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly, you have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on/off the device.** This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega/giga bytes consumed per day.** I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.**\xa0This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app? I sometimes get several notifications from Duolingo, but they are always split. I wish I could have all of them coming from one app in one place instead of several.Thanks for any comments or suggestions if you have any.""}"

I got a Unihertz Titan pocket recently as part of my ""dumb smartphone"" experiment and I am starting to grow to love it. Some little things it does which are not possible/difficult in ios* Recording Whatsapp video calls along with audio - In IOS, due to meta restrictions I think, only the video part is recorded and never the audio. This frustrates me as I frequently video call with my little niece and want to record all the video calls. * Minimalistic launchers - Again part of my ""digital detox"" strategy. I love the fact that you simply install a new launcher and can make it so minimalistic that it turns you off from picking up the phone and doom scrolling* Split screen - Although it\'s kinda unusable on such a small screen on my android phone, it\'s nice to know that if I ever switch to a larger screen android, I have this wonderful option'}"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders""}"

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

Real life problems when moving to android there is no solution for. +Ok, I finally convinced my wife to bin apple off and get a pixel 9 phone. So far the voice to text is better. But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life / wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc / payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this 🤣 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue. Every time a Bluetooth device powers off the audio just stops, I'm using the same apps, audible, Everand etc. ""}"

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)""}"

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions.

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android\'s screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it\'s ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can\'t do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It\'s the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that\'s it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don\'t think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android\'s quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS\' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS\' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it\'s like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it\'s not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don\'t get a cropper tool magnification, so you can\'t position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let\'s say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can\'t see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can\'t see what\'s under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can\'t where you\'re really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here\'s what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office\'s magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android\'s own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It\'s very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it\'s a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google\'s app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you\'ve over-scrolling it\'s like you\'re looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here\'s everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment]+I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.Usecase 1) -\xa0**Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -**\xa0I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away.\xa0***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.***\xa0I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread -\xa0[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1)Usecase 2) -\xa0**Standardized gestures to move back -**\xa0iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.Usecase 3) -\xa0**Selecting files/images -**\xa0Selecting multiple images/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.Usecase 4) -\xa0**Blocking spam message senders -**\xa0Most of us get probably dozens of spam/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.Usecase 5) -\xa0**View images/documents on Files app -**\xa0Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page -\xa0[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best)It seems to be happening on ipads as well.So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience. ""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop'], 'user_review': 'OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3+*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn\'t published this press release anywhere, so I\'m pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  ---  *Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google***New York, NY, February 18, 2025** – Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That\'s why we\'ve raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus\' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch\'s intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user\'s mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone\'s camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you\'re at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

The content remains the same—just easier to follow. If you would rather see my poorly written review DM me lol. Original post:I was initially skeptical of the widespread criticism surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but after receiving my 1TB model, I quickly understood the frustration. I had planned to trade in my Galaxy S22 for $600, expecting a substantial upgrade. However, after testing the S25 Ultra, I found the differences to be minimal—certain aspects even felt like a downgrade.Underwhelming Improvements for a Premium PriceWith a starting price of $1,400, I expected significant enhancements, but the S25 Ultra left me unimpressed. The phone doesn’t feel noticeably faster, and the cameras actually seem to perform worse than previous models. The macro photography, which I was particularly excited about, was a letdown—my old Note 5 captured better close-up shots. Additionally, Samsung removed Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, reducing its versatility.Samsung’s AI Promises Were MisleadingSamsung heavily marketed AI as the defining feature of the S25 Ultra, claiming during its launch event that all AI processing could be done locally on the device. This turned out to be misleading. Even after enabling the ""local AI"" setting to keep data on-device, I found that many features still required cloud access to function. This raises privacy concerns and contradicts Samsung’s core marketing message.AI and Image Generation Fell FlatBeyond the misleading AI claims, the phone’s generative image features were disappointing. Samsung positioned AI as the main selling point of the S25 Ultra, yet the execution feels rushed and underdeveloped. Instead of true AI innovation, it seems like Samsung is simply riding the AI hype train without delivering a meaningful user experience.Not Enough to Justify the Price TagAt $1,400 and up, the S25 Ultra needed to bring substantial improvements, but it doesn’t. This release feels more like an incremental iPhone-style update—something unexpected from Samsung, which was once known for pushing boundaries. Rather than innovating, they seem to be cutting corners while relying on AI buzzwords.For the first time ever, I’m returning a Samsung device. If you decided to keep your old phone instead of upgrading, let me know in the comments.'}"

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders""}"

OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you’re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I’ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it’s easy to switch between the two.2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google’s Circle to Search feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgOP6XMAAQHEb?format=jpg&name=large) to OnePlus phones, finally.4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It’ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it’ll basically let you ask questions like “how much is my next phone bill?” and then it’ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing…but honestly it seems like it’s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently? In any case, your OnePlus phone now has Android’s Theft Protection feature, so go turn ‘em on.""}"

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

I’ve included a description of each app/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn’t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https://i.imgur.com/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https://i.imgur.com/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn’t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn’t able to get notes to sync reliably. It’s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can’t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn’t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https://i.imgur.com/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https://i.imgur.com/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https://i.imgur.com/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https://i.imgur.com/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https://i.imgur.com/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It’s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn’t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https://i.imgur.com/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https://i.imgur.com/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https://i.imgur.com/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn’t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https://i.imgur.com/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It’s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn’t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google’s desktop Quick Share app](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https://i.imgur.com/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there’s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https://i.imgur.com/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren’t. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https://i.imgur.com/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https://i.imgur.com/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https://i.imgur.com/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https://i.imgur.com/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It’s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https://i.imgur.com/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https://i.imgur.com/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https://i.imgur.com/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works. It makes sense since those are all Chromium-based browsers.""}"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop'], 'user_review': 'Here\'s everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A+My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. ""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""Android should really change how it works+As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn’t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting—the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument.""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, Call drop\nUser Experience, Service, Support, Others'], 'user_review': ""ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro - Buyer Beware+Let me know if this needs to go elsewhere, but after doing quite a bit of searching here and across the web, there aren't many places to actually leave reviews for this device, including ASUS' own site. I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign""}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android\'s screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it\'s ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can\'t do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It\'s the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that\'s it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don\'t think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android\'s quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS\' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS\' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it\'s like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it\'s not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don\'t get a cropper tool magnification, so you can\'t position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let\'s say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can\'t see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can\'t see what\'s under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can\'t where you\'re really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here\'s what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office\'s magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android\'s own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It\'s very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it\'s a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google\'s app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you\'ve over-scrolling it\'s like you\'re looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions+I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https://oukitel.com/products/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the ""Force full GNSS measurements"" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone.'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus+In case it matters, I\'m in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I\'ve had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided ""No Samsung"" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I\'m finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus\'s ""Smart Panel"" is both better and worse than Samsung\'s Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy\'s does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy\'s Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I\'m used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It\'s a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren\'t, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here\'s hoping.'}"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3+*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn\'t published this press release anywhere, so I\'m pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  ---  *Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google***New York, NY, February 18, 2025** – Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That\'s why we\'ve raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus\' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch\'s intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user\'s mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone\'s camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here\'s everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders""}"

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

I’ve included a description of each app/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn’t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https://i.imgur.com/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https://i.imgur.com/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn’t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn’t able to get notes to sync reliably. It’s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can’t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn’t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https://i.imgur.com/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https://i.imgur.com/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https://i.imgur.com/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https://i.imgur.com/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https://i.imgur.com/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It’s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn’t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https://i.imgur.com/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https://i.imgur.com/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https://i.imgur.com/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn’t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https://i.imgur.com/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It’s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn’t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google’s desktop Quick Share app](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https://i.imgur.com/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there’s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https://i.imgur.com/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren’t. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https://i.imgur.com/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https://i.imgur.com/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https://i.imgur.com/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https://i.imgur.com/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It’s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https://i.imgur.com/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https://i.imgur.com/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https://i.imgur.com/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works. It makes sense since those are all Chromium-based browsers.""}"

Real life problems when moving to android there is no solution for. +Ok, I finally convinced my wife to bin apple off and get a pixel 9 phone. So far the voice to text is better. But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life / wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc / payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this 🤣 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue. Every time a Bluetooth device powers off the audio just stops, I'm using the same apps, audible, Everand etc. ""}"

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. ""}"

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)""}"

I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now. I have more stuff I\'ll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)'}"
"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': ""A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices.""}"

And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android\'s screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it\'s ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can\'t do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It\'s the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that\'s it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don\'t think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android\'s quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS\' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS\' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it\'s like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it\'s not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don\'t get a cropper tool magnification, so you can\'t position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let\'s say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can\'t see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can\'t see what\'s under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can\'t where you\'re really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here\'s what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office\'s magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android\'s own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It\'s very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it\'s a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google\'s app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you\'ve over-scrolling it\'s like you\'re looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?'}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we\'ll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It\'s sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn\'t go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I\'ll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don\'t know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn\'t TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it\'s there but I disabled it because it doesn\'t work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else'}"

I know a lot of folks here don\'t like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here\'s a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android\'s action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren\'t working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there\'s now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here\'s [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it\'s more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you\'re not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This\'ll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren\'t playing any media. It\'s still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That\'s all for now.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary.""}"

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. ""}"

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)""}"

"{'sentiment': 'positive', 'categories': ['Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call Drop'], 'user_review': 'This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android\'s screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it\'s ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can\'t do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It\'s the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that\'s it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don\'t think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android\'s quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS\' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS\' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it\'s like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it\'s not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don\'t get a cropper tool magnification, so you can\'t position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let\'s say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can\'t see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can\'t see what\'s under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can\'t where you\'re really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here\'s what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office\'s magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android\'s own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It\'s very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it\'s a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google\'s app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you\'ve over-scrolling it\'s like you\'re looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?'}"
