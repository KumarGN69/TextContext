negative,"[' Audio Issues: audio, sound']","Bluetooth Issues Pixel 9 Series: P9ProXL and Pixel 9.  Inferior Sound Quality and Interference+Tested on 4 phones side by side: Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 8.All 4 phones running Android 15 QPR Beta 2. Tested performed using the same Pixel Buds Pro earbuds and Pixel A series Buds.  Spatial Audio disabled.Apps used: Spotify, Apple Music, Pocketcasts, Antenna Pod**Result**:  Flawless bluetooth sound quality on Pixel 8 series.  Pixel 9 series lower sound quality, issues with Equalizer function and constant interference and crackling sounds.**Sound Quality**: Equalizer function in both Apple Music and Spotify decreases sound quality/volume in the Pixel 9 series (9 and 9 Pro). On switching the Equalizer ON -  the sound volume actually goes way down. The only way to fix it is to hit the Surround button on the Equalizer drag it to zero.  Keep repeating that until sound increases.  It will again flip back to lower volume, and you have to fiddle with the Surround sound setting again.The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are flawless and have better sound quality and ofcourse no volume decrease using the Equalizer.**Bluetooth Interference and Sound Cutting Out:**   Using both the podcast apps, the sound keeps cutting out intermittently on the 9 Series.  There is also cracking sound many times with volume levels going up and down.  The only way to fix this is to reboot the phone.   Happens quite frequently especially when the phone is in the pocket or covered.Does anyone know whether these are software bugs or are BOTH my Pixel 9 series phones defective?  Thanks in advance!"

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Bluetooth']","Pixel Buds Pro 2- Unbiased review from someone who's used many earbuds.+So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall. Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"

To be honest, I'm shocked how piss poor the video quality is when uploaded from the Pixel. I did a side by side comparison on Tik Tok with the exact same settings. The colors are much better on the iPhone, much smoother, way less noise and the STABILIZATION...? It looks like my Pixel is attached to a spacecraft when I do recordings where I move a bit.Also, just in the preview with 50 MP the screen lags all the time. The pictures looks way worse before I shoot em, and good after when I check in my photo folder. Why is it like that?Just scrolling on these apps is way slower and way less smooth on the Pixel. From time to time the videos on TT even just stops randomly.Will this ever be fixed?EDIT: Just did a new test now, the recordings on Tik Tok is literally shaking on the top and bottom of the footage. Seriously?"
negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop, Others']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Service, Support, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy+What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!"

As of this post, it’s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM — and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It’s a small touch, but a cool one — and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn’t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it’s the best phone I’ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it’s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it’s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There’s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad 😅), but there’s no phantom touch issues, so it’s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I’ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition — it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! 👏Anyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences?

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."

It seems like a dumb little thing, but that black bar at the bottom really screamed cheap to me. - No jagged edges and small gaps where panels meet. On the Pixel 7 everywhere there is a change in direction/material there is a sharp edge and a small gap your fingernail can catch on. The Pixel 9 Pro is nearly seamless and feels like solid block that is comfortable to hold. - The USB port is a perfect fit for cables and they click in for a perfect fit.

The [YouTuber InDepth Tech Reviews](https://youtu.be/ah6LMIvf5SQ) has also noticed this same behaviour from the 9 Pro. Hopefully this is something that can be drawn to Google's attention and corrected with software, as it seems to be a software issue causing it. But i'm pretty bummed that even at its current best the 9 Pro isn't as good at night zoom as the 8 Pro, which is weird because in daylight zoom photography I've noticed the 9 Pro to be the better one.

And I keep the screen always at lower brightness than I would like.- Overheating: It's true that we are experiencing hotter summer than ever, but when outside the camera app makes it overheat SO quickly. I've had the device turning off for overheat while I was taking a video(and I was inside a house)...now I just ""let it rest"" for a few minutes when I feel it is overheating.- Modem: always been crappy, especially for people travelling in different regions of the world, the pixel is not the device to own. Happy that they've given up and the Pixel 9 modem will be Samsung made.- Software-based locked/removed features just to make the Pixel 8 Pro more enticing (as if the Pixel 8 is a cheap entry model ).I don't know how to evaluate new devices anymore, every time a new device comes out it seems like the perfect device with incredible reviews, but the reality is that I had a better experience on my Pixel 5."

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

negative,"[' Audio, Experience, Technical (audio, sound, experience)']","Pixel Buds Pro 2- Unbiased review from someone who's used many earbuds.+So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall. Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"

It looks like my Pixel is attached to a spacecraft when I do recordings where I move a bit.Also, just in the preview with 50 MP the screen lags all the time.

negative,"[' Others, Technical, Video, Display']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!"

As of this post, it’s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM — and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It’s a small touch, but a cool one — and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn’t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it’s the best phone I’ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it’s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it’s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There’s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad 😅), but there’s no phantom touch issues, so it’s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I’ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition — it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! 👏Anyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences? Drop a comment — I’d love to hear your stories!"

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."

I'm upgrading from the Pixel 7 and it's just a lot of little things that add up to a better feel:- Uniform borders around the screen. It seems like a dumb little thing, but that black bar at the bottom really screamed cheap to me. - No jagged edges and small gaps where panels meet. On the Pixel 7 everywhere there is a change in direction/material there is a sharp edge and a small gap your fingernail can catch on. The Pixel 9 Pro is nearly seamless and feels like solid block that is comfortable to hold. - The USB port is a perfect fit for cables and they click in for a perfect fit. The Pixel 7 has a slightly oversized port and cables always felt loose (even when secured fully.)"

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"

I will say some stuff I love so far is + Design, the Hazel is stellar + Google makes everything ""easy"", it's well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over + Google ecosystem works great for productivity + Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer+ Customization but won't get into it as everyone knows this already + Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly, while apple recently has been trending opposite.+ Cost to package ratio.

On android 15- Google photos just isn't as seamless as iCloud photos imo, it syncs inconsistently for me- switching between cameras is VERY choppy - app performance, I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple, the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable, whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you don't feel much of a difference "

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown: \*\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app) # 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on. # 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files # 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers. # 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet. # 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!) # 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons. # 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows. # 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\*\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."

My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I've previously taken. - Problems I've had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as ""gimmicky"", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I've been wanting to try more foods, so I'll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it'll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It'll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used ""Add me"" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there's finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I've had the buds 3 for about a week and they've been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you're on the fence on switching - I'd suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you're worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I've had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds. Full ecosystem! If you have any questions about the switch, let me know! "

It was great for the first couple weeks. I've enjoyed the battery life and camera quality on the phone. But starting a few weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing calls and texts. I'd be at work with my phone sitting next to me all day with no notifications. Next time I turn my screen on, I get hit with multiple notifications, including texts, sometimes hours late. My wife says calls sometimes go straight to voicemail, meaning she literally cannot reach me in the event of an emergency. And when I can receive calls, the call quality is sometimes so bad that I can barely understand what she's saying.I've done some searching on Reddit and elsewhere and it seems I'm not alone. For every proposed solution, there's a dozen people immediately replying that it doesn't work, which leaves me rather hopeless.On top of that, the Pixel Watch's crown broke off with in the first month. No idea what happened. Just looked down one day and noticed it was gone. Thankfully I was able to get a replacement under warranty pretty quickly, but the warranty process was rather frustrating. When I tried explain that the crown broke off but the screen still works fine, the customer service rep straight up did not comprehend why I wanted a replacement. If it ""works fine"" why do you need a new one? Ugh. The battery life is terrible, barely lasting a day even with battery saver on.I don't know what to do. I really don't want to ditch the phone so soon after I bought it, but I also can't just be totally unreachable 8 hours a day.

It seems the accuracy for a lot of services is better under a pixel phone. I wear a mechanical watch daily and only use a smart watch for workouts.When using Google maps or Apple Maps it seems like a lot of stuff is smoother on the pixel. I have the iPhone 15 Pro Max and a pixel nine Pro XL.

I started with the Nexus line, and I´ve upgrading yearly from the Pixel 5. I love Pixel phones, but lately I started to doubt if it was a good time to test iPhone again (had one many years ago). I´m and iPad user (media and reading), so I know iOS quite well. I also work on Mac. The iPhone 16 Pro is a nice device. I feel it´s more fluid than my actual Pixel 8 Pro, and without some annoyances, being:\- Occasional stuttering when scrolling on X/Twitter or some other feeds.\- Password Manager autofill not working reliable (Bitwarden). I´ve tried Proton Pass and same result. \- Portrait mode is bad, even editing afterwards in Google Photos, or at least not as good as iPhone.\- Whatsapp calling not turning off the screen, causing false screen touches. Very annoying. All my calls are within Whatsapp. All of the above work flawlessly on the iPhone, at least in my last 3 weeks with it. However, I miss all the rest my Pixel has, like:\- Notifications control, like sending to Watch Later directly from the YouTube notification, and how Android treats notifications in all. \- Keyboard GBoard\- AI features\- Back Gesture\- Camara is better, at least color rendering. I´m going back and forth on my decision if keeping the iPhone (which also means Airpods and Watch), or keeping my old love with Pixel and going for the 9 Pro. "

Especially the ""a"" series?+(I'll mainly talk about the Indian market cuz I don't have any idea how it's pricing is in other countries)Pixel Phones are really good and minimal with that classic stock  Android. But the pricing of pixel Phones are really weird. Like, why does the normal variant of every Pixel Phones when launched costs over 80k rs? (I think for whatever it's offering, 50-60k should be good enough for that).The Fold and the Pro version are understandable, as they'll price higher. But the Pro version also should not be priced above 1 Lakh I believe?And even after that, if we talk about the a series, It's meant to be a mid ranger right? Then why the hell it's pricing reaches above 30k?Like they get priced mostly above 40-50k when launched.Whatever the pixel a series phones offer, they shouldn't be priced above 30-35k at all normally. Even with the that many years of OS updates policy.Cuz other than the great camera and stock android and update support, everything else is pretty much normal and it makes it more overpriced. The base series and a series are nonsensely priced I believe. Okay. Some one said I should make my point more clear. Right. As per Nothing and Samsung (won't talk about Motorola but it can also be considered here), they all are non Chinese phones and all of them kinda gives that premium vibe. But look at Samsung. They have Ultra models pricing more than a Lakh rs, and they have very cheap budget models aswell. They have proper midrange phones which also provides around 4-5 years of OS Upgrades, good performance and also a great camera all that with good after sales service and? They are perfectly priced very often (if you're not talking about the S Fe series).Then look at Nothing. They are also doing the same. Although less os upgrades comparatively, they are also giving near stock android experience with their own touch. And they are performing really good. They have an upper midrange series (which is kinda overpriced too).But? Their budget series (which is also a series) are perfectly priced around 23k to 28k rs at launch including the upgraded + models. And? They also have a budget series which is also a very great choice called CMF PHONE 1. And it's performing well in the budget segment too! Although less features, still a great experience!Same with Motorola aswell.Even though Pixel phones are kinda overpriced as per what they offer (and yes! They do get down in price after a bit time later of release), their a series is also meant to feature less features and it does! And it should be priced not more than 30k-35k even at launch imo.Idk how it is sold in other countries tho. This is a reason why in comparison to these premium brands, Google Pixel still sucks in terms of pricing, especially their Midrange a series. "
negative,"[' Audio Issues: audio, sound']","Pixel Buds Pro 2 v Airpods Pro 2 (an amateur review for those interested in reading this)+After switching fully from an iPhone 12 to a Pixel 9, I leaned in hard on the switch and got the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The quality of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (in both sound and usability) is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Airpod Pros 2. I'm no tech guru but as an average consumer (who listens to music while doing admin work in the office or while running outdoors), the sound quality on these things (Pixel Buds Pro 2) is magnificent. The bass quality had me dancing almost right away. And the noise cancellation works SO well.As far as usability is concerned, it always drove me nuts on the Airpod Pros 2 whenever I'd need to switch songs while I was out for a run. I hated having to squeeze both sides of an airpod multiple times just to change a song, go back, or pause. Perhaps it's just me or the shape of my ears but whenever I would squeeze the airpod, I'd have to quickly re-adjust the airpod in my ear. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 **are so simple to use** -a quick tap on the outside of the bud does the job! Accessing Google Assistant or enabling Noise Cancellation feels so easy to do.Also, I love that there are color variations to choose from on the Pixel buds! This may not be important for everyone but it is to me.It was worth every penny switching over to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 from the Airpod Pros 2! If both the Pixel Buds and Airpods worked well on iPhones, I'd still always choose the Pixel Buds (not that I ever plan to go back to an iPhone after the P9). I hope you liked my review. Have a great day!"

negative,"[' experience, user, service, support']","Am I mistreating my phones somehow? Third Pixel to bite the dust+I've always loved the clean UX and overall flexibility of these phones, but it just feels foolish to keep buying a premium phone that will only last a couple of years before becoming unusable.Started with a 2XL, which was a pleasure to use. Power button started having trouble about a year and a half in, and the charging port got wonky shortly thereafter. Fine, I can understand the early iterations having some things to work on, and I wouldn't be surprised if I bent the charger by accident somehow.Decided to try the 5a next, since I was strapped for cash at the time. It was adequate, though notably laggy at times. Made sure to put a heavy-duty case on it and keep the ports protected, since it wasn't rated as well for moisture, dust, etc. Despite being very easy on it, this one just straight-up bricked about two years after getting it. Completely unrecoverable. It was diagnosed as a motherboard issue.So I thought I'd learned my lesson and decided to go for the premium model again with a 7 Pro. Great performance, a killer camera, and my only minor gripes usually get fixed with updates. It overheats too easily, but whatever.  AGAIN, it's been less than two years and it's got some kind of internal hardware problem. Bricks itself randomly, won't turn on for hours at a time (even in safe mode, regardless of charge). The first time it did it, it was off for so long that I thought it was completely fried. Magically turned on by itself a few hours later. Would work for a few minutes or an hour or a day, then repeat the process. I didn't have any issues for a few months, and it just started doing it again over the past few days. It's completely unreliable, and I'm just waiting for the day it's going to strand me or make me miss something important for work. I'm currently praying it will turn back on in a few hours.Is this just bad luck? I always use cases that are well-rated for drop protection. I keep the software up-to-date. Heck, I've even done a factory reset roughly every year as preventative maintenance/ housekeeping. I'm not visiting any sketchy websites or downloading anything wild.I can only think of two things I've done that might be or have been detrimental:  I fidget by tapping on my phone in my pocket sometimes. Not like beating the crap out of it or anything, just tapping. Nothing harder than if you were excitedly playing a game or doing the double-tap gesture to show notifications when it's locked. I suppose I could see this shaking something loose over a long period of time or something, but that feels like a flimsy excuse.  The other thing only applies to the 5a– I bought some NFC tags and played around with some NFC and automation apps. Everything was from the Play Store if I recall, but they required pretty liberal permissions to use how I wanted. I'm no hardcore developer or anything, but I generally knew what I was doing. I was using resources and instructions from trustworthy places. I did some neat stuff with my smart lighting and saved a lot of time automating work things. There never seemed to be any directly observable issues.   After my 5a bricked so suddenly, I thought I'd be cautious by staying away from anything too far out of the box, and never used those apps or things in that realm on the 7 Pro. I doubt it was a problem in the first place, but again, I'm no h4x0r and I might've been a bit out of my depth.I still owe $480 on this 7 Pro that is currently unresponsive, and I can't help but notice that iPhone users don't seem to have this kind of consistent trouble. It's not even like the price difference is that stark anymore.Fool me once, etc"

Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and I'm not a pro reviewer or anything.Firstly, wow these are so small and light!  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big.  They are really comfy to wear too. Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2.117 for buds and 1.55 for case.The sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s.  I haven't played with the EQ and probably won't to be honest, because songs are recorded at so many different levels you'll be constantly fiddling with it, so I just leave it as is.  I'm also over fifty now so my hearing isn't top notch!The noise cancelling is excellent, and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far. All of it feels really nicely made, the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is like.Now for the problems.Now this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned, but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far.  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially, but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit.  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering, my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding.  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phone.Then when I put my hood up and starting jogging back, the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off.  Very annoying! Especially in the rain with a dog.Anyway, once this happened it was like the earphones crashed.  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again.  So I don't know if this is a software glitch or not, but I'm not going back out into the rain too test then again!Another thing is knowing where to tap them.  You can't see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance, you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track.  I'm going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment.  Airpods just work so much better in this regard.Anyway, these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours.  Perhaps after some use I'll get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them.  I hope so because they're lovely and sound and cancelling are great.EDIT: Forgot to mention, the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for it.EDIT2: multi-point connection works really really well for me.EDIT3: after saying all that about the multi point, it's stopped working!  Nothing will play on my Pixel now.  I had to put the buds back in the box, shut down all my media apps, shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work.  Poor!  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future. Sigh ..."

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

I, for one, learned the hard way and this is my experience... These devices are riddled with bugs, glitches, manufacturer flaws and a slew of other downright annoying ""features."" Google Customer Support is all but useless. If you have anything currently in ""escalation,"" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their ""certified repair partner"" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a ""certified"" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a ""Manager,"" ""Supervisor,"" or member of the ""Escalation Team"" in 24-48 hours? Rest assured, you will NOT be contacted. And if by some miracle you are contacted, the person likely won't speak in your native tongue, AND will likely have more questions than answers! I was in awe: ""Excuse me? You called me back a month later as a member of the Escalation Team and YOU are asking ME what seems to be the problem?!?"" Honestly, it's like you're talking to the first line of defense all over again...Only to be forwarded and transferred all over the place to be asked the same questions a dozen more times. As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the ""extended warranties"" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly. But a simple Google search (I know, Google, right?!?) will flood you with warranty info, defect issues and a plethora of horror stories similar to mine. Do not get lost in the shiney new toy. Stick with what you know.It really should have never gotten to this point, as any reputable company would have just fixed the phone or, hell, even replaced the damn thing! And for those of you with screen defects, it doesn't simply get better with a ""repair."" A coworker of mine had their Pixel screen replaced THREE times only to have the problem persist within weeks if not days. Replacing a faulty display with a faulty display doesn't help too much.

I've primarily used Chinese phones (Xiaomi, Oppo) and haven't experienced hardware issues with any of the 3 phones I've owned over the past 10 years.I updated phones due to receiving new ones as gifts or rewards in competitions, or when software support ended.My current phone is an Oppo A52, which I bought in 2020 at a very low price. I put a cheap case on it and have dropped it frequently. I even use the phone under light / heavy rain although the phone is not water resistant.

However, I've noticed on Reddit and elsewhere online that the Pixel series seems to have reliability issues, with reports of green lines on the screen or connectivity problems. I'm puzzled by how such an expensive phone, costing twice as much as my current Oppo, could be so unreliable. Are people's expectations too high?For context, I rarely use my phone, mostly for authenticator apps and calling.

I'm comfortable with wireless sideloading.Things I won't do:- I'm not a runner, I might take it cycling once in a while or for a swim but I cannot run for longer than 3km.- I won't disclose where I ordered the watch. I don't want them to get into trouble.- I won't reveil my serial number or IMEI.- I will not spend hours to get to the bottom of your questions, I have two kids running around that I prioritise above everything else.- I won't do anything illegal, obviously.So yeah, my first comment will probably be of the contents of the package. I'm excited, hopefully I can be helpful."

In those threads, unfortunately, there weren't updates after the OP's first post. From what I could tell, folks eventually gave up and got rid of their phones.Curious as to whether anyone was able to ""resolve"" these issues by flashing their modem back to A13 while remaining on A15, or performing a factory reset altogether and staying on 13?I'm at my wits end!

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

negative,"[' Audio, Technical, Video, User Experience']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any.

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."

[Which still isn't as good as the 8 Pro, but is at least in the same ballpark. ](https://imgur.com/8FLlZbo)The same processing error can be seen in a fully zoomed shot across a room looking at the closeup of a model kit box. [The 8 Pro produces](https://imgur.com/mC1atBs) a very clean image. [The 9 Pro taken](https://imgur.com/0pssZiq) from the same spot produces an incredibly noisy, messy blobby image. The [YouTuber InDepth Tech Reviews](https://youtu.be/ah6LMIvf5SQ) has also noticed this same behaviour from the 9 Pro. Hopefully this is something that can be drawn to Google's attention and corrected with software, as it seems to be a software issue causing it. But i'm pretty bummed that even at its current best the 9 Pro isn't as good at night zoom as the 8 Pro, which is weird because in daylight zoom photography I've noticed the 9 Pro to be the better one.

I have 8 days left to trade the phone back ... Would love some reassurance from longer-term pixel users. I will say some stuff I love so far is + Design, the Hazel is stellar + Google makes everything ""easy"", it's well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over + Google ecosystem works great for productivity + Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer+ Customization but won't get into it as everyone knows this already + Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly, while apple recently has been trending opposite.+ Cost to package ratio. Some stuff I'm having anxiety about - accessories are what I miss most about apple... Really liked my Apple watch and airpods. I have pixel buds now and they just don't hit how I hoped - unfortunately I'm one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit, FB, YouTube and instagram, makes me feel like the phone is less ""premium"". On android 15- Google photos just isn't as seamless as iCloud photos imo, it syncs inconsistently for me- switching between cameras is VERY choppy - app performance, I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple, the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable, whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you don't feel much of a difference "

And I keep the screen always at lower brightness than I would like.- Overheating: It's true that we are experiencing hotter summer than ever, but when outside the camera app makes it overheat SO quickly. I've had the device turning off for overheat while I was taking a video(and I was inside a house)...now I just ""let it rest"" for a few minutes when I feel it is overheating.- Modem: always been crappy, especially for people travelling in different regions of the world, the pixel is not the device to own. Happy that they've given up and the Pixel 9 modem will be Samsung made.- Software-based locked/removed features just to make the Pixel 8 Pro more enticing (as if the Pixel 8 is a cheap entry model ).I don't know how to evaluate new devices anymore, every time a new device comes out it seems like the perfect device with incredible reviews, but the reality is that I had a better experience on my Pixel 5."

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical']","My experience with Pixel 9 Pro XL +I've been using the Pixel 9 Pro XL since October, and here are some of my observations, experiences, and disappointments. I was previously an iPhone user (from the iPhone 8 Plus to the 14 Pro Max), but before my first iPhone, I had a Galaxy Note 5, so I know how using an Android phone is. I returned to Android with the Pixel 9 Pro because of its advertised AI features, and because I wanted more customization options.  It's been a bit jarring to realize that Android still isn't as smooth and polished as iOS.While Android offers many software features I love, such as Gemini, instant Google search, and text selection from the home bar—things I wish Apple would integrate—the app optimization is baffling!  Apps often look better and function more smoothly on iOS. For example, WhatsApp's UI is far superior on Apple, and the scrolling through apps and web pages are smooth like butter on iOS compared to Android.Another frustration is third-party launchers. I expected them to work seamlessly, but the phone glitches every time I try to return to the home screen. The default Pixel Launcher works perfectly, but I really want to customize my home screen without these annoyances!And to add to the list of my frustrations, I find Google photos to be lacking a lot in terms of navigation through media compared to iOS.I know, I could just ditch this phone and go back to an iPhone, but I won't. I am in the looks for solutions since I'll be stuck with this phone for years and I like to tinker around.Any way, that's my rant.

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6.   Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. /rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."

Here are my observations so far+I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","The things I like about Android+Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up. (Now if only we could adopt longer battery life to smart watches ::cough:: pixel watch ::cough::)Edit 4 - ended my day of normal-high usage at 25%. Woke up with it at 6:45 AM and laying down in bed with it now at 11:30 PM. ## Performance I don't really game much on my phone but it played Pokemon Go very easily.## Gemini vs Google Assistant? It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. 😂The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro. New phone has me with new lingo already Edit 5 - reworded the Gemini and Google Assistant section to make more sense. "
negative,"[' Audio, Bluetooth, WiFi, Experience, User, Technical, Voice Quality']","FWIW - thoughts on my ""forced"" 8 Pro -> 9 Pro upgrade+I’ve been upgrading every cycle since the G1 (first Android phone). Over the years, I’ve tried some non-Google phones (Samsung and HTC), but I’ve always stuck with stock Android. I was perfectly happy with my Pixel 8 Pro—no complaints. It felt like an incremental improvement over the 7 Pro.But… my son, who got my 7 Pro (and loved it), accidentally cracked it. So, I was “forced” into the upgrade shuffle earlier than planned. So here’s what stands out:**What I Like:*** **Size**: The 9 Pro is slightly smaller than the 8 Pro, which feels just right (closer to the 4a—which I LOVED).*  **Battery**: Massive improvement—noticeably better (like 50%!). Same apps, no behavior changes.* **Wireless Charging**: My Tesla Model Y’s wireless pad barely kept the 8 Pro topped off. The 9 Pro hits 100% quickly.* **Modem**: Better data speeds and more consistent call quality. **What's ok:*** **The Camera:** Mixed bag—better in some scenarios, worse in others. * **Finger print reader:** Seems to be the same as the 8 Pro.Overall, I didn’t *want* to upgrade, but the 9 Pro feels like a solid step up in the areas that matter to me.Of course, YMMV."

Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https://imgur.com/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https://i.imgur.com/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https://i.imgur.com/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https://i.imgur.com/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https://i.imgur.com/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https://i.imgur.com/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https://i.imgur.com/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my ""Google"" folder is [even bigger](https://i.imgur.com/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https://i.imgur.com/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a £1400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."

I use them to control Home devices, I use them to add items to my grocery list on Keep, I occasionally use it to open apps, and I use it to create reminders, check my Calendar, and create Calendar events. I don't have conversations with it, as a rule.I got my Pixel 9 yesterday. Hardware-wise: lovely, solid little phone (literally: it's smaller, and I'm thrilled about that). Zippy, bright screen, lightning-fast fingerprint sensor, great camera. Overall I'm pleased, as an every-three-years updater.I turned on Gemini,  briefly, to see if it had improved.It... mostly hasn't.Of the things I listed above, the only thing it does reliably is turn lights on and off. Everything else? It flat-out refused to create a Calendar event (said it 'couldn't do that yet'), could not see items on my calendar that I could see with my own eyes in the app (like when my next dentist appointment was), and though it can add things to Keep, it does it by creating a brand-new list with the same name as the one I told it to add the item to (a brand-new list I then *cannot see* in Keep), unless the request is phrased very, very carefully. It took three tries.Maybe it's just because I'm in Canada? Canadians only get one voice in Gemini, at least according to the bot itself. I haven't yet been able to find confirmation of which features are and aren't available here, and it would be par for the bloody course that select, invisible features of this fancy new LLM simply aren't there for us (I've seen US users saying the Calendar stuff, at least, was working for them as far back as February). But boy, is this frustrating. Switching back to Assistant for now (again).ETA: Despite helpful advice (switching all the languages in the system and Google to US English), this still isn't working. I get ""Sorry, I can't help with that. You can create calendar events by using the Google Calendar App."" And now I'm fed up with poking at it, so I'm sticking with Assistant for the time being, which already does all the stuff I want it to do. Thanks to everyone anyway!ETA2: I did eventually get Create Calendar Event working, by uninstalling/disabling Gemini, turning off activity and extensions at the account level in browser, and starting from scratch with *only* the language in Gemini set to US English (changing device language to US English broke it again), then enabling the Workspace extension only when prompted. I documented my testing, I repeated the steps, and if I did any of that after the fact, or in a different order, it failed. Officially too much trouble as an end user, and at the moment, not worth it to me, as it still can't do better than half the other basic tasks I currently use Assistant for. (If you enjoy having conversations with your phone, and all the summarizing and email-writing stuff, more power to you. That's not what I need or want a voice assistant to do. I want it as an interface into my phone's operating system.)I also feel pretty strongly that a flagship product shouldn't require me to jump through so many hoops to get it to perform a basic, advertised function. E.g., if it's supposed to be available in my region, I shouldn't have to change languages to get it to work.(And it still can't tell me when my next dentist appointment is. 😂)Going back to Assistant. Maybe I'll try Gemini again in a few months."

When I try to trade in the Google pixel 7 Pro it's only offering £215 which is absolutely ridiculous because for the same phone when I bought my Google pixel 9 Pro fold it gave me £700. What's going on here?And I checked to see how much is offering if I go for a flagship it's offering the same amount of money or if you go for the fold it gives you a little bit more. It's a good thing I bought my fold when I did because now the pixel 7 Pro is worth nothing..I actually bought a Google pixel 7 Pro from eBay for £200 and traded it in for £700. So I made a £500 saving on the Pixel 9 Pro fold.That's why on eBay in the UK pixel 7 pros were selling between £150 to £200. But when people found out that this was happening where people were purchasing pixel 7 pros on eBay and trading them in for £700.

negative,[' Video Issues: display'],"Pixel 9 series colors are washed out?+I’ve noticed that the color reproduction on my Pixel 9 Pro XL is significantly lacking vibrancy, making the display appear dull and flat. I also reviewed my friends' Pixel 9/9 pros. The colors seem washed out, and the screen lacks natural real life saturation. When compared to an iPhone, a Galaxy device, pixel 7 or even a professional monitor, the display looks almost lifeless.I understand that Pixel displays are often described as more ""natural,"" but I'm also comparing it to real-life colors, like those in a park, and the difference is still glaring. The problem is so noticeable that photos taken on the Pixel look far better when viewed on a monitor. Additionally, white on the screen often have a yellowish tint, which further detracts from the overall experience. I’ve already tried adjusting both the “Natural” and “Adaptive” color settings, but neither seems to resolve the issue.What’s strange is that when I’m outdoors, where auto-brightness kicks in, or when I manually set the brightness above 80%, the colors seem to improve. It’s almost as if the device recalibrates itself under these conditions. However, at lower brightness levels, the color reproduction becomes muted and off, making the display feel less vibrant and accurate.I strongly believe Google should implement a simple, user-adjustable setting for color calibration, similar to what’s available on iPhones or Galaxy devices. Alternatively, I would love to see the return of the ""Boosted"" mode that was previously available.As a partial workaround, I’ve found that adjusting the color correction settings in Accessibility (by selecting the ""Blue-Yellow"" or ""Red-Green"" filters and setting the intensity to 0 on the left) it improves the color quality. Interestingly, when this is done, a ""Picture Color Mode: Use sRGB"" option appears in the developer options, removing the ""Adaptive/natural Color"" in the settings. If you turn off the color correction, this mode disappears from the developer options.This adjustment is a bit clunky, but it shows that there is potential for improvement in color reproduction accuracy and vibrancy. It would be great if Google could introduce a more intuitive solution."

But the software seems a bit limiting. I want to invest in getting good time lapse and night sky time lapse. For this I need to get long duration time lapse video. I understand that changing the frame rate changes the time duration but the videos seem to cut off too soon. For a sunrise it shuts off before the sun comes up! Damn that is anoying.Is there a way to turn on the time lapse and have it run until turned off (or battery runs low). Alternatively set the ToD to shut off or number of frames or something that affects the ToD it shut down?Maybe there is a better app for time lapse that allows full scheduling? I have a very long usb and can run the phone from a power supply all day/night if needed.

I was looking into Pixels but they've been out of my price range at the time.Fast forward a few years, I've gotten myself a job and I'm looking for a company phone, which I've ""settled"" with a Pixel 7 Pro, as the non-pro was out of stock and work would cover the price difference. Great. I got the phone and immediately changed my perspective on high-end Android phones, and Pixels as a whole. It's genuinely the best phone I've owned up until that point. My only complaints were the software bugs that took forever to fix, weak haptics (coming from an iPhone), large size and the curved display, which I've never been a fan of. Looking for a personal phone, I've set my eyes on the Pixel 9 series when the leaks about a smaller ""Pro"" model came out. When it actually came out, I was quite frankly disappointed. AI slop all over the marketing, no Qi2, a very ambitious price hike, and stingy launch promo compared to the past. But I was in the need of a new purely personal phone, and with the reviews praising the battery life front and back, I decided to still take the shot, luckily having saved up for how much I expected the 256GB model to cost.  Week 1, I loved it. Got a solid 9-10h of screen-on time with my normal use, and it was my first time ever going to sleep with the intention to charge the phone the next day. Mind-blowing. There were  a few minor issues which got solved with the first software update, but otherwise, it's genuinely the best phone I've ever owned, yet again. I did however, encounter an issue with RCS, that took TWO MONTHS to fix - my carrier providing all the info I'd ever need to resolve it with Google, but Google then just stonewalled me and told me to do what the previous rep told me to, despite the very previous email being a response to that.   The issue was never resolved. After about a month of use, the battery life just kept getting weaker and weaker, with the battery lasting ""only"" for the whole day, hitting 10% when I was heading to sleep, with only 4h of screen-on time. That's considerably worse than what I got on the Pixel 7 Pro. What the hell??   There was also the Android 15 update, which only introduced the same annoying bugs that wouldn't get fixed for two updates that I had with the Pixel 7, which is unacceptable when you're paying 1100€+ for a smartphone. Quoting a colleague, ""if it doesn't give you head for that price, it's a waste of money"". Next up is the camera. What happened to the zoom quality?? I took a picture of a car in the Ikea parking lot at 10x, and the asphalt looked sharper than the car itself - if you zoomed in, it looked like some AI-generated asphalt texture that's just a repeating texture with the wrong perspective. On top of the fact that this phone tends to oversaturate EVERYTHING. And let's not get started with how awful the stabilization is in any situation where you're not still. I expect better. On the bright side - for the battery issues, I've sent the phone in for repair, and the RMA was accepted. I'm suspecting it's a bad modem - it's my only explanation for how it could be this bad with daily use. Props to Google for actually taking it in instead of stonewalling me again, but having these issues on a 1000€+ smartphone is again, unacceptable. I do hope not many people are having issues with them. For a phone that's 1) gotten a considerable price hike this year 2) no longer has good value deals and 3) has the exact same kinds of issues as my now two-generations-behind Pixel 7 Pro, it's just way too overpriced. Even the Black Friday deals absolutely sucked for my region, 50€ off a 1100€ 128GB base model? Seriously??All of the issues combined with the price hike and the sour experience with Google overall these past few months, caused me to decide to sell my Pixel 9 and get an iPhone instead. I'm done with Pixels for personal use, and genuinely cannot in my right mind recommend anyone to get a Pixel - even if it's like me and it's for ""3-4 years"". The price just plain isn't worth it for what the phone offers.Hopefully Google gets their shit together by the next time I'm buying a phone for work. Tldr;The Pixel 9 Pro is great, but I can't recommend it in any right mind. Too many issues for a too high of a cost. "

But worse off, I can't communicate to anyone for phone calls.  Let me back up to Ok Google: I can say ""Ok Google"" (and its only setup to respond during android auto) and it will react, but then it just sits there waiting... very patiently.  Could wait 3 minutes before it gives up.  No matter what I say, it never seems to respond.I know with my headset (Sony WF-1000XM4), I can still do tap and command things, so I'm at a loss here.I also remember that there was one other time it basically did this which I believe it was October and was fixed with a specific Android Auto update combined with an android update and I had the Pixel 7 Pro then.  So I'm hoping its the same way here.I've read so many things from here to other subreddits that it almost sounds like its just specifically an Android 15 issue, but I know at one point, if I got rid of the connection to the car on Bluetooth and removed the car's info about the phone, then re-added it, it would work for calls, but I still couldn't use Google Assistant for making calls or messages.Looks like I saw something about Android 16 may have the real fix, but its still in beta.

There was no debris in there or anything it just would stop working. Flat line on voice record. Happened enough that I’ve put it in to get checked through the store. I babied the phone, never dropped, never wet. Not left in lint filled pocket or anything. I even placed it down on soft surfaces only. I did all the normal checks and it wasn’t turned off or anything. Even factory reset and it still had the issue about once a day or every two days.

negative,"[' Audio, Technical, Video, User Experience']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6.   Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting my screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly. You have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on/off the device.** This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega/giga bytes consumed per day.** I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.** This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: *Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app?* I sometimes get several notifications from Duolingo, but they are always split.

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown: \*\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app) # 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on. # 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files # 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers. # 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet. # 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!) # 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons. # 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows. # 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\*\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

I tried going back to the iPhone and for the most part, it’s been fine but some of the iPhone quirks that made me take Android for granted are just too much. I can’t deal with not having a universal back gesture, the iPhone keyboard is hot garbage, I don’t like Safari one bit, the settings menu is a cluttered mess, and I miss having Call Screen and some of the Pixel features. 8A here I come."
negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Technical, Others, Support']","Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far+I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."

I recently bought 8a. I love the phone.. But some..small things here and there triggers me.. when i tried to see who called yesterday and at what time?... That information was not available. Later I found out that it can be accessed through the 3dots -> call history and then see the time of call..This is stupid..why can't it just show the time people called in call logs? Is there any option to bring the call history or date and time of call to display in call logs?.. Thanks!

Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https://imgur.com/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https://i.imgur.com/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https://i.imgur.com/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https://i.imgur.com/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https://i.imgur.com/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https://i.imgur.com/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https://i.imgur.com/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my ""Google"" folder is [even bigger](https://i.imgur.com/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https://i.imgur.com/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a £1400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."

Love the case, feels super solid and it's MagSafe compatible so I've purchased a Qi2 MagSafe car charger.Unfortunately, I am getting charging speeds of around 2-3W max with the case on. This makes the charger unusable since I often use maps on long drives in the car. I've since learned that the 9 Pro doesn't support Qi2 but it does support Qi EPP (up to 12W) which would be fine and the spec is supposed to be backwards compatible.

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Things People Complain About Are Pointless+It bugs me sometimes that the people who complain about certain aspects of the Pixel line are looking at this product from a lens of someone below the age of 18. This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13"" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it ""exciting""? Not really. But its out of my way and out of my mind, it just works, and if it doesn't, I don't notice it."

I consider myself a power user and a shutter bug, so I need a phone with welly and a decent camera. I do a lot of tinkering with Tasker and Termux and have these burning away in the background.I came from the Pixel 3a, to Pixel 5 and now the Pixel 8 Pro. I also rock a Samsung S20 5G, which coupled the weak CPU in the Pixel 5. I now have a single device to tinker on.Camera is almost flawless. I mean, no camera is perfect, but so far it's definitely the best camera on a phone I've had my hands on (admittedly, I avoid Apple). Photos and videos are of outstanding, professional quality and that's before editing it.Battery is flipping awesome. From the overuse of my P5 and S20, their batteries are not holding up as much, so charging became commonplace. I still use the S20 for some things and each time I go to put it on charge, the Pixel 8P still has over 70% left (after 12 or more hours). Have played CoD and Metalstorm a lot (at high res and 60fps), even over 5G and the battery still holds it's own. Device does get warm, I'd be rather worried if it didn't with what it was doing!UI/UX. Well, it's classic Android as always. Under the hood Google have added some cool AI features and gestures. Double tap to back takes some fiddling over the P5, but I am wearing a shock case on the P8P. I had to turn off the animations, mind (Developer Menu or via Accessibility). They were too smooth/slow for my liking, I prefer a snappy UI. I have switched to using Nova (8.x) as my launcher and use 3 button navigation (am an old timer, so shhh! 😂).Biometrics. Well, I don't know what it wrong with everyone else, but I even have a hardened glass on my P8P and have had an easy 98/100 success rate. I do prefer either back or side mounted, but the under screen does come in useful when you can't pick up phone. Fortunately, the S20 has screen fingerprint, so had time to get used to one. Oh and it has face unlock, which seems to know when you're using a photo instead of a person. This creeped me out with one of my banking apps. Opened it, looked away as it loaded, looked back to see my balances 😖. If you have a Pixel watch, you can even unlock your phone from watch.Network. I use two SIMs (eSIM+SIM) on this. One is very 5G available and the other is mostly used for calls and texts, as well as backup data. The phone is mostly on cell, 5G being very common. The other network does have 5G, but only in some areas (EE UK and Vodafone UK). I did this with my Pixel 5 as well as my S20 (have at least two different networks, giving me access to all 4 MNO's in the UK (Three, O2, EE, Vodafone)). Despite what I've read of others, I don't experience overheating or excessive battery drain. I will admit, the phone did not like one of my WiFi 5 WPA3 only access points. Just outright refuses to connect to it. Every other AP and it's fine. Speed of both 4G/5G and WiFi 5 are as expected. Haven't tested a 6/6e AP, yet.Power user friendliness. It's a frigging beast! I've thrown all kinds of shenanigans at it. Compiled a few wheels in Termux for python, as well as some ham radio tools and onboard AI and it storms through. Tasker is doing a variety of things based on conditions and events, including reactions to the logcat. With 9 cores and 12GB RAM, it has welly to go wading all day long. Neither have been terminated in background and phantom processes aren't killed. I used my S20 for most of this, as it has 12GB RAM, too. Now it's all being offloaded to the Pixel as it's just outright faster. Still waiting to test out UWB, too.Questions? Please do ask. "

Can I still accomplish these things without root?+My current device is a Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is bootloader locked until I've been with my carrier for 60 days, after which I can unlock and run a custom ROM or root or whatever. In the meantime, I've been rethinking my reasons for rooting in the first place.I've been rooting my phones - mostly Pixel devices - for the better part of a decade. I have my reasons and, in the past, they were pretty valid since there was no workaround for most of them. Now, though, I feel like I might be able to get away without root. Note: I don't use banking apps or Wallet or anything else with my phone that looks for root, so that's never been a problem.##Ad-blocking without a VPN##I sometimes need to use a VPN and so relying on ad-blocking via the VPN route is a non-starter. I have become aware of the ""Private DNS"" setting that's been available for the past couple of versions of Android (which I missed because I was always using AdAway, anyway). Will using something like *dns.adguard-dns.com* accomplish the same as AdAway?##Unlimited Google Photos upload##The ethics of it are irrelevant; I want to continue spoofing my phone so I can get unlimited, full-quality uploads to Google Photos. In the past, I have used the [Pixelify sub-module](https://www.pling.com/p/2004615/) and while it's not perfect (the app pesters me to update all the time), it does the job. It does appear that there's [ReVanced GPhotos](https://github.com/Unofficial-Life/revanced-gphotos-build) that doesn't require root and just relies on [GmsCore](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore).##Automatic call recording##This seems to be a big one due to the difference in laws by state, country, region, whatever. Where I live, however, does not require two-party consent for those in the same state and so I very much want to enable automatic call recording for numbers not in my contacts list. It's up to me to inform the other person if they're in another state. Anyway, I have used Pixelify for this in the past, though it's caused issues at times and so have also used [Basic Call Recorder (BCR)](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR). I'm not aware of *any* non-root alternative, so I feel like this is going to be a big hurdle for moving away from root.Any and all suggestions are welcome and appreciated!"

It will appear in the Recents tab with a tap letting you view the full transcript and listen to the audio. This is powered by on-device Gemini Nano.I still have a few questions about it : 1.

I was checking the live feed of my camera and someone arrived and pressed the door. I answered it almost immediately and ran downstair to open the door. When I was downstair the driver was already on his way walking back to his car. I called him and he went back to me. He handed over a brown A4 size envelope with bubles inside. I wasn't sure what was it, but he didn't have anything else with him. It was before he suddenly said ""I actually have another parcel for you. It's in the car, just wait here for a moment."" That must have been the watch I thought. The driver went to his car and I followed him to the main street where I could see where he parked.

He might honestly forget about my other parcel (the watch) but then again he didn't seem apologetic and the fact that he suddenly 'remembered' he had another parcel for me in his car was very suspicious.Not sure if I should report this to the courier company.

I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that ""120Hz smoothness"" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8's UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the ""Pro"" models. In conclusion, if you were concerned with the stuttering, I am happy to report, there is no issue with it. I only tried one unit so far, but it was much, much better than Pixel 8."

I feel like i would enjoy the 9 Pro more in the beginning but im not sure if its just the craving for something new and a current mood that will fade away shortly after the honeymoon phase. Could go the other way as well with the flat sides making the 9 XL feel even bigger and with me already feeling like the 8 Pro is too big atm. The XL only being 40€ more expensive after calculating in the bigger discount on the watch + more cashback really makes this even harder. Faster charging sadly isnt a concern for me whatsoever so i cant argue with that to make the decision any easier.

However, I miss all the rest my Pixel has, like:\- Notifications control, like sending to Watch Later directly from the YouTube notification, and how Android treats notifications in all. \- Keyboard GBoard\- AI features\- Back Gesture\- Camara is better, at least color rendering. I´m going back and forth on my decision if keeping the iPhone (which also means Airpods and Watch), or keeping my old love with Pixel and going for the 9 Pro. "

I really enjoy just LTE. I noticed my phone lasted almost 24 hours without charging which blew my mind. Also it's more consistent with data reliability than spotty 5G.Is anyone else having this issue?

Was going to go Pixel 9 Pro, but is it still having these overheating issues???I was really excited about trying my first Pixel phone. On a/smartphones I made a post a few days ago where the consensus was that I should get the Pixel 9 Pro for my next device. But I just came across a post here from 4 months ago where a fair amount of people were talking about all the overheating issues they’ve experienced with their Pixel 9’s, as well as a lot of Pixel’s previous lines. As someone who doesn’t know much about Pixels, or really even smartphones in general, is this really a big issue with the latest Pixels? Is it something that can/was fixed in a software update? Or is this just unfortunately inherent to Pixels, and I should look for a different phone?I live down in South MS where it is quite hot for most of the year, and upgrading to a phone that has heating issues doesn’t sound like the smartest idea.Oh and how could I forget. When I was actually in the AT&T store yesterday to officially make the swap to Pixel 9, the store employee said “Now I just want to let you know, a customer just returned their Pixel 9 because it blew up in their car after their toddler had been messing with it”. Obviously I don’t know all the details of that story, but holy shit. I have 3 nephews under 6. I can’t risk anything like that happening to them.Is this really as big of a deal as I’m making it out to be? Or are there always a couple outliers who unfortunately end up with a crappy product?"

I was so excited that I was tracking my package on the app for 2 hours to see where the driver is moving and when he is arriving at my home. I could see the driver was at a nearby apartment for almost an hour and I assume the live tracking was not being updated. Luckily I had my window blinds open so I can see the driveway from my home if the FedEx driver passes my home. I saw a FedEx truck passed my home and the notification suddenly changed to ""Delivered"" even though the truck did not stop at my home and no one ever knocked at my door. I rushed outside  without footwear to catch the driver but he was quick and left. While I was outside thinking I lost my package, I saw the package lying outside my neighbors garage door and another car waiting right in front of my garage . I live in an apartment and the garages are along the driveway and anyone could've picked the package if I was 5 seconds late. The car which was there left as soon as he saw me. I believe he and the FedEx driver were in it together. The driver posted the picture of the package next to the garage door as a proof of delivery. My house door is just 5 steps away from the garage and the driver could've placed the package in front of my door but he put it in the driveway deliberately. I'm relieved since I got my package but this is so unprofessional on FedEx and Google's part as I clearly check the option of ""Signature Required"" which was ignored by FedEx."

I work in an extremely loud and chaotic workplace, and the only way I can get my buds to read my messages is if I verbally talk and ask ""read my messages;"" again, I work in an environment where talking to my buds is simply not possible.Beyond ear buds, there is a disturbing ethos permeating Google... Anything useful, helpful, or enjoyable to its users is being removed. I was heartbroken when they killed Google Podcasts and have yet to find an app as good as it. Now, with this shitty update that killed the only feature I actually use all the time, I have no desire to purchase the next iteration of the Google Buds Pro...

Here are possible solutions for each category:\n\n1. Audio Issues: Check your phone's audio settings to ensure that text notifications and SMS sounds are enabled. Also, consider restarting your phone or performing a factory reset if necessary.\n2. User Experience: Since the problem occurs with specific iPhone users, try updating your messaging app (if you use a third-party app) or reinstalling it. Additionally, ensure that your contacts' phone numbers are saved correctly in your device.\n3. Service: Contact Verizon's customer support to discuss the issue and explore potential solutions. They may be able to provide further troubleshooting steps or recommend upgrades to your service plan.\n4. Support: Explain the problem to Verizon's support team, providing details about when it occurs and any relevant messages or log data if available. Ask them to help you diagnose the issue and offer solutions.\n5. Others: Consider adding a third-party SMS app as an alternative for sending/receiving messages on your Pixel 7. If the problem persists, you may want to switch carriers or get a new phone as a last resort.\n6. Technical: Work with Verizon's technical support to investigate whether there are network-related issues causing the problem. They may be able to recommend steps to improve signal strength and stability.\n7. Call drop: Although this category seems unrelated, it could be possible that network instability related to voice calls is affecting SMS functionality. If call quality is also an issue, address this with Verizon's technical support as well.\n8. Bluetooth: Ensure that your phone's Bluetooth settings are correct and that any connected devices are functioning properly. Sometimes Bluetooth interference can impact text message delivery.\n9. WiFi: If you frequently use Wi-Fi for SMS, ensure that your Wi-Fi connection is stable and fast enough to support messaging.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you’re in a country that has one!"

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown: \*\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app) # 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on. # 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files # 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers. # 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet. # 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!) # 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons. # 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows. # 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\*\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience+Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far+I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Service, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","The things I like about Android+Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."

It was great for the first couple weeks. I've enjoyed the battery life and camera quality on the phone. But starting a few weeks ago, I noticed that I was missing calls and texts. I'd be at work with my phone sitting next to me all day with no notifications. Next time I turn my screen on, I get hit with multiple notifications, including texts, sometimes hours late. My wife says calls sometimes go straight to voicemail, meaning she literally cannot reach me in the event of an emergency. And when I can receive calls, the call quality is sometimes so bad that I can barely understand what she's saying.I've done some searching on Reddit and elsewhere and it seems I'm not alone. For every proposed solution, there's a dozen people immediately replying that it doesn't work, which leaves me rather hopeless.On top of that, the Pixel Watch's crown broke off with in the first month. No idea what happened. Just looked down one day and noticed it was gone. Thankfully I was able to get a replacement under warranty pretty quickly, but the warranty process was rather frustrating. When I tried explain that the crown broke off but the screen still works fine, the customer service rep straight up did not comprehend why I wanted a replacement. If it ""works fine"" why do you need a new one? Ugh. The battery life is terrible, barely lasting a day even with battery saver on.I don't know what to do. I really don't want to ditch the phone so soon after I bought it, but I also can't just be totally unreachable 8 hours a day. If it's truly a Doze problem as the internet suggests, switching to another Android phone seems futile. I don't really want to switch to iPhone, but honestly it seems like the best solution.What are y'all's thoughts?EDIT: Adding some links for reference:[Why am I missing calls???!

Thanks all for your advice etc, it's calmed down a little now heat wise, and I do think this silly round boy will grow on me :)My Pixel 6 screen broke recently after three years of heavy use. I didn't want to spend £799 on the 9 when hardware updates seemed incremental, so I bought a new 8 for fairly cheap last week.All the UI bugs are still there. The phone gets warm really quick, from relatively minimal use. Charging speeds are _a snail's pace_ unless I turn the phone fully off (I'm assuming thermal throttling).This is my second Pixel 8, after buying one used and having the same experience. I assumed that was just its previous use, but all the issues are still present with the brand new one.It's mostly the heat problem that concerns me the most. It's literally always warm, even when typing this post. Is this a common issue for others also?"
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, WiFi']","FWIW - thoughts on my ""forced"" 8 Pro -> 9 Pro upgrade+I’ve been upgrading every cycle since the G1 (first Android phone). Over the years, I’ve tried some non-Google phones (Samsung and HTC), but I’ve always stuck with stock Android. I was perfectly happy with my Pixel 8 Pro—no complaints. It felt like an incremental improvement over the 7 Pro.But… my son, who got my 7 Pro (and loved it), accidentally cracked it. So, I was “forced” into the upgrade shuffle earlier than planned. So here’s what stands out:**What I Like:*** **Size**: The 9 Pro is slightly smaller than the 8 Pro, which feels just right (closer to the 4a—which I LOVED).*  **Battery**: Massive improvement—noticeably better (like 50%!). Same apps, no behavior changes.* **Wireless Charging**: My Tesla Model Y’s wireless pad barely kept the 8 Pro topped off. The 9 Pro hits 100% quickly.* **Modem**: Better data speeds and more consistent call quality. **What's ok:*** **The Camera:** Mixed bag—better in some scenarios, worse in others. * **Finger print reader:** Seems to be the same as the 8 Pro.Overall, I didn’t *want* to upgrade, but the 9 Pro feels like a solid step up in the areas that matter to me.Of course, YMMV."

Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https://imgur.com/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https://i.imgur.com/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https://i.imgur.com/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https://i.imgur.com/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https://i.imgur.com/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https://i.imgur.com/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https://i.imgur.com/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my ""Google"" folder is [even bigger](https://i.imgur.com/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https://i.imgur.com/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a £1400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."
negative,"[' User Experience: user, experience, technical, tech']","Pixel 9 Pro incompatible with Pixel Stand 2?+\[UPDATE\]  This may be due to the magsafe case I am using.  While I had tested without it and saw the power draw go negative it doesn't disconnect and eventually peaks out at over 3000 mAmps.  Now I believe it might be an issue with magsafe cases.  From what I've seen the cases all put the ring with the google logo in the middle.  However to be aligned it should actually be lower.  I'm going to try a few other cases and maybe try a sticker of my own to see if I can resolve\[END UPDATE\]    Buyer beware the pixel 9 pro does not appear to be compatible with the Pixel Stand 2 despite advertising saying it should charge at 21W.  I know it was announced this was true for the fold but not for other Pixel 9s.Behavior:When you set the phone on the charger it starts charging at 400-600 mAmps.  You can verify this using the app named ""ampere"".  As it sits it starts climbing up until the Pixel Stand 2 blinks amber quickly.  At that point the charging disconnects goes negative for a few seconds until it reconnects and starts at 400 mAmps again.  I've tried with and without a case and neither of them helps.  I'm using the Pixel Stand 2 with the charging block and cable that were shipped with the stand.   My wifes generic branded wireless charging works just fine at about 800-900 mAmps.   This is really unfortunate.I've tried changing the stand settings from optimized to quiet but that doesn't help.  My Pixel 6 charges just fine.  Perhaps this is why the Pixel Stand 2 has been discontinued.Anyone else experiencing this issue?"

I did a one week review to give my initial perspective on the switch and I was not too convinced of the switch back then.  It has been 3 months since the Google Pixel P9XL was launched and I was fortunate enough to receive mine on launch day and it has been a great experience learning the different features Pixel offers. I love all this new technology but will admit that my view points are based solely on what I see and experience just like the average person. I will try to be as unbiased as possible but will also highlight things that I enjoyed the most. As I said in my initial review, I was not too convinced about switching over but after 3 months I would say that I will be on Pixel for a while. BUILD*  I mentioned this the first time during my initial review of the Pixel P9XL but will mention it again. I was always interested in the Google Pixel but they always looked very poorly made. When I would go see them at my local Best Buy they felt very flimsy as well. The Pixel P9XL at first glance looked like the previous model but the camera housing had changed just a bit. It went from being a bar across the top back to being an oval shaped housing. I personally felt that this made the phone look better because it made that chrome coloring of the housing much more bearable. I am not much of a fan of chrome on things, just looks tacky lol but then again that is just my preference. With that aside, the Pixel P9XL is much lighter than my previous, the IPhone 13PM. I noticed it right away as soon as I took it out of the box. The phone was very light but felt durable and looked premium. 3 months later I still do enjoy the pixel and like the premium look it gives off. I chose the Hazel Pro XL model but I will admit I believe that the Pixel looks best in their Peony color. But that is also just a preference. One other I will point out is that I always had a worry that the camera housing would get damaged due to sticking out. After usage for this long I have not gotten a scratch on the camera house. Sadly I did drop it once in the first week and it has an internal scratch that was caused by what I believe is the camera lens inside. So far I don't believe it has affected picture or video quality. I have kept my Pixel P9XL in a Spigen Ultra Hybrid case along with an Amazon choice screen glass protector. The P9XL has a feature for when you equip a screen protector that allows it to read your fingerprint and all gestures normally. The feature is available but even with the screen protector on I have not really had a need for it. Overall the design of the phone looks and feels premium and as many had pointed out it gives a similar feel to the IPhone models. I wouldn’t say that is a bad thing.SCREEN	* The screen for the Pixel P9XL is pretty good. When out in direct sunlight the screen gets bright enough to not have any difficulty seeing what I am doing. I have adaptive brightness and spend most of my day indoors so I never really do have to set my screen to a high level of brightness. The screen sensitivity settings can be altered whenever you put on a screen protector as previously stated but you most likely won't need too. I opted to get the XL version so I am really enjoying the 6.8 in screen and the small punch hole front camera I feel does not interfere with everyday use or when watching videos. Colors are great when watching videos or playing games as well. BATTERY LIFE* I have read various posts on here from new pixel users that their battery life just isn't great. I was in the same boat in the beginning but after a couple of weeks of letting my Pixel adapt to my usage, my battery life significantly improved. I will be using my day to day as a base for how long my battery lasts, everybody's usage varies but this example is more to get an idea of how good the battery life on the Pixel P9XL is. As I said it has been around 3 months with the Pixel P9XL. I leave it at full charge before going to bed, my first alarm rings at 4:30 am so that I can get up and get ready to go to the gym. I usually spend an hour to an 1.5 at the gym which I only use for playing music on Spotify. By the time I start my work day at 8 am my Pixel is usually at 88-92% of battery. I will do some pretty heavy scroll thru my phone throughout the day. I call my wife, check my socials and email. By the time my workday is done at 530 pm, I am running at 35-40% but it is usually more on the lower end. I usually don’t get back to constantly use it until I am about to head into bed just to check any last minute emails and whatnot. At that time it is 1030 pm when I am setting my phone to charge. So I would say battery life is pretty good. Just takes a couple of weeks to recognize your usage.CAMERA* I have been using my camera non stop and have been loving the pictures that come out. I have only been using stock settings to take photos. I have always enjoyed being able to just point and shoot and be able to produce a good quality picture. I will switch to night mode or how google calls it night sight, it comes in handy in low light settings. I will have to say when compared to my wife’s 15 Pro, her night pictures do come out a bit better. But Pixel P9XL still produces a great shot and the features in the google studio allow you to edit pictures to your liking. Google studio has really come in handy for me when taking pictures of my newborn, allowing me to hold her up with my hand and then just erase my hand out of the pictures. One thing I will point out, when zooming in and out there is a small lag in between which isn’t too bothersome.. If you don't pay attention to it haha. I have taken a couple of videos and enjoy the quality. Videos look super smooth and crisp, sadly the zooming lag also affects videos and is very noticeable when zooming in and out during videos. Not a deal breaker but can be bothersome at times. Software* I am not much of a software guy but will say that the pixel IU is more suited for people that want to personalize their phone to their liking. Gives the phone a much more personal feeling. I have also seen on many subreddits various third party apps that you can get to customize your app shapes and colors. Although I plan to keep my Pixel stock, I like that the option to customize my Pixel even further is there. One thing that I do not like and continue to experience is apps taking forever to load up or sometimes they just crash. Nothing major but kind of weird. Overall, I am enjoying my Pixel P9XL. After ten years of being on Apple, Pixel has been something more refreshing. There is a lot more to the Pixel P9XL that I definitely didn’t cover but like I said this is just a simple review of my 3 months after switching from IPhone. At first I would miss things such as IMessage and Facetime but over time I just stopped even thinking about it. If you’re thinking of switching over from IPhone I would say give it a try 🙂EDIT: Someone did mention what I forgot to mention which is the notification delays. I've had it happen a couple times but it isn't as persistent or nagging to me as it has been to other from what I've read on here. I just didn't mention it bc it was something that rarely occured to me but it is worth mentioning as everyone else is having different experiences "
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","What is Wrong With These Phones?+I've been a Pixel user for many years now. I had the Pixel 2, (loved it), then the Pixel 6, (loved it), and then last February, I traded it in for the Pixel 8 for free. Here's where things start to become extremely irritating and frustrating. I loved my Pixel 6. Only reason I traded it in for the Pixel 8 was because A.) If I traded it in, I got the Pixel 8 for free. And B.) The battery was absolutely shot in it and would barely hold a 4-5 hour charge. So, got it last February some time. At first, it was fine. I didn't notice really anything different upgrading from the 6 to the 8, besides the better battery life of course. Fast forward, as the months go on, I begin to notice some severe performance issues in the phone. It was overheating CONSTANTLY. Even when I was barely using the phone. My girlfriend and I are long distance, and we talk mostly via text and Snapchat. So often, we will have 2 conversations going on at once. For some reason, this would overheat my phone tremendously. It would overheat it to the point that Snapchat would stop sending me notifications for Snapchat. Half the time, I would never get a notification that she messaged me back. The other half of the time, I'd get a notification, but only after exactly 10 minutes of her sending it. This became exceedingly frustrating for the both of us. Also, with text messages, a lot of the time it would just spin and spin and spin and then say ""! Message not sent."" So I would have to resend it. However, it's not even like the phone would tell me it didn't send. It just... Wouldn't. Only until my girlfriend would ask me on Snapchat why I didn't text her back would I notice the message failed to send. However, despite these issues, (and other laggy issues), I kept using the phone because of the ""free phone fine print"" I should've read better through my carrier. Low and behold, the phone is free, (with Verizon paying the balance of the phone), OVER the course of 3 years. If I upgrade the phone, I have to pay the remaining balance. So, I just figured I'd suffer with it, since by this point I was used to its constant issues. Now, let's jump to last month. I go to bed, everything is fine. I wake up, and my Pixel 8 isn't working with anything Google related. No, I'm not kidding. I could not access my Gmail, my text messages, my notes, my photos, Chrome, ANYTHING Google related. But I could still access Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok, etc just fine. It's like the whole ""Google"" part of the Google phone just... died? No phone calls either. So, I went to Verizon, and, (shout out to the Verizon rep), he finagled me a deal. Apparently last month, Verizon was offering free Pixel 9s with a new line. Long story short, the dude gave me a new line, but transferred my phone number to the new phone, and the new phone number is just a ""ghost line."" This way, Verizon is still paying off the Pixel 8, and, now they are paying off the Pixel 9 in the same way. But now here we are, about a month since I've had this new phone... And low and behold, I'm starting to see the same exact issues happen that I did with my Pixel 8. I can't switch between apps without them restarting completely. For example, if I'm watching a TikTok, then go to text my girlfriend, when I re-open TikTok, the whole app just restarts and I lose the video I was on. Earlier, I was taking photos for things to sell on eBay while watching a YouTube video, and after 3-4 pictures, YouTube crashes and stops the video. When I open Snapchat or my texts, the whole phone freezes. It's starting to lag. Today it's been overheating like crazy. When I open Snapchat and click to type my message, the keyboard won't even pop up. I have to restart the app 2-3 times to get it to work.The last phone, my GB were pretty maxed out. With this phone, that's not the case at all. I've kept this phone a lot more clean in terms of storage, but yet I'm again experiencing the same issues I was on the Pixel 8. So my question is, what is WRONG with these phones? Is it just me? Is it something I'm doing? Some type of setting? It's just extremely frustrating. Right now, I can't even text my girlfriend because my text messages are stuck on the watch symbol and for the life of me will not send. I loved my Pixel 2 and my Pixel 6. They were the best phones I had ever had. However, my experience with the 8 and 9 so far have been nothing short of awful, and I'm actually considering switching to Samsung. The guy at Verizon told me he hasn't heard anyone complain about the Pixel 9. But I'm just experiencing the same exact issues I was before. I couldn't even transfer anything from my Pixel 8 because everything Google UI related completely died. I'm scared the same thing is going to happen with this phone too. Any advice? "
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Service, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Things People Complain About Are Pointless+It bugs me sometimes that the people who complain about certain aspects of the Pixel line are looking at this product from a lens of someone below the age of 18. This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13"" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it ""exciting""? Not really. But its out of my way and out of my mind, it just works, and if it doesn't, I don't notice it."
negative,"[' experience, user, technical, voice, wifi, bluetooth']","I actually like my Pixel 8 Pro+Had my phone now for two months. I consider myself a power user and a shutter bug, so I need a phone with welly and a decent camera. I do a lot of tinkering with Tasker and Termux and have these burning away in the background.I came from the Pixel 3a, to Pixel 5 and now the Pixel 8 Pro. I also rock a Samsung S20 5G, which coupled the weak CPU in the Pixel 5. I now have a single device to tinker on.Camera is almost flawless. I mean, no camera is perfect, but so far it's definitely the best camera on a phone I've had my hands on (admittedly, I avoid Apple). Photos and videos are of outstanding, professional quality and that's before editing it.Battery is flipping awesome. From the overuse of my P5 and S20, their batteries are not holding up as much, so charging became commonplace. I still use the S20 for some things and each time I go to put it on charge, the Pixel 8P still has over 70% left (after 12 or more hours). Have played CoD and Metalstorm a lot (at high res and 60fps), even over 5G and the battery still holds it's own. Device does get warm, I'd be rather worried if it didn't with what it was doing!UI/UX. Well, it's classic Android as always. Under the hood Google have added some cool AI features and gestures. Double tap to back takes some fiddling over the P5, but I am wearing a shock case on the P8P. I had to turn off the animations, mind (Developer Menu or via Accessibility). They were too smooth/slow for my liking, I prefer a snappy UI. I have switched to using Nova (8.x) as my launcher and use 3 button navigation (am an old timer, so shhh! 😂).Biometrics. Well, I don't know what it wrong with everyone else, but I even have a hardened glass on my P8P and have had an easy 98/100 success rate. I do prefer either back or side mounted, but the under screen does come in useful when you can't pick up phone. Fortunately, the S20 has screen fingerprint, so had time to get used to one. Oh and it has face unlock, which seems to know when you're using a photo instead of a person. This creeped me out with one of my banking apps. Opened it, looked away as it loaded, looked back to see my balances 😖. If you have a Pixel watch, you can even unlock your phone from watch.Network. I use two SIMs (eSIM+SIM) on this. One is very 5G available and the other is mostly used for calls and texts, as well as backup data. The phone is mostly on cell, 5G being very common. The other network does have 5G, but only in some areas (EE UK and Vodafone UK). I did this with my Pixel 5 as well as my S20 (have at least two different networks, giving me access to all 4 MNO's in the UK (Three, O2, EE, Vodafone)). Despite what I've read of others, I don't experience overheating or excessive battery drain. I will admit, the phone did not like one of my WiFi 5 WPA3 only access points. Just outright refuses to connect to it. Every other AP and it's fine. Speed of both 4G/5G and WiFi 5 are as expected. Haven't tested a 6/6e AP, yet.Power user friendliness. It's a frigging beast! I've thrown all kinds of shenanigans at it. Compiled a few wheels in Termux for python, as well as some ham radio tools and onboard AI and it storms through. Tasker is doing a variety of things based on conditions and events, including reactions to the logcat. With 9 cores and 12GB RAM, it has welly to go wading all day long. Neither have been terminated in background and phantom processes aren't killed. I used my S20 for most of this, as it has 12GB RAM, too. Now it's all being offloaded to the Pixel as it's just outright faster. Still waiting to test out UWB, too.Questions? Please do ask. "

London cell networks are struggling, so it was no surprise that while calls were going through, data mostly didn't work (Either it showed full signal or it showed an exclamation mark).A simple WhatsApp text message took me 30-45 mins of retrying to send. But then I'm looking next to me. My wife with an iPhone 15 Pro Max (same network as me) scrolling Instagram.

I, for one, learned the hard way and this is my experience... These devices are riddled with bugs, glitches, manufacturer flaws and a slew of other downright annoying ""features."" Google Customer Support is all but useless. If you have anything currently in ""escalation,"" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their ""certified repair partner"" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a ""certified"" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a ""Manager,"" ""Supervisor,"" or member of the ""Escalation Team"" in 24-48 hours? Rest assured, you will NOT be contacted. And if by some miracle you are contacted, the person likely won't speak in your native tongue, AND will likely have more questions than answers! I was in awe: ""Excuse me? You called me back a month later as a member of the Escalation Team and YOU are asking ME what seems to be the problem?!?"" Honestly, it's like you're talking to the first line of defense all over again...Only to be forwarded and transferred all over the place to be asked the same questions a dozen more times. As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the ""extended warranties"" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly. But a simple Google search (I know, Google, right?!?) will flood you with warranty info, defect issues and a plethora of horror stories similar to mine. Do not get lost in the shiney new toy. Stick with what you know.It really should have never gotten to this point, as any reputable company would have just fixed the phone or, hell, even replaced the damn thing! And for those of you with screen defects, it doesn't simply get better with a ""repair."" A coworker of mine had their Pixel screen replaced THREE times only to have the problem persist within weeks if not days. Replacing a faulty display with a faulty display doesn't help too much. Hope this helps anyone out there who is on the fence about their next phone!"

I've primarily used Chinese phones (Xiaomi, Oppo) and haven't experienced hardware issues with any of the 3 phones I've owned over the past 10 years.I updated phones due to receiving new ones as gifts or rewards in competitions, or when software support ended.My current phone is an Oppo A52, which I bought in 2020 at a very low price. I put a cheap case on it and have dropped it frequently. I even use the phone under light / heavy rain although the phone is not water resistant. The phone feels like a rock to me.I'm considering upgrading to a Pixel 8 for its long-term software support and to try a ""high-quality"" phone with a better camera. However, I've noticed on Reddit and elsewhere online that the Pixel series seems to have reliability issues, with reports of green lines on the screen or connectivity problems. I'm puzzled by how such an expensive phone, costing twice as much as my current Oppo, could be so unreliable. Are people's expectations too high?For context, I rarely use my phone, mostly for authenticator apps and calling. My 4-year-old Oppo A52 still lasts all day.For those experiencing issues with the Pixel series, how frequently do you use your phone? I'd appreciate more information to help me decide whether to go for a Pixel phone or try an iPhone for the first time"

No problems here as he's able to get 5G data and everything. However, he occasionally goes to China, and switches to the chinese sim card and will get no data at all. He can makes calls but can't get online. Even if his friends hot spot him (with a chinese sim i suppose), he can't get any internet connection. I just assumed since this sim has a China phone number and uses China's network there'd be no problems when he's across the border.If he uses the HK sim card and data roams there's no issue, but that's not a long term solution as the data he has for roaming isn't a lot. I've looked around and seen people talk about Pixel IMS + Shizuku to help them get around some network issues. So i guess my question is, will that be able to help him connect to the internet when he's in China using the China sim, and if not what other solutions are there? "
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Video Issues, Others, Technical']","My Experience Switching from Samsung to Google Pixel 9 Pro XL +Hey everyone! A few days ago, I made the leap from my beloved Samsung S21+ to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. I was pretty nervous about switching brands, but I’m genuinely surprised by how much I love this new phone!First off, the design is sleek and modern, and the camera is absolutely stunning. The battery life has also been a pleasant surprise—it lasts much longer than I expected! However, there are a few things that have irked me along the way:1. Edge Panels: I used to rely heavily on the edge panels on my Samsung for quick access to the calculator. I really missed that feature at first. I found an app called ""Panels"" that somewhat replaces it, but it’s not quite the same. I ended up downloading a calculator app with a widget, but it was hard to find one that met my needs, and it just doesn’t compare to the Samsung calculator in the edge panel.2. Themed Icons: I activated the ""themed icons"" feature, but it really bugs me that about 80% of my apps don’t have icons. It looks so disorganized! I enjoyed the extensive customization options on my Samsung, where I could download different themes that changed the icons and more.3. Google Photos: I have to say, I really dislike Google Photos. I miss the Samsung Gallery—it felt much more user-friendly and straightforward in my opinion.4. Search Bar Location: Initially, I wasn’t a fan of the search bar at the bottom of the screen, especially since I was used to having the Google widget at the top on my S21+. However, I’ve gotten used to it and don’t mind it as much anymore!Final Tip: For anyone considering a switch from Samsung to Google Pixel, make sure to import your Samsung Notes to a different app beforehand. I lost all my important notes during the transition, and the same goes for your calendar—those won’t carry over either!Overall, I’m really enjoying my Pixel 9 Pro XL despite a few bumps in the road. If you have any advice or tips for a newcomer to the Pixel family, I’d love to hear them! "

I was satisfied with the phone and especially the pixel software, even though most Pixel-exclusive features aren't a thing in countries outside the US. After about a year, my phone began to restart unexpectedly while in my pocket. Occasionally, the screen would display a strange green tint before crashing. I found out after some trial and error that when pressed (such as being in a pocket) around the area where the screen connects to the motherboard it would crash and restart the whole phone. I got in contact with google support and they asked me to send in my device, and then they shipped a replacement back. All fine and dandy, except annoying that this happened in the middle of my exam period and switching phones is still a hassle and a lot of work.Now we come to this year, 1,5 weeks ago to be exact. When I pick up my phone from my desk it suddenly doesn't work anymore, the screen is totally black and no response from touch. I thought it had suddenly turned off but I could still feel vibrations so that was very weird. I force restarted it by holding the buttons but to no avail, the screen was fully dead, without any cracks or damage anywhere on the device. I connected it to my PC and using a little program called SCRCPY I was able to duplicate the phone to my PC and interact with it, despite the 7 series having no normal display output. On my PC I could see everything was fine with the rest of the phone and the only things that didn't work were the display, touch and fingerprint reader. It was as if they had just wholly disconnected. I had of course done the usual troubleshooting things and transferred again everything back to my 6 year old oneplus (still functioning, as you would expect from a phone).So, again what seems like the same (or at least related) problem as the year before, again in full exam period, nice! I contacted support again via chat, and due to the late hour only English support was available (I live in Belgium). I explained the problems and nice detail, all of this happened around 2 weeks after the 2 year warranty ended, yay! They said they would escalate it to a higher support tier and they would decide what should happen. I genuinely expected them to replace it again, despite being just 2 weeks out of warranty, since it was clearly a recurring issue and not caused by any misuse on my part. The phone didn't have a single crack, scratch, line or anything of the sort so normal phones don't spontaneously brick their screen without any of these things.The support (See link to other post with screenshots) replied via email in what I found quite unclear and ambiguous terms, so I had to send a couple mails back and forth to really clarify what they meant. The thing is no matter what it would always at least take a day to get a response and she would always respond in the middle of the night. She said that the RMA was denied and that I would have to pay to get it fixed. As I saw this wasn't going anywhere, as she didn't even once ask for pictures and denied any request I had to talk to higher tier support, I gave up and tried the Dutch language telephone support next.The Dutch telephone support agent was very friendly and wanted to help, but again he had no say in the matter as it was 2 weeks out of warranty and had to be put on hold so he could call to the higher tier support for a decision. He really got my situation and himself really wanted to get an RMA for me as this obviously is a ridiculous case where 2 times in 2 years some mysterious fault happened with the screen. After being on the line for over 50 minutes, most of that time waiting on hold waiting for the decision, he informed me that the upper tier support denied any RMA and I would have to have it repaired on my own dime. He didn't understand himself why it was denied as for him this seemed straightforward to him but the almighty ANTI-CUSTOMER support decided they were greedy and wanted more money for a manufacturing fault.I decide to open up the phone myself (photos in the other post linked above) and couldn't find a single thing that stood out that could've failed. I dis- and reconnected the display to see if that would solve it, but no luck. I don't even know if it is a display issue or an issue on the device side, so I can't just know for certain that a screen replacement would fix it. Sending it in alone costs €88 without any repairs being done to the phone, so fuck them and I bought the Oneplus 13 to replace this piece of shit.I know not every pixel is like this, as I have recommended them to a lot of family members and there aren't any problems with them, but I didn't buy a 1000 euro device to then have this total shitshow for my money. I'll make sure none of them will buy a Pixel ever again.TLDR; Pixel 7 pro broke twice with the same design fault, the second time it was 2 weeks out of warranty and google has been fully unhelpful and denied any repair, replacement or other solution. Beware of the quality of these phones, because 7 years of software updates are useless if the phone only lasts 2 years. If anyone has ideas of what could have happened or similar experiences with Google Support, feel free to comment!"

I decided it was finally time to upgrade from my old Galaxy S20 Ultra to a newer device. I had always gone with Samsung handsets in the past but decided to give the pro 9 fold a try. While i appreciate the phone and understand its not going to have the same battery life as my past one, i will say i am not pleased with the build quality. Tonight when i was sitting on the couch watching the hockey game i decided to open my phone to check my fantasy hockey teams score. I was just playing a game on the open screen moments earlier before and it was working fine, but when i opened it again i all of a sudden had a line of pixels out. I have not even owned this phone for 90 days yet (coming up on 1/22) and am having to send it back now. I have had other issues that have popped up here and there (going from open to closed screen then bringing up the app drawer has rescaling issues, problems with multiscreen app use(which i  know may be app related). I called customer support to see about getting a replacement and the first person from my call back drops and doesn't call back. I reach back out through chat and they tell me i can either buy a new one and when they get my old one back they will take the hold off of my card, or i can send it in and get a new one back within 14 days from when they get my broken phone. I just paid you 2000 less than 3 months ago, im not letting you hold more of my money. I am lucky i held onto my old samsung and it is working fine (just upgraded because it was at end of life dev wise) so i can use that in the mean time. The best part came when she told me the phone i get back could be refurbished. You would imagine that with that much spent on a device they would provide you a new one. just hoping the next one i get can last longer than 3 months."

This post is an update to that previous post. As I previously mentioned, using an unlocked Pixel 7 Pro with my Brazilian carrier (TIM) allowed no access to their 5G network, despite being in an area well covered in 5G with a 5G plan and 5G ""capable"" phone. There seemed to be an exception to this whenever I switched service to my Google Fi sim, seemingly allowing 5G access to be whitelisted through Google Fi's MVNO and roaming agreement.Well, I have an update that I think many people will appreciate! I broke my Pixel 7 Pro a few weeks when I dropped it getting out of an Uber and decided, after much consternation, to replace it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, even though I knew I may be continuing my 5G problem.  I decided to have my phone activated in the United States before having it shipped for 2 reasons. First, to satisfy the promotion I received I needed to activate it before October 30th and shipping something to Brazil is never predictable. Second, there's often issues with provisioning and activating phones intended to be used in the U.S. on U.S. Carter's if done outside of the country. So I preferred to ensure it activated and provisioned correctly with my U.S. number prior to receiving it. This required me to deactivate my Google Fi sim and service on the broken phone I have here in Brazil that I'm replacing. So, I currently only have my Brazilian TIM service active on my phone. It's been about a day and half since I did that and I had not left my house since then and was on wifi the whole time because I live in a bit of a rural area with limited cell service until I get a few kilometres close to the city. Leaving the house to go into the city for the first time in a couple days today I saw something very exciting pop up on my phone....5G! Now, I have also recently updated my phone to Android 15, so I can't be 100% certain what has triggered 5G to suddenly be available on my Pixel 7 Pro.  It can only be 3 possibilities, which I'm listing in order of probability (In my personal opinion):1. Deactivating my U.S. service from the phone removed some restriction that was present before. 2. Android 15 included some update that enabled 5G access that previous versions did not allow3. Google expanded 5G access to additional countries not previously covered (which I doubt because I think there would have been some sort of announcement) I hope it's the 2nd or 3rd scenario because it will mean I will have 5G access on my new Pixel 9 Pro XL even it arrives but I think it is too much of a coincidence for it not to be the 1st scenario. No matter what scenario it is (I will know when my new phone arrives) there is good news to be found here. If it is scenario 1, it potentially means you CAN buy an unlocked Pixel and use it with 5G access in Central and South American countries (at the very least Brazil). It used to only be that I saw 5G when I was actively using my Google Fi sim for data and calls. In this scenario, even when I switched service to my local Brazilian sim (with the Fi sim still on ""standby"" in the background ready to be used), I would lose 5G access. So maybe it was the complete deactivation of this service when I switched it to the new phone that enabled 5G.Either way, I am hopeful. I truly hope this was just a coincidence and something else on the software side happened or, even better, Google is rolling out 5G access to their Pixel lineup in additional countries and just hasn't announced it yet!? I'll also say that I've seen that you can root and modify phones to gain unrestricted 5G access in unsupported countries, which I might try if I find that Google locks me out of 5G access once I am again using my new dual sim phone with U.S. service on one sim and Brazilian service on the other.We shall see!"
negative,"[' Service, Support']","Activating Pixel ""Google One AI Premium"" Promotion Will Invalidate Existing Google Store Credits For Existing Orders+Hello everyone, I've spent the last two days suffering through Google Store / Google One support. To quickly summarize; Google One grants you a 10% credit on all hardware orders through the Google Store. My wife and I placed an order for two Pixel Pro 9s and a Pixel Watch 3. The 10% credit, combined with the promotional credits and a nice trade-in offer convinced us to upgrade from two Pixel Pro 8s (which we were very happy with). I received my phone first, which I activated/traded-in, while we waited to receive my wife's phone and the Pixel Watch 3.I activated the Google One AI Premium for 1 year free promotional offer that comes with the Pixel Pro 9s. At no time did I see any warning language that said that the promotional offer disqualifies you from the 10% Google Store credit. A few weeks go buy and we receive the other Pixel Pro 9 and the Pixel Watch 3. I receive the $200 promotional credit from the 2nd phone, but not the 10% credit, so I reach out to Google Support.I will spare you from the details of the worst Google support experience I've ever personally participated in, but it takes four support (including one that refused a manager escalation and transferred me without permission) to get to someone willing to contact a manager. I will include the transcripts. The manager eventually emails me and says that since I'm on the Google One AI Premium plan, I do not qualify for the 10% Store Credits even though the orders had already been placed. Google is refusing to issue the credits.The AI Premium features are not worth the $130+ dollars of credits I'm losing, not to mention losing out on future 10% Google Store credits for at least a year. I don't think the AI Premium features are even worth $25 a month and was planning to downgrade at the end of the promotional 1 year free.In an attempt to resolve this, I have downgraded back to a paid Google One plan. I will let you know what the manager responds with. Transcripts and emails will be posted below.I tried posting this to r/Google and mods deleted the post. "

I was really excited to pair them with my Pixel 9 Pro XL, expecting a smooth experience given they're both G.However, I've noticed a significant sound delay—ranging from 0.5 to 1 full second in some cases. The first instance was with the keyboard feedback sound; after I’d stopped typing, the audio was still lagging behind.

YouTube Music plays fine, and apps like Algoriddim's Djay are also working without delay.

Here are my observations so far+I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

Super Res Zoom shaking is also still active.### 4.9x - 9.6xStandard telephoto. ### 9.7x - 19.9xGoogle claims they are cropping the middle pixels just like with 2x, but I can't tell any difference vs 9.6x.

No middle pixels, no fusing. At 2x and beyond, it looks worse than 12 MP.### 4.9x - 30xStandard telephoto.# ConclusionFor best resolution and quality in daylight and for still objects:### 0.5x - 0.9xUse 50 MP *only* under very good lighting conditions and with a tripod, otherwise use 12 MP.### 1x - 1.9xUse 50 MP.## 2x - 4.9xUse 12 MP.### 5x - 7xUse 50 MP.### 7x - 30xUse 12 MP.## Caveats ### MotionWhen the subject is in motion, always use 12 MP.### Low lightEven for night shots, under my extensive testing, the 12 MP will typically do better at all zoom ranges in preserving details in the shadows. This isn't always the case though. If you use Night Sight with decent lighting and can max out the slider on shutter speed, then you will get a good/better image with 50 MP.### Top shotYou don't get this with 50 MP.### Final wordI spent many hours on this. I did very extensive pixel peeping, zooming in and cropping to obscene levels after the photos were taken. These things won't be visible on a normal viewing on a phone screen.### Images[Here is the album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOSr_o7Gg4UysWyBi0fQMhfpSEmF9e-SaDKS_gRA6VGb_EzmKXSRKWTpRk_qLPQqg?key=MHRuam84R2F0dDN5ZFREclMxbUtMYnVndC1xVU9n) of photos that I took to analyze.Note: I've added direct notes to each image which explains what that image is.

It seems Google has done a better job this year blending the two different images.EDIT: So apparently it's a 4.85x telephoto and not 5x. I've updated my testing to reflect this. However, I'm not changing the numbers because it's too close to 5x and sometimes the lens won't switch anyway because the phone will prefer the main sensor in non-perfect lighting, plus the quick tap number is 5x."

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up. (Now if only we could adopt longer battery life to smart watches ::cough:: pixel watch ::cough::)Edit 4 - ended my day of normal-high usage at 25%. Woke up with it at 6:45 AM and laying down in bed with it now at 11:30 PM. ## Performance I don't really game much on my phone but it played Pokemon Go very easily.## Gemini vs Google Assistant? It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. 😂The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro. New phone has me with new lingo already Edit 5 - reworded the Gemini and Google Assistant section to make more sense. "

It really is a great phone. However, there are just too many quality of life features on the Samsung phones that I can't ignore. I came from a 1,5 year old S23 Ultra and there are many things that i used daily that i really miss as more than just gimmicky.- folders: you cant have folders in the pixel app draw. I really dont understand why. This means you can only have folders on the home screen, something which i dont want as i usually have a very clean home screen. I didn't realise how much i used folders until now..- files and folders: I use my phones for work a lot and its just easier to download/find/access files on the samsung. I cant explain exactly what this is but if i have to send a file/photo I have downloaded via whatsapp or email its just easier to do on the Samsung. On the Pixel, half the time i cant find the damn file I literally just downloaded unless I'm using the file app. But from within an app (Gmail, Whatsapp) its not as easy to find.- sound silence: on the samsung i just pull down from the top and in my quick settings i can silence/vibrate my phone. On tthe pixel you have to hit the volume button, then the click the icon then choose silence icon.- At a glance: Why on earth can you not get rid of this widget or the google search bar on the home screen? Its taking space which id rather use for something else and i dont want to use another launcher to get rid of them.- Edge panel: i really miss this from the Samsung phone. Its just so handy to access apps i use regularly. Yes, you can install a third party app on the pixel, but its not the same.- Goodlock: The amount of customization allowed via this app is superb. Customization on the poxel lock screen for example is very limited in comparison.- Routines: Nothing even remotely close. Yes, there are apps for this, but its not the same as the ones offered on the Samsung phones.- Battery: I thought my year and a half year old S23Ultra was beginning to lack in this department. However, the pixel (brand new) under the same usage/load is lasting the same and even a little less than my Samsung. Thats not say its not good! Its just not as good as i hoped considering how old my Samsung is.- Wallets: The good thing about Samsung is that you can have both Google Wallet and Samsung wallet running at the same time. So you can have multiple cards even if they dont all work on Google Wallet (minor gripe though).- Gamaxy watch: yes, i got my new Ultra watch working with the pixel, but i had to side load a few apps and the gear software really hits the battery hard. Performance using a samsung phone ia much more optimised, this is normal i guess since it's a samsung product after all.- Wallpapers: you cant have video wallpapers on the picel unless you use a third party app such as video to wallpaper, which you have to pay for and its not great since you cant have a different video from your homescreen and lockscreen. You can have one or the either or both the same, but not 2 separate videos. Samsung also allows for a list of inages/videos that you can randomly scroll through everytime you unlock your phone.Again, im not saying the Pixel is not a great phone. It really is, but after you get over the gimmicky AI tools, its really rather simple. Camera, OS in general, performance etc are all excellent. I guess, had I not come from a Samsung phone, I would have been perfectly happy with the Pixel.So for those coming from a Samsung, if you are happy with thr Samsung OS, make sure you consider all these things.I'll be selling mine for £900 including official case and screen protectors (from Europe) if anyone is interested.Sorry guys, i tried!"

negative,"[' ""service, experience""']","Pixel 4a forced battery replacement - a happy ending+Like many of you - my pixel 4a got the battery-crippling update a few days ago. My phone went from working fine and getting a full day of normal use, to draining several percentage per minute while in active use and only lasting a few hours.I live in a large metro area with many authorized repair centers, so I went that route and got the free battery replacement today.It really couldn't have gone smoother - they had it swapped out in 2 hours, and after the work was completed my phone was no longer in 'battery jail' from Google.I am pretty sure that the repair center must report the IMEI number back to Google to tell them that the battery was replaced, and then that triggers the phone charging functionality to be restored.Either way - my phone is totally back to normal now and with a brand new battery. Rapid charging works again and it's back to the usual battery life.I'm sharing my experience in case others were wondering about the battery replacement option. If you are hoping to keep your 4a, and live near a reputable repair center, then this is definitely the way to go."

While there were workarounds for Pixel 8-series users, Pixel 9 users have been stuck without it since launch.As a big fan of the feature, I'm glad I can now use it again without having to switch between camera apps to take normal pictures or worrying about crashes.UPDATE:It looks like some users are reporting that this isn't working on the Pixel 9 Pro XL or the 9 Pro Fold. The 9 Pro seems to work. No data on the regular 9."

Both times sounded identical. It plays at full volume and I never keep my phone at full volume for any setting.It plays at full volume with a static noise and has sort of a ""WEEyowwww..."" With a twang to it. Mostly a static-y robotic sound, but not completely - reminding me of the battle stations SFX from Battlestar Galactica. 😂 The sound makes me want to dive on the floor for cover as if it's some strange air raid alert.It's 3 seconds long and the sounds made compared to last time were identical in sound+length+volume.Both times I was actively using my phone but just casually scrolling Reddit with the (shitty) app. No background services doing anything notable.

negative,"[' Audio Issues: [""audio"", ""sound""]\n   User Experience: [""experience"", ""user""]']","Pixel Buds Pro 2s - my first couple of hours+Hi allSo my pair arrived this morning, and I already have a few thoughts on them.  Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and I'm not a pro reviewer or anything.Firstly, wow these are so small and light!  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big.  They are really comfy to wear too. Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2.117 for buds and 1.55 for case.The sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s.  I haven't played with the EQ and probably won't to be honest, because songs are recorded at so many different levels you'll be constantly fiddling with it, so I just leave it as is.  I'm also over fifty now so my hearing isn't top notch!The noise cancelling is excellent, and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far. All of it feels really nicely made, the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is like.Now for the problems.Now this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned, but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far.  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially, but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit.  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering, my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding.  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phone.Then when I put my hood up and starting jogging back, the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off.  Very annoying! Especially in the rain with a dog.Anyway, once this happened it was like the earphones crashed.  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again.  So I don't know if this is a software glitch or not, but I'm not going back out into the rain too test then again!Another thing is knowing where to tap them.  You can't see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance, you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track.  I'm going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment.  Airpods just work so much better in this regard.Anyway, these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours.  Perhaps after some use I'll get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them.  I hope so because they're lovely and sound and cancelling are great.EDIT: Forgot to mention, the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for it.EDIT2: multi-point connection works really really well for me.EDIT3: after saying all that about the multi point, it's stopped working!  Nothing will play on my Pixel now.  I had to put the buds back in the box, shut down all my media apps, shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work.  Poor!  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future. Sigh ..."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical (audio, experience, technical)']","Things People Complain About Are Pointless+It bugs me sometimes that the people who complain about certain aspects of the Pixel line are looking at this product from a lens of someone below the age of 18. This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13"" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it ""exciting""? Not really. But its out of my way and out of my mind, it just works, and if it doesn't, I don't notice it."

I, for one, learned the hard way and this is my experience... These devices are riddled with bugs, glitches, manufacturer flaws and a slew of other downright annoying ""features."" Google Customer Support is all but useless. If you have anything currently in ""escalation,"" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their ""certified repair partner"" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a ""certified"" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a ""Manager,"" ""Supervisor,"" or member of the ""Escalation Team"" in 24-48 hours? Rest assured, you will NOT be contacted. And if by some miracle you are contacted, the person likely won't speak in your native tongue, AND will likely have more questions than answers! I was in awe: ""Excuse me? You called me back a month later as a member of the Escalation Team and YOU are asking ME what seems to be the problem?!?"" Honestly, it's like you're talking to the first line of defense all over again...Only to be forwarded and transferred all over the place to be asked the same questions a dozen more times. As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the ""extended warranties"" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly. But a simple Google search (I know, Google, right?!?) will flood you with warranty info, defect issues and a plethora of horror stories similar to mine. Do not get lost in the shiney new toy. Stick with what you know.It really should have never gotten to this point, as any reputable company would have just fixed the phone or, hell, even replaced the damn thing! And for those of you with screen defects, it doesn't simply get better with a ""repair."" A coworker of mine had their Pixel screen replaced THREE times only to have the problem persist within weeks if not days. Replacing a faulty display with a faulty display doesn't help too much.

I can't believe how fast and overall good this feature is now: no more issues with RCS messages, Authenticator, etc.   It was fast but there are a couple of gotchas -- avoid my mistakes by taking steps on the old phone first !  ( I hastily reset mine too quickly).1. Disable Find My Phone in Settings. 2. Ideally remove your credit cards first, on the old Wallet, but it turns out that if you don't, Google notices that and dissassociates them from the old device, and you can go ahead and re-add them on the new one. So this is a mistake with no penalty.3. Now for the big ouch.  Most Transit passes and some cards with stored value do not transition over automically, and it's a major customer serivce operation to try to restore them on the new phone, unless you have followed some very specific instructions first.  I have Orca for Seattle and Clipper for the Bay and both are just gone.  If I go into Wallet I can only add a new fresh card without my credits.  So look up the specific instructions for each card BEFORE the upgrade because most will require steps taken on the old phone before the upgrade.  I'll post Orca's procedure as an example:https://support.myorca.com/hc/en-us/articles/28049799154061-How-to-transfer-your-digital-ORCA-Card-to-another-Android-Phone#:~:text=To%20transfer%20an%20ORCA%20card,Wallet%20on%20an%20Android%20phone.&text=For%20security%20purposes%2C%20transferring%20a,a%20limited%20number%20of%20times.Quick observations FWIW:* It seems that you can now use AI to turn any kind of picture of a physical card or pass into a digital pass in Google wallet, it's very cool and it works.  eg, I went into my car insurance app, and got their PDF ""proof of insurance card"" which doesn't support Wallet.  Did a screen grab, click on ""Everything Else"" in Wallet and it did OCR and created a digital equivalent, with the picture attached. Nice!* I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the reviews, but I think the speaker is quite amazing.Edits: clarity"

Due to this I subbed to this subreddit a few months back to see any issues or positive stories. I know people will generally post when they are frustrated rather when they are happy which is why I want to ask some questions. - is the camera the only thing about Google phones that stands out? - is the overheating an issue when gaming (clash of clans, watcher of realms etc) or just in generalThe features I love with Samsung (and this may be available on pixel as well) is the ability to snap 2 apps on the screen at the same time (half and half) so I can game on one and check reddit on the other etcI have some hearing loss so the ability to set up headphones based on the hearing test is excellent is this available on pixel? The battery life doesn't bother me as Samsung flip so bad with this I know it will be an improvement as will the screen.

Right now I'm just trying to create a little graph overlay on top of a pre-existing image in my (oh right we don't even have a gallery app..) Google photos app and Google gallery app. No option?! This reminds me of just yesterday when my girlfriend is yelling at me to lower the flashlight brightness. After fumbling around for 5 minutes it turns out you can't.No option to make the washed out cold display warmer (the ""app for that"" is killing my battery).She said ""there's probably an app for all that"".God, that phrase brought me back a decade 😲Luckily after googling around for 10 minutes I was able to find out how to make a scrolling screenshot just before giving up. Damn, they really don't want people finding that one out. Due to the layout on the pixel 9 pro fold it's absolutely impossible to do it one handed(folded of course) so I've gotten used to doing it from the recent apps screen. Guess what? It only shows up by doing it from the hardware buttons! Even though it's the exact same action, a screenshot. Very Google? Very odd. Additional inconveniences - Wifi auto on feature, but no auto off??- Icons stuck in a circle shape- No option to lower keyboard haptic feedback - Globe icon in navigation bar and also keyboard, redundancy - Quick toggle text/ names are scrolling constantly, font too large?- Build number displaying in notification panel, not stable software?I won't say which phone company I previously used to keep this unbiased, but I'll just say it was super convenient not needing third party apps for basic functionality. I really want my Pixel 9 Pro Fold to work well. Hardware is bang on. Updates alone could fix everything. But will they actually come? "

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience+Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"

I believe he and the FedEx driver were in it together. The driver posted the picture of the package next to the garage door as a proof of delivery. My house door is just 5 steps away from the garage and the driver could've placed the package in front of my door but he put it in the driveway deliberately. I'm relieved since I got my package but this is so unprofessional on FedEx and Google's part as I clearly check the option of ""Signature Required"" which was ignored by FedEx."

No matter how much I convince myself that the iPhone hardware is good enough to warrant a switch, I can't come to terms with leaving Pixel Software.The right amount of customization, Material You, aesthetically pleasing design and pixel thoughtful features are my hooks.And the thought of having to deal with iOS restrictions, worse notifications, worse keyboard and the  lack of customization that I see on my ipad keeps me away from switchingDo you guys feel the same?"
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality']","What’s the Pixel experience like? Thinking about switching to a Pixel 9 Pro from an iPhone 12+Hi!I’ve been following the launch of the Pixel 9 as I’ve always been into the smartphone world and I was quite surprised with how it came out.I always had a Samsung phone (S8 > S9+ > S20 Plus) and I grew up so tired of Samsung that I entirely left the Android ecosystem. I couldn’t stand the Exynos CPU, battery life, constant overheating and the bloatware-full software that the One UI experience was then.Then I switched to an iPhone 12 in 2021 and everything has gone flawless until late 2023, where I was starting to get frequent overheating and low battery performance. I replaced the battery (it was at 80% health) and I could notice an improvement but it felt quite the same. I really liked that everything on iOS just worked and you don’t have to tweak every single thing down to the last bit in order to get a great experience, that last thing just never happened with the Samsung phones that I owned. But I’m quite bored of the OS and lack of customization and innovation that Apple offers.Now I’m looking to upgrade my phone, as I managed to break the image stabilization of the main camera sensor (image is always out of focus) and the internet modem doesn’t work out of my country as i’m currently on vacation and I’m stuck using 2G for 14 days for no apparent reason  (yes, I could prove it was a hardware/phone related issue).I value the smoothness of the software, battery and cameras the most, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL manages to hit the sweet spot of all three while having a clean Software experience, but I want to know what has been your experience with Pixels as I’ve never owned one and how well do they age? Have you had any of that buggy Pixel experiences that many people talk about?I’m also waiting for what the iPhone 16 Pro has to offer, but I’m quite sold on the Pixel already. Thank you for reading this."
negative,"[' ""Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, User Experience""']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6.   Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt.

As of this post, it’s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM — and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It’s a small touch, but a cool one — and I had no idea it even existed.

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."

I mean they even used to include headphones and now they don't. I liked it when they included that stuff. It felt like you could truly enjoy the phone with all these little presents. You felt like you were a valued customer and the price didn't feel as bad. As someone who's been buying from Google since the first pixel in 2016 I feel a bit betrayed I guess? I've watched this happen over the years, the prices are going up but items we typically got in the box are no longer included. This is how you treat customers who have been purchasing from you for years? Soon they'll be okay with not including the USB cord as well. This is how it starts they take little by little, they ease you into it, then they keep taking more. You barely notice until one day everything is sold separately for triple the price.This is just my opinion but I really wish it came with the charging port because I like using the brand seamlessly.  I've already been experiencing charging issues whenever I buy a different brand of charger. I'm at the point where I'm basically wiggling to get my current Google phone to charge. Well if I'm being honest my old Google charger has blown as well. However I don't know if it's because I changed the cord when the old one wore out or maybe the brand quality has gone down in the years. So I really don't want to spend $30 for another when I'm already buying a new phone for $300 more than I paid a few years ago. It's ridiculous that I have to pay any extra for something that should be included in the first place. So anyway, what's the reason for not including the port? Capitalism and greed?"
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical (voice), Bluetooth']","Moved from Pixel 8pro to S25U+For anyone who is considering moving. I hope this helps. I recently switched from the Pixel 8 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and here are my observations:Display: The S25 Ultra's display is noticeably better in terms of brightness and the anti-reflective coating. It performs exceptionally well under various lighting conditions.Speakers: The speakers on the S25 Ultra are significantly louder than those on the Pixel 8 Pro. Initially, I thought the Pixel had great audio, but this upgrade proved me wrong.Performance & Battery: The S25 Ultra outperforms the Pixel 8 Pro in both performance and battery life. As a heavy user who frequently takes pictures and watches videos, I no longer have to worry about running out of charge while out and about—something I often wished was better on the Pixel.S Pen: This is my first phone with a stylus, so I don’t really miss the Bluetooth functionality that was removed. I’m still getting used to it, but it’s a nice addition.Design: I wasn’t a fan of the sharp corners on previous Samsung Ultra models, so I appreciate the rounded edges on this one. However, I still prefer the Pixel 8 Pro's Bay Blue color over the Jade Green I ordered for the S25 Ultra. While the Samsung looks premium, the Pixel had a cooler aesthetic in my opinion.Camera: This is where I have mixed feelings. The S25 Ultra excels in video recording, but for photography, I’ve noticed some noise in darker areas—something the Pixel handled much better. Knowing how powerful Google's image processing is, I’ll likely install a GCam port to see if that improves the results.Haptics: The haptic feedback on the Pixel is far better than on the S25 Ultra. It feels much more precise, especially when typing with Gboard or other keyboards. I’m also disappointed that Samsung still doesn’t support face recognition for CTS-certified apps like banking applications.Signal Reception: The S25 Ultra has better signal reception than the Pixel 8 Pro, thanks to the Snapdragon processor.Final Thoughts: Overall, this has been a solid upgrade, especially considering the trade-in value. With promotional offers, I got around $750 for my year-old Pixel 8 Pro, while its actual trade-in value was closer to $350. The improvements in display, battery life, and performance make it worth it, but I do miss some of the Pixel’s strengths—especially in photography and haptics."

Out of the box the phone doesn't turn on. I chatted with 2 specialists on their site to troubleshoot and they weren't able to resolve it and asked me to start a return. When i attempted to start the return they declined it with no given reason. I have warranty on it until April 03 2025. what am I able to do?  Edit: Here is a response email from them.  https://imgur.com/a/DtZNWx2  Edit2: i been told there's no way to override the system even if it's within 14 days of my purchase. They provide a battery replacement with a third party tech that's about 14KM away but I believe I'll be doing a charge back at this point. Edit3: The phone works after squeezing all it's corners. I'm still attempting to return this phone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmxxAY7TcbsEdit4: They escalated the situation but I'm told the manger doesn't have any more tools than the support agent. The manager also takes 24-48 hours to respond via email. I'm afraid they will drag this on past the 14 day return.https://imgur.com/a/lcamjKOSidenote: Amazon has listed the phone for cheaper at $780 CAD and fido offers it for $2 on top of your phone plane for 12 months = to $48 for a pixel 8 pro.
negative,"[' User Experience, Other']","Pixel 9 Pro FINALLY feels like a premium build quality.+I've had dozens of Nexus/Pixel devices over the years and this is the first device that truly feels like it has a premium build quality. I'm upgrading from the Pixel 7 and it's just a lot of little things that add up to a better feel:- Uniform borders around the screen. It seems like a dumb little thing, but that black bar at the bottom really screamed cheap to me. - No jagged edges and small gaps where panels meet. On the Pixel 7 everywhere there is a change in direction/material there is a sharp edge and a small gap your fingernail can catch on. The Pixel 9 Pro is nearly seamless and feels like solid block that is comfortable to hold. - The USB port is a perfect fit for cables and they click in for a perfect fit. The Pixel 7 has a slightly oversized port and cables always felt loose (even when secured fully.)"

Do not underestimate Google's ability to produce a phone of equal quality to Samsung or Qualcomm chips. Samsung is essentially riding on the coattails of Qualcomm's prowess, while Google is producing software and AI-enhanced hardware. In reality, Samsung is not on par with Google in terms of AI technology. These are just my two cents, but I found this article to be a compelling read that aligns with my thoughts 🙋🏽‍♂️😎🙋🏽‍♂️😎"

There is no summarise feature for pixels.There is no Google duplex or call for me features.There is no updated call screening I'm sure I'm missing plenty more, and let's not forget it took 3-5 years for UK users to get the hold for me and direct my call features, so who knows how long until we see the above. It's just weird that these phones are sold on many of the above features but are not available to UK users. There doesn't even seem to be an obvious disclaimer. I feel like people need to avoid pixels until Google gets the picture that they can't keep advertising phones on features that are not available to many, many people. It's only going to get worse with this year's Google I/O.**EDIT**From the comments it appears this problem is more widespread than just the UK. It seems the US are getting what they pay for, whilst the rest of us are getting severely cutback versions of the same phone and paying the same price."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience']","Husband just got a strange ‘spoken’ message on his Google Pixel 6?!?+UPDATE: I’m overwhelmed by so many great responses/empathetic stories - thank you all so much ❣️ Please read my ETA’s for answers to questions several have asked…=========================So, a few minutes ago (~10:30pm Central time), my husband was asleep - and his phone, as usual, was in Sleep mode with Do Not Disturb automatically turned on - when he was woken from a sound sleep with his phone speaking some kind of message about Trump (he wasn’t sure - he was just asleep! - if it was a pro or anti-Trump message).  He then checked his phone and there was NO open app or recent notification.Before anyone asks if “he was dreaming”, he walked out to the living room to tell me about it and I could hear his phone from the bedroom speaking some OTHER message (we couldn’t hear it from there exactly what the message said).Not sure if it’s connected, but his phone recently updated to Android 15.  So, WTF is this !!??!ETA: also, several people has asked, and, no, he doesn’t use Google Assistant…Please see my last ETA about the Assistant history…ETA:  the big puzzle is what could break through DND?  A quick Google shows no apparent log (that I could find) that the DND keeps if it’s interrupted?ETA:  We also have an Echo Spot in the bedroom, but Activity History on the device doesn’t show any activity at the time this happened…?ETA: I’m adding this part to answer several similar questions….I’ve said in several replies (and I’m truly sorry that I haven’t more promptly replied to all the 160+ comments which my question prompted, and I thank all of you for each one!) that we both do not Intentionally use Google Assistant.    Since we don’t intentionally use it, I wouldn’t have known until someone suggested to look at Google Assistant history.  So, after researching how to do that, I just now searched his Google Assistant history —- and it does not show ANY activity at all last night - Oct 28 - at around 10:30 pm.   There is an entry that only said “Used Assistant” on Oct 27 at 6:10pm.  There is also an entry for today - Oct 29 -  saying the same “Used Assistant” at 12:14pm.  No other details other than that.  However, there is no entry for Oct 28 at all, let alone for 10:30 pm.  Since we don’t intentionally use Google Assistant (by intentional, I mean by saying Hey Google), I was surprised to see ANYthing in the history.  But those are the entries I found, and (even though I don’t know what triggered those entries) I have no idea what “Used Assistant” without any further details even means, but I don’t believe it indicates that Google Assistant was the culprit.Hopefully this might encourage people to stop downvoting me?  Because I really don’t understand why the downvotes.  But, this is Reddit, so I accept that happens.  "

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. /rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken. Yes we could still support an iPhone 6, but have you tried using one? It's so slow you can't really use it. Forced obsolescence is what pisses me off. Yes, I knew it from the beginning.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."

negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues']","Google Photos extremely slow to load photos (Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold)+I just switched to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold from an iPhone 14 Pro. I'm really enjoying the phone so far but one thing I havent been able to get over is how EXTREMELY slow photos and videos are to load in Google Photos just when scrolling through the photos app. When I tap on a photo to open one, it is grey for around 2-5 seconds and then a low res photo appears and then another 2-5 seconds for the full res photo to finally load. Not only this, but the phone heats up signficantly when just scrolling through the photos app and uses up a lot of the battery. The photos are all on the local device and the app is saying that it also has finished backing up all the photos to the cloud.     I found that it isn't just in Google Photos too. I installed the Google Gallery app and although it is significantly better than Google Photos in terms of speed, it still takes a second or two to load the photos. The same thing happens on airplane mode without a connection and with a fast internet connection. I have tried restarting the phone, and uninstalling update, re-updating it through the play store and restarting the phone, but the issue still happens. I have also noticed that when going to find videos in the videos folder in Google Photos, when i scroll to the bottom, it shows the correct date (e.g. 2013) but with the wrong videos. This is the case for a lot of the videos. Instead they are showing a duplicate of a newer video and when I open it, it brings me to that new video. And when exiting out of that video, it brings me to the new date (2024). It's as if the app knows that the video is the one from 2024 but its showing them under 2013. There are 20+ videos like this. However, the videos are correct in the general photos tab when I scroll down. I believe the issue is to do with Google Photos not having finished processing all the photos, and still doing it in the background, making the phone overheat and lag when scrolling and viewing photos. However, I see no progress bar or how to force those updates. I also theorise it might have to do with the iPhone photo formats? If anyone else who switched from iPhone to Pixel have noticed the same issues, what did you do to fix it? It is such a deal breaker when the big screen is so good for viewing photos, but the experience with the app is so poor.(I transfered around 7000 photos+videos from my iPhone and uploaded them all over the span of the first 2 days of having the Pixel.)"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Is Google aware of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold magnetic mount problem?+Many people attach metal panels or buy special cases to allow their phone to mount inside of their car using magnets. Magsafe is one example, though generic mounts with metal plates exist as well. They make docking and undocking your phone in the car for handsfree navigation much easier.However, the Pixel 9 pro fold seems to have an absolutely terrible design flaw: Attaching the phone to a magnetic mount makes the phone unusable.That sounds a bit of an overreaction, but I've tried 3 different brand and types of magnet mounts so far and they all have the same problem. Once attached, the phone screen will flicker on and off rapidly, not allowing you to do anything whatsoever to the phone until it's taken off.Is Google aware of this? Is this something that's going to be fixed? I'm still in my 30 day return window, but it's rapidly closing. While I love the phone otherwise- I do a lot of driving for my job and this basically makes the phone a liability for even trying to navigate with it.What options do I have? I don't want to return it, but I've heard others with the same problem say that Google is 'aware', but if it's never going to be fixed then I can't stick with the phone."

negative,"[' audio, technical, tech, video, display, user experience, experience, service, support, help']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6.   Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any.

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. /rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken. Yes we could still support an iPhone 6, but have you tried using one? It's so slow you can't really use it. Forced obsolescence is what pisses me off. Yes, I knew it from the beginning.

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown: \*\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app) # 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on. # 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files # 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers. # 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet. # 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!) # 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons. # 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows. # 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\*\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."

At 2x and beyond, it looks worse than 12 MP.### 4.9x - 30xStandard telephoto.# ConclusionFor best resolution and quality in daylight and for still objects:### 0.5x - 0.9xUse 50 MP *only* under very good lighting conditions and with a tripod, otherwise use 12 MP.### 1x - 1.9xUse 50 MP.## 2x - 4.9xUse 12 MP.### 5x - 7xUse 50 MP.### 7x - 30xUse 12 MP.## Caveats ### MotionWhen the subject is in motion, always use 12 MP.### Low lightEven for night shots, under my extensive testing, the 12 MP will typically do better at all zoom ranges in preserving details in the shadows. This isn't always the case though. If you use Night Sight with decent lighting and can max out the slider on shutter speed, then you will get a good/better image with 50 MP.### Top shotYou don't get this with 50 MP.### Final wordI spent many hours on this. I did very extensive pixel peeping, zooming in and cropping to obscene levels after the photos were taken. These things won't be visible on a normal viewing on a phone screen.### Images[Here is the album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOSr_o7Gg4UysWyBi0fQMhfpSEmF9e-SaDKS_gRA6VGb_EzmKXSRKWTpRk_qLPQqg?key=MHRuam84R2F0dDN5ZFREclMxbUtMYnVndC1xVU9n) of photos that I took to analyze.Note: I've added direct notes to each image which explains what that image is. Each image is labeled.BTW [here's](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO9BvRD6Z9XWkAe-QFGhTNhNKKDrhUQhVHZ-ZI1FmQQlmgKBn8WzMiB8Z1Tq70hag?key=aGdzbjhVdnZYTTJyMmc0aVRBOHRuSmg2MHhoaXl3) the one I did two years ago with the Pixel 7.You'll notice that the place where the telephoto shot is fused in is much more obvious. It seems Google has done a better job this year blending the two different images.EDIT: So apparently it's a 4.85x telephoto and not 5x. I've updated my testing to reflect this. However, I'm not changing the numbers because it's too close to 5x and sometimes the lens won't switch anyway because the phone will prefer the main sensor in non-perfect lighting, plus the quick tap number is 5x."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","The things I like about Android+Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."
negative,"[' User Experience, Others']","It's just too damn expensive.+Look, the Pixel 9 is an amazing phone. Probably the best I've ever tried. But 899 in Europe is just too much money for what it does, especially if you compare it to its immediate predecessors. I get the ""new"" feeling, I get that it's a flagship, but last year's flagships are half the price and the price/quality tradeoff was better when they launched anyways.If you're on the fence, I'd say either wait or go for the 8 series, you ain't missing anything worth the tag."
negative,"[' Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.+Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.""PPS: up to 11V/3A, 16V/3A, 21V/2.25A max 45W""Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6.   Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, ""Hey Google"".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical']","I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy+What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I’ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I’ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I’ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don’t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, “Yep, that looks about like what I expected.” Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that “new device feel,” so I’m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, “Well, what now?” moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I’m talking about. There’s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I’m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn’t do a very deep dive and I’m out of the store now, so I’m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I’ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any.

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https://i.imgur.com/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words ""Wired Keyboard."" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https://i.imgur.com/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https://i.imgur.com/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https://i.imgur.com/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https://i.imgur.com/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."

This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. /rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

I was just wondering if I made a mistake or not. I got a really good deal. The phone and pixel watch 3 (45mm) for about 1050 including my pixel 6a trade. Just wanted to know what people thought. Thanks!

Never overheat, it was just a well working device overall.My experience with 8:- Selfie camera: during the first month of use, the selfie camera quality was horrible, it got fixed after a month or so, still in non-perfect light condition the quality is really not great. *""but you don't buy a pixel phone for the selfie camera!""**-* Battery: Not even 1 year and already I can see it lasting less and less, on busy days I'm so worried that I use the phone on ""Battery saving"" mode, otherwise it wouldn't last the full day. And I keep the screen always at lower brightness than I would like.- Overheating: It's true that we are experiencing hotter summer than ever, but when outside the camera app makes it overheat SO quickly. I've had the device turning off for overheat while I was taking a video(and I was inside a house)...now I just ""let it rest"" for a few minutes when I feel it is overheating.- Modem: always been crappy, especially for people travelling in different regions of the world, the pixel is not the device to own. Happy that they've given up and the Pixel 9 modem will be Samsung made.- Software-based locked/removed features just to make the Pixel 8 Pro more enticing (as if the Pixel 8 is a cheap entry model ).I don't know how to evaluate new devices anymore, every time a new device comes out it seems like the perfect device with incredible reviews, but the reality is that I had a better experience on my Pixel 5."

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone+As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown: \*\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app) # 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on. # 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It’s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It’s better cleaning of cluttering files # 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it’s older feature, so It’s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I’m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers. # 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet. # 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!) # 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it’s on chrome browser on windows. It’s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons. # 8. App Availability* I don’t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows. # 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\*\* I hope  it’s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."
negative,"[' Audio, Bluetooth, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality']","Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience+Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."

It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See 😀above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."
negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Pixel 9 Pro, from an iPhone user+I would regard myself as a tech guy. My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I've previously taken. - Problems I've had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as ""gimmicky"", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I've been wanting to try more foods, so I'll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it'll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It'll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used ""Add me"" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there's finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I've had the buds 3 for about a week and they've been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you're on the fence on switching - I'd suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you're worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I've had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds. Full ecosystem! If you have any questions about the switch, let me know! "
negative,"[' User Experience, Others']","Switching from iPhone 15 Pro Max to Pixel 9 Pro XL: A Delightful Upgrade+I recently made the switch from the iPhone 15 Pro Max to the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The camera on the Pixel 9 Pro XL is simply outstanding. It consistently delivers sharper, more vibrant photos, and the AI enhancements make every shot look professional.Beyond the camera, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is incredibly fun to use. The interface is smooth and intuitive, and the integration of Google's smart features adds a layer of convenience that I didn't realize I was missing. Overall, the switch has been a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the Pixel 9 Pro XL to anyone looking for a superior camera and a more enjoyable smartphone experience."
negative,"[' Audio Issues: None, Video Issues: None, User Experience: experience, service, support, others, Technical: tech, Voice Quality: voice, Bluetooth: bluetooth, WiFi: wireless, Call drop: call drop']","Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far+I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [""On paper""](https://i.imgur.com/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https://i.imgur.com/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro / 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https://i.postimg.cc/MxzkX26p/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https://i.postimg.cc/ZZHGd7nF/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https://i.postimg.cc/Pt9wMz4w/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of ""I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)"". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https://i.postimg.cc/KmFCHT59/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that ""radiation"" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https://i.postimg.cc/fDY6CCYt/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https://postimg.cc/gallery/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https://imgur.com/a/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https://youtu.be/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more ""punch"". It ""hits"" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more ""internal"" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https://i.postimg.cc/rcYKkWBq/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https://i.postimg.cc/1Pzf2MYW/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a ""SIM not supported"" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the ""Class C 1.8V"" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the ""SIM not supported"" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8"" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5"" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https://i.postimg.cc/jj3QfQfX/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https://postimg.cc/gallery/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https://postimg.cc/gallery/wyPM7qG).

negative,"[' Service, User Experience, Others']","The Satellite SOS feature is a big deal! (Even if it's stolen from Apple)+I don't see anyone else talking about this specific feature, but for me it was the main reason I've pre-ordered a 9 pro. Apple's implementation of it was the only thing that has made me consider an iPhone in years. I'm an outdoorsman and work as a wildlife biologist, so a large portion of my time is spent out in remote areas with little or no cell reception, and this feature could literally save my life. The only competition for this feature (which is free on pixels btw,) are devices like the Garmin InReach or SPOT, which cost $100 on the low end and up to $500 on the high end, while also requiring a subscription ranging from $15-$70 a month. Now yes, if you're out of service for an extended period of time these devices will still have some advantages, but having this functionality built into the device you already carry daily, for free, is going to be monumental for people's safety in remote areas. This will save lives "

negative,"[' Audio, Sound, Video, Display, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","The things I like about Android+Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."

negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues, Technical']","My experience with Pixel 9 Pro XL +I've been using the Pixel 9 Pro XL since October, and here are some of my observations, experiences, and disappointments. I was previously an iPhone user (from the iPhone 8 Plus to the 14 Pro Max), but before my first iPhone, I had a Galaxy Note 5, so I know how using an Android phone is. I returned to Android with the Pixel 9 Pro because of its advertised AI features, and because I wanted more customization options.  It's been a bit jarring to realize that Android still isn't as smooth and polished as iOS.While Android offers many software features I love, such as Gemini, instant Google search, and text selection from the home bar—things I wish Apple would integrate—the app optimization is baffling!  Apps often look better and function more smoothly on iOS. For example, WhatsApp's UI is far superior on Apple, and the scrolling through apps and web pages are smooth like butter on iOS compared to Android.Another frustration is third-party launchers. I expected them to work seamlessly, but the phone glitches every time I try to return to the home screen. The default Pixel Launcher works perfectly, but I really want to customize my home screen without these annoyances!And to add to the list of my frustrations, I find Google photos to be lacking a lot in terms of navigation through media compared to iOS.I know, I could just ditch this phone and go back to an iPhone, but I won't. I am in the looks for solutions since I'll be stuck with this phone for years and I like to tinker around.Any way, that's my rant. If anyone have any suggestions feel free to comment.Btw, Merry Christmas to everyone! "

That resulted in icons within the status (notification) bar being misaligned with the camera cutout. And that was the reason for numerous complaints after the models launched. In the December update, Google addressed those complaints by making the whole status bar much thicker. Which means that usable screen estate for all (non-full screen) apps running on Pixel 9s substantially decreased. … All. the. time!Comparison photos (Pixel 9, Pixel 8, Samsung)  [https://imgur.com/a/wvpciKB](https://imgur.com/a/wvpciKB)What the…! So, vendors promote every tenth of millimeter of reduced screen bezel on new devices, it is even one of the main differentiator between Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, but someone in the Google came up with this shitty solution to degrade usable screen estate of the phones? The devices, which are already in the market? How is this not style over function!I couldn’t care less about misaligned icons with the camera cut out, but I understand that somebody was annoyed by this. But I have a ""Pro"" phone and this solution is really not ok for me. For me the value of my Pixel 9 Pro decreased with this change. Wasn’t possible to just align icons without moving the bottom border of the status bar? I know, the padding on top and the bottom would not match then… How do you feel about this? Are you happy with the change? Or is there some customization allowing to partially revert this? By this post I want to raise awareness and maybe motivate a few more users to send feedback to Google about this. You can do so via Settings > About phone > Send feedback about this device. ----------EDIT: BTW I just realized how half baked this change is. Just look at the first picture with notification screen. There, the icons are kept misaligned with the cut-out while remaining screen area was moved lower... Particularly with this screen I previously thought (before the update), how they perfectly balanced UX with the cutout, as the space given by round borders between top system toggles gives enough space from the cutout without jeopardizing screen estate. (Plus this UX has always black background, so the camera itself blends in). Google has for sure some tweaking to go. The question is which way. "

While those posts are important and helped me learn a great deal on how to properly protect myself (checking the return box if trade in value isn't as expected or videoing the entire packaging process) these posts also made me extremely nervous. When all you see is horror stories you tend to think that's all that happens. My hope is that my experience will encourage others and offset the fears that someone could have from reading the sub. ====* **November 15th** - I ordered my Pixel 9 Pro through the Google Store. Thanks to this community I learned about the 30% off coupon from the Google Play Store. I tend to gift A LOT of subs to people I watch on Twitch. Because of this, I was a gold member on the play store without even realizing it. I was able to apply the coupon and Google evaluated my Pixel 6 Pro as being worth $425 dollars. Due to them saying the value could go down, I check the ""return phone to me if phone trade in value decreases"" box. * **November 18th** - I receive my package a day earlier than I expected from FedEx. There wasn't anyone home so the driver left my package on my front door. FedEx showed me a picture of the person who was responsible for delivering my package. I verified via my security camera that this was the same person and they didn't take the package after photographing it. It sits at my front door till a family member comes home and puts it inside. My new phone is inside with the trade in packaging. * **November 18th** (same night) - I record myself putting the old phone into the trade in box. I follow all the instructions to the letter. I factory reset my phone, clean it (more of a personal preference honestly), package it, and use all the security seals to seal it. This is done on camera in one continuous video. * **November 19th** - I drop it off at my local UPS and they give me a drop off receipt which I retain. * **November 21st** - I verify that the Pixel 6 Pro I sent has been received by the Juliet, TN facility via UPS's tracking number.* **November 24th** - I receive an email from Google verifying they received my trade in and they were going to offer me $450 for my trade in (+$25 more).

negative,"[' Video Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Tried Pixel 9; it is smooth, much smoother than Pixel 8+There are those who notice stutter, and then there are those for whom the Pixel 8 is perfectly smooth. I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that ""120Hz smoothness"" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8's UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the ""Pro"" models. In conclusion, if you were concerned with the stuttering, I am happy to report, there is no issue with it. I only tried one unit so far, but it was much, much better than Pixel 8."

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up. (Now if only we could adopt longer battery life to smart watches ::cough:: pixel watch ::cough::)Edit 4 - ended my day of normal-high usage at 25%. Woke up with it at 6:45 AM and laying down in bed with it now at 11:30 PM. ## Performance I don't really game much on my phone but it played Pokemon Go very easily.## Gemini vs Google Assistant? It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. 😂The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro. New phone has me with new lingo already Edit 5 - reworded the Gemini and Google Assistant section to make more sense. "

The phone gets warm really quick, from relatively minimal use. Charging speeds are _a snail's pace_ unless I turn the phone fully off (I'm assuming thermal throttling).This is my second Pixel 8, after buying one used and having the same experience.

Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Here are the results.+*\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1*** **July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2*** **July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3*** **July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4*** **July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\*Conclusion\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","I just put a PebbleBee and an Apple Air Tracker in a box and am mailing it to a family member a few states away to test the Android Find My Device capabilities.+I did a local test around town today to see if our nely arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens. *Update 1* July 3rdAfter the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.*Update 2* July 4As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.*Update 3* July 5I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.*Update 4*  July 6The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.*Conclusion*It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

(Best file transfer app)+Hey everyone, while learning about Apple and Android ecosystems, I've noticed a lot of people talking about AirDrop as if it's some kind of magical feature, or how amazing it is to use a Windows computer with a Samsung phone. Well, let me tell you: Good morning! I've been using Linux for at least 6 years now and my Pixel 4 (which, according to a friend, is faster than a 14 Max) for almost 5.KDE Connect is an application developed for the KDE Desktop Environment on Linux, but it works on any Linux distribution, even with GNOME (in fact, it's almost better integrated). It also has a respective app for Android (I don't know about iOS but I don't think so).You can do everything with it: control your PC in real time, using the keyboard, scrolling, mouse input with a double tap to click, etc., send files using your home Wi-Fi very easily (from PC: right-click -> send to device *name*, from phone: share -> KDE conn. -> send to *name*), execute any terminal command from your phone, which allows you to do whatever you want with your phone (I use it to lock my PC, turn it off), and you'll also have simultaneous notifications, a shared clipboard (both incoming and outgoing or as you prefer) and a lot of other really cool things that I invite you to try.I wanted to tell you about this because big companies are selling what a group of developers created a few years ago, and they did it better and for free.Download KDE Connect and you'll see that's all you need to have an ecosystem between devices, so much so that even my Apple fan friends were speechless."

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "

negative,"[' User Experience, Audio, Video, Technical, Other']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical, Service, Support, Others, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions+I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https://oukitel.com/products/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the ""Force full GNSS measurements"" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus+In case it matters, I'm in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided ""No Samsung"" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's ""Smart Panel"" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

However when I did this, my SIM card was no longer being read. I am on Three UK and the anywhere in the settings where the SIM card was mentioned or network was mentioned was greyed out. I tried a bunch of solutions.This included:- Restarting the device multiple times- Resetting the network settings- Turning the device off for the day (I thought it might have been an overheating issue)Nothing worked, so I decided to flash the device with Googles browser flashing service. I tried the other latest build, AP2A.240605.024.A1, but I had the same issue. I almost gave up but then I thought to try the previous Android14 build that was on the 8 Pro, AP1A.240505.005.B1. This worked! I can use my network again on my Pixel 8 Pro. I will raise this as a bug with Android. I thought to post here also just in case other people were having the same issue. All the best."

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi']","Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early.

negative,"[' User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Call drop, Bluetooth, WiFi']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "
negative,"[' User Experience, Technical, Video Issues, Others']","Android should really change how it works+As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn’t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting—the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument."
negative,"[' Audio Issues: audio, sound\n   User Experience: experience, user\n   Technical: tech, other (UWB)\n   Service: service, support (FW updates)']","Moto Tag vs Chipolo One Point initial comparison+Just received my FMD Moto tags and thought I'd share my initial observations.Moto Tag* Looks and feels slightly better quality, and certainly a much better colour choice.* Quite a bit smaller than the Chipolo (although a similar size in the case I chose).* Ability to adjust the ring volume of the tag within the Google FMD app (although high volume sounds quite a bit quieter then the Chipolo).* Has it's own companion app and the ability to update the FW of the tag. You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Voice Quality, Call drop, Bluetooth, WiFi']","ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro - Buyer Beware+Let me know if this needs to go elsewhere, but after doing quite a bit of searching here and across the web, there aren't many places to actually leave reviews for this device, including ASUS' own site. I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Bluetooth']","Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25+Alongside updates to [Gemini](https://www.androidfaithful.com/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/) and [Circle to Search](https://www.androidfaithful.com/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https://www.resound.com/en-us/) and [Oticon Intent](https://www.oticon.com/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."

Whatever corners are cut to keep pricing competitive also affect it. On top of it, smartphone reviewers don't usually talk much about longevity of the phone model.  So, for someone getting a phone for long term usage, what are the things to look out for. It makes sense that flagships usually last longer due to better materials, more care and longer software support, but these things apply to mid-range as well as low-range phone.  I am listing some things that I can think of. Please add on to this list, and let me know if I added something wrong.  1. Overheating issues - Phones that run hot are bound to damage its internal components faster, so should check that it should not have overheating problems. Also, maybe not use phone while charging?2. Ingress Protection - Accidents are likely to happen over years of usage, some amount of water/dust protection helps.3. Software support - Security updates and bug fixes are crucial although Android updates would be a plus. Can someone list out the brands which have better software support right now (quick bug fixes, security patches)4. Planned Obsolescence from brands - Do Android brands push updates to their older phones to make it less usable? Can someone comment on this, is it legit or conspiracy.5. Chipset and RAM - Probably consider at least a mid-range chipset (someone in the comments can suggest what's the minimum to go for?) and higher RAM variant.6. Battery Protection - Battery will degrade over-time, nothing can prevent that. But some brands have battery protection features built into their software, you should look for those and keep them on.7.  Custom ROM Support - Custom ROMs can extend the life of a device by years past its software support. Should consider a Qualcomm chipset if you're up for it. Are there other things that affect Custom ROM support except chip, like do some brands make it easier to flash a custom ROM, can someone suggest in comments?8. Build issues -  Usually phones these days don't have major design flaws, just something to keep in mind. Also, can someone comment on foldables, I know that at least Samsung has improved a lot on its foldable design but is it reached to a point that its comparable to bar phones, both display and hinge.9. Display issues - Check up if that particular device has display issues from other users online.10. Recent connectivity standards - For now, maybe look for 5G, but in general the newer Bluetooth/WiFi/Mobile standard, the better.11. Service Centers - Claim extended warranty if available, and check to make sure you have service centers within comfortable distance near you."

But the wooden back looks amazing! And it's very light.The screen curve is a bit too much for me, much curvier than on the pixel, but you get used to it.The case that comes with it is ok, doesn't cover the sides of the phone and it is a bit slippery.The fingerprint reader is optical, I would say on par with the Pixel 7 Pro.I've noticed a few stutters here and there, but had the first update yesterday and this seems to have helped with that a little!As for the camera, I was actually kinda impressed with it but at the same time there are some issues. The amount of details you can get in a picture can be impressive, but it tends to either overexpose or underexpose the shots. The colours are a bit oversaturated sometimes as well.The camera issues will hopefully be fixed with updates! Here's a link to some pictures I took, unsure if they got compressed by imgur https://imgur.com/a/Ip6J1ClI am not a mobile gamer so didn't try any games.

This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided ""No Samsung"" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's ""Smart Panel"" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."

negative,"[' User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Others']","Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1299.99 for the 256GB storage model.The Galaxy S25 series is available for pre-order starting today, and will be released for general availability on February 7.## Galaxy S25 series full specs| Spec                    | Galaxy S25                                                                                                        | Galaxy S25+                                                                                                                    | Galaxy S25 Ultra                                                                                                                                                   || :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || Colors                  | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                             | Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver                                                                                                     || Screen                  | 6.2"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                | 6.7"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                          | 6.9"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                                                                 || Main Camera -

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media.

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."
negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues, Audio Issues, Technical']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"

The post does not explicitly mention any audio, video, service, support, voice quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, or call drop issues.']","What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?+I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in ""flagship"" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the ""old"" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the ""normal"" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \*trying\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have ""extra space"" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a ""flagship"" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a ""flagship"" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for ""security concerns"" (which are valid, except that these ""security concerns"" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN/password is entered, the orientation/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often/with what parameters you need to use a PIN/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification/utility panel), navigation bars, ""recent apps"" screens, or other integral UI/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called ""navbar"") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification/utility panel) (the app I use is called ""oneshade"") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \*mostly\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \*can\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a ""flagship"" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with ""flagship"" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a ""flagship"" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the ""solution"" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory ""capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first"" to the theory of ""this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things"" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","What I miss as a new Pixel user - Any suggestions?+I am new to Pixel and recently got a new Pixel 8a, and generally, I love it. It's extremely smooth and fast in comparison to my aging Oppo A91. However, there are a couple of features that I wish Google could bring from their rivals:1. **Floating windows.** This is perhaps, the feature that I miss the most. I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting the screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly, you have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on/off the device.** This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega/giga bytes consumed per day.** I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.** This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app? I sometimes get several notifications from Duolingo, but they are always split. I wish I could have all of them coming from one app in one place instead of several.Thanks for any comments or suggestions if you have any."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Others, Technical']","Little quality of life stuffs are pushing me towards Android+I am deeply invested into the Apple Ecosystem and have an iphone 12 mini, macbook air etc. I really like my mini but there are some quirks I have had to deal with that I didn't like i.e. when trying to gather info from one app to other I always have to look and switch instead of having it split screen. I got a Unihertz Titan pocket recently as part of my ""dumb smartphone"" experiment and I am starting to grow to love it. Some little things it does which are not possible/difficult in ios* Recording Whatsapp video calls along with audio - In IOS, due to meta restrictions I think, only the video part is recorded and never the audio. This frustrates me as I frequently video call with my little niece and want to record all the video calls. * Minimalistic launchers - Again part of my ""digital detox"" strategy. I love the fact that you simply install a new launcher and can make it so minimalistic that it turns you off from picking up the phone and doom scrolling* Split screen - Although it's kinda unusable on such a small screen on my android phone, it's nice to know that if I ever switch to a larger screen android, I have this wonderful option"
negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here's everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1299.99 for the 256GB storage model.The Galaxy S25 series is available for pre-order starting today, and will be released for general availability on February 7.## Galaxy S25 series full specs| Spec                    | Galaxy S25                                                                                                        | Galaxy S25+                                                                                                                    | Galaxy S25 Ultra                                                                                                                                                   || :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || Colors                  | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                | Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow                                                                                             | Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, Titan Whitesilver                                                                                                     || Screen                  | 6.2"" FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                | 6.7"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                          | 6.9"" QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Display<br>120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate                                                                                                 || Main Camera -

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical, Call drop']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

Real life problems when moving to android there is no solution for. +Ok, I finally convinced my wife to bin apple off and get a pixel 9 phone. So far the voice to text is better. But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life / wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc / payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this 🤣 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue. Every time a Bluetooth device powers off the audio just stops, I'm using the same apps, audible, Everand etc. "

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)"

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."

negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues, Audio Issues, Technical']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"

However when I did this, my SIM card was no longer being read. I am on Three UK and the anywhere in the settings where the SIM card was mentioned or network was mentioned was greyed out. I tried a bunch of solutions.This included:- Restarting the device multiple times- Resetting the network settings- Turning the device off for the day (I thought it might have been an overheating issue)Nothing worked, so I decided to flash the device with Googles browser flashing service. I tried the other latest build, AP2A.240605.024.A1, but I had the same issue. I almost gave up but then I thought to try the previous Android14 build that was on the 8 Pro, AP1A.240505.005.B1. This worked! I can use my network again on my Pixel 8 Pro. I will raise this as a bug with Android. I thought to post here also just in case other people were having the same issue. All the best."
negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here's everything you need to know!+At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"
negative,"[' Audio Issues: audio, sound, User Experience: experience, user, Others: other']","Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment]+I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.Usecase 1) - **Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -** I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away. ***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.*** I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread - [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1)Usecase 2) - **Standardized gestures to move back -** iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.Usecase 3) - **Selecting files/images -** Selecting multiple images/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.Usecase 4) - **Blocking spam message senders -** Most of us get probably dozens of spam/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.Usecase 5) - **View images/documents on Files app -** Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page - [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255068777?sortBy=best)It seems to be happening on ipads as well.So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience. "

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

negative,"[' Audio, User Experience, Technical, Bluetooth']","Why I’m Returning My $1600+ Samsung S25 Ultra – And You Might Too+Edit: Yes, I wrote this message myself and used ChatGPT to format it for better readability. The content remains the same—just easier to follow. If you would rather see my poorly written review DM me lol. Original post:I was initially skeptical of the widespread criticism surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but after receiving my 1TB model, I quickly understood the frustration. I had planned to trade in my Galaxy S22 for $600, expecting a substantial upgrade. However, after testing the S25 Ultra, I found the differences to be minimal—certain aspects even felt like a downgrade.Underwhelming Improvements for a Premium PriceWith a starting price of $1,400, I expected significant enhancements, but the S25 Ultra left me unimpressed. The phone doesn’t feel noticeably faster, and the cameras actually seem to perform worse than previous models. The macro photography, which I was particularly excited about, was a letdown—my old Note 5 captured better close-up shots. Additionally, Samsung removed Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, reducing its versatility.Samsung’s AI Promises Were MisleadingSamsung heavily marketed AI as the defining feature of the S25 Ultra, claiming during its launch event that all AI processing could be done locally on the device. This turned out to be misleading. Even after enabling the ""local AI"" setting to keep data on-device, I found that many features still required cloud access to function. This raises privacy concerns and contradicts Samsung’s core marketing message.AI and Image Generation Fell FlatBeyond the misleading AI claims, the phone’s generative image features were disappointing. Samsung positioned AI as the main selling point of the S25 Ultra, yet the execution feels rushed and underdeveloped. Instead of true AI innovation, it seems like Samsung is simply riding the AI hype train without delivering a meaningful user experience.Not Enough to Justify the Price TagAt $1,400 and up, the S25 Ultra needed to bring substantial improvements, but it doesn’t. This release feels more like an incremental iPhone-style update—something unexpected from Samsung, which was once known for pushing boundaries. Rather than innovating, they seem to be cutting corners while relying on AI buzzwords.For the first time ever, I’m returning a Samsung device. If you decided to keep your old phone instead of upgrading, let me know in the comments."

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"

OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you’re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I’ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it’s easy to switch between the two.2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google’s Circle to Search feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgOP6XMAAQHEb?format=jpg&name=large) to OnePlus phones, finally.4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It’ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it’ll basically let you ask questions like “how much is my next phone bill?” and then it’ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing…but honestly it seems like it’s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently? In any case, your OnePlus phone now has Android’s Theft Protection feature, so go turn ‘em on."

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

I’ve included a description of each app/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn’t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https://i.imgur.com/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https://i.imgur.com/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn’t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn’t able to get notes to sync reliably. It’s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can’t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn’t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https://i.imgur.com/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https://i.imgur.com/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https://i.imgur.com/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https://i.imgur.com/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https://i.imgur.com/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It’s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn’t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https://i.imgur.com/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https://i.imgur.com/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https://i.imgur.com/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn’t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https://i.imgur.com/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It’s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn’t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google’s desktop Quick Share app](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https://i.imgur.com/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop.

Real life problems when moving to android there is no solution for. +Ok, I finally convinced my wife to bin apple off and get a pixel 9 phone. So far the voice to text is better. But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life / wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc / payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this 🤣 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue. Every time a Bluetooth device powers off the audio just stops, I'm using the same apps, audible, Everand etc. "
negative,"["" Audio Issues: audio, sound\n\nYour concerns about the unpolished notification system on Samsung Galaxy phones have been noted. The issue seems to be that the notification sounds are played simultaneously and in serial, which can be overwhelming for some users. The user experience category would also apply as it appears the current design is not optimized for the user's needs, particularly when watching videos or typing messages. In these situations, users have expressed a preference for prioritizing their activities over hearing multiple notification sounds at once.\n\nTo address this, it would be recommended to:\n1. Play only the first notification sound upon unlocking the phone.\n2. Use vibration as an additional indicator for incoming notifications when watching videos or typing messages.\n3. Implement sensors for user activity (e.g., screen on/off, holding the phone) to optimize the notification experience accordingly.\n4. Allow users to customize the notification sound settings to their preferences, such as turning off specific notification sounds or adjusting the volume for different types of notifications.\n5. Continuously monitor user feedback and make necessary improvements to the notification system to ensure it meets user expectations and provides a positive user experience.\n6. Consider implementing a feature that groups similar notifications together, allowing users to choose whether they want to hear the sounds or just see the visual notifications without being distracted by multiple auditory cues.""]","Why is the notification system so unpolished? (for at least a decade!) Or am I missing something?+So I am going to talk about Samsung galaxy phones mainly because that's what I use but I guess the same goes for any other android phone, correct me if I am wrong.Since I remember using android more than 10 years ago this issue persists. And I wonder why like are you ok with this? It seems so outlandish to me that nobody else is bothered by it or better that most people are not bothered by it.... The notification system is irritating without reason and stupid like the opposite of AI (even useless stupid AI like bixby is more intelligent than the notification system)   Like e.g I charge my phone I dont hear anything, I unlock it..

Like why is it so stupid? Make the first notification sound when user unlocks the phone and then if he still watches the screen/holds the phone (it has sensors for that yet ironically unused in cases like these which would have been most important for UX but apparently they prefer to use them mostly as telemetry data for ads...:/ ) then just buz the vibration a little bit and show the other notifications incoming graphically.....    Like I watch the phone right now, I operate it! I dont need 100 notification sounds busting my ears... I see them incoming that's enough I got notified ! lol     Also when watching something on full screen or writing a message etc it should PRIORITIZE use cases, user watching movie? we just buzz not play notification sounds same if user types a message....     I know there is an option **to disable notifications** for a while     **but I WANT them**! It is not that I want to disable them.       like I want to know if there an incoming message or a friend request etc I just dont need to have them all play in serial and simultaneously the notification sound......     I am operating the phone I see the screen I can tell that there are notifications incoming there is no need to shower me with multiple sounds endlessly...  "

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)"

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."

Government Incentives: Governments could provide subsidies or tax incentives for companies that invest in innovative R&D projects, helping offset costs and encourage competition in this area.\n3. User-driven Innovation: Companies could engage users more effectively in the development process, soliciting feedback on features they would like to see and incorporating their ideas into new devices.\n4. Open Source Development: Making smartphone software and hardware open-source could allow for a larger community of developers to contribute to innovation, leading to faster advancements and a wider variety of solutions.\n5. Public Education: Increasing awareness of the benefits and potential of new technologies among consumers can help drive demand for more innovative devices, pushing companies to invest in R&D to meet that demand.\n6. Embracing Risk: Companies could take on more risk by investing in projects with uncertain outcomes, recognizing that some failures are necessary for breakthroughs to occur.\n7. Regulatory Reform: Governments could ease regulations and standards around smartphone design, materials, and functionality, allowing companies more freedom to innovate without fear of violating rules or facing penalties.\n8. Long-term Vision: Companies could prioritize long-term growth over short-term profits, investing in research and development projects that may not yield immediate returns but could lead to significant advancements in the future.\n\nUltimately, addressing the stagnation of innovation in the smartphone industry will require a combination of these solutions, as well as new ideas and approaches that have yet to be conceived. Collaborative efforts between companies, governments, and users can help drive innovation and keep the technology landscape exciting and dynamic.']","What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?+I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in ""flagship"" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the ""old"" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the ""normal"" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \*trying\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have ""extra space"" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a ""flagship"" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a ""flagship"" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for ""security concerns"" (which are valid, except that these ""security concerns"" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN/password is entered, the orientation/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often/with what parameters you need to use a PIN/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification/utility panel), navigation bars, ""recent apps"" screens, or other integral UI/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called ""navbar"") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification/utility panel) (the app I use is called ""oneshade"") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \*mostly\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \*can\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a ""flagship"" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with ""flagship"" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a ""flagship"" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the ""solution"" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory ""capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first"" to the theory of ""this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things"" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."

I don't like the way that they auto-expand and take up a ton of screen real estate when I don't even want to read a message or notification yet (hence mostly disabling them, and just in case other people are around). Similar concept with bubbles where I don't like them constantly being on my screen, and I'd rather be in the in-app UI because I'll be opening the app anyway to read and reply.What I am interested in a lot of the time though is who the notifications are from, and from there I'd know if I want to read it or open it right away. The way that the Dynamic Spot app executes this is perfect in my opinion. When I get a message, I have it set to move out from my camera cutout to show the profile picture and app icon. This also works for my Twitter notifications and shows YouTube and Spotify thumbnails as they're playing, with a nice colored visualizer animation that really sets the tone. Add that to things like alarms, timers, other media players, and calls and you really have a formula to make floating notifications unintrusive (by keeping it in the status bar), functional, and visually pleasing. One of the best parts is that if there's nothing happening, you don't have a huge black bubble and it all goes back to a normal screen. Another is that you can choose whether you want the small island to auto-expand, and if not, easily tap to expand with options such as mark as read, reply, and control media. It's all so convenient and visually pleasing, which is something that's a bit lacking in just using the notification shade. I love the way that it uses the already black area of your screen and turns it into a living, breathing part of your phone (like iOS does). It also makes it easier to directly focus on and access one particular thing with just a tap rather than multiple swipes.While a lot of people call the iOS Dynamic Island gimmicky, I believe that it definitely has its uses such as timers, indicators, and pleasing animations, and combining that native implementation with the features, execution, and customization of Dynamic Spot would truly elevate it to something great on Android that makes a previously useless feature (for me) into my favorite way notifications are delivered. I know that they'll be implementing something similar in future Android versions with the pill, but I think the way it expands and blends with the camera is really a great way to do it, and I wouldn't mind copying it from iOS."

However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and *then* pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating."

Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: ""find nearby,"" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11). The Find My Device app on my ereader shows the Google tags, but they're not present on my Chromebook’s Find My Device app.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don’t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them. If you have Nest devices in the house they do help locate your Google tags which is great as they say “your keys were last seen at 9:10 near bedroom display”, I’m going to guess that with Google TVs acting as hubs in Google Home soon this will also help find your devices/Google tags.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don’t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them.

For example, Chromebooks could totally be added to Google's Find My Device network. Apple users can track their Macbooks with the Find My network, so it'd be awesome if Google could do something like that for Chromebooks and even Windows laptops. Judging how someone got Quickshare on MacOS, we’ll probably see someone make it possible for Linux and Windows later on."

I work extensively with digital media and have high demands for my phone. I made the switch partly out of curiosity and partly because Samsung no longer offers clear advantages for my needs (SD cards, aux port, file system advantages\*)Samsung Pros:Ergonomics: The S-series is lighter and feels better in hand.  Better internal file system: It's easier to get an overall picture of files and manage special formats flac, avi...  Text selection and copying are much easier, thanks to an excellent clipboard.  Faster navigation between apps, especially with swipe gestures.  Faster file transfer speeds with USB cable and Samsung Smart Switch app.  Some apps are better equipped, like Firefox with addons including adblock.  Easier camera app settings.  Customization options for visuals and sounds.  Useful features like alarm telling you how much time you have remaining – and timer-based Do Not Disturb.Samsung Cons:Bloatware: Samsung Pass, Bixby, Samsung Store, Wallet, etc.  Swipe gestures can interfere with image browsing.  Not as streamlined as iPhone, occasional hiccups.  Files app doesn't update Google Drive in real-time.  Some native apps are inferior or missing compared to iPhone.iPhone Pros:Eyecapturing design.

Efficient file management for cloud services and communication with MacBook.  Lidar! (for easy 3D scanning and spacial measurements)  Quick Translate feature.  Very good battery life.iPhone Cons:File system still a bit messy – for example uploading an ""image"" from iphone ""files"" might not be available in every app (workarounds are not too complicated)  Less screen space for content due to unoptimized bottom and top areas.  Difficulties in copying and selecting text.  Poor ""BACK"" navigation, no uniform design, very complicated with one hand.

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Technical, Voice Quality, User Experience']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "
negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues, Audio Issues']","Android should really change how it works+As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn’t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting—the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument."

I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"

And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions+I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https://oukitel.com/products/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the ""Force full GNSS measurements"" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus+In case it matters, I'm in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided ""No Samsung"" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's ""Smart Panel"" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen.

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors – Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.“The OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.” – said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets — the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces ""360 Mind and Body"", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical, Video Issues, Bluetooth, WiFi']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here’s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you’d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year’s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue “Icyblue” color, a light green “Mint” color, a dark blue “Navy” color, and a gray “Silver Shadow” color. They are also available in a black “Blueblack” color, a gold “Pinkgold” color, and a red “Coralred” color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black “Titanium Black” color, a gray “Titanium Gray” color, a light blue “Titanium Blue” color, and a silver “Titanium White Silver” color. It’s also available in a black “ Titanium Jetblack” color, green “Jadegreen” color, and a gold “Titanium Pinkgold” color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year’s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56” image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3” image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120° field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.While there aren’t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn’t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That’s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That’s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it’s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What’s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with “Made for Galaxy” partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (“Find photos from my trip to Italy”).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you’d like to change.     * Eg. if you say “make my text more visible” you’ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical, Call drop']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"
negative,"[' User Experience, Technical, Video Issues, Service']","Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3+Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder’s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."

I’ve included a description of each app/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn’t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there’s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https://i.imgur.com/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https://i.imgur.com/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn’t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn’t able to get notes to sync reliably. It’s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can’t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https://i.imgur.com/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn’t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https://i.imgur.com/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https://i.imgur.com/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https://i.imgur.com/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https://i.imgur.com/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https://i.imgur.com/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It’s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn’t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https://i.imgur.com/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https://i.imgur.com/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https://i.imgur.com/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn’t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https://i.imgur.com/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It’s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn’t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google’s desktop Quick Share app](https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https://i.imgur.com/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there’s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https://i.imgur.com/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https://i.imgur.com/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https://i.imgur.com/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren’t. It’s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn’t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https://i.imgur.com/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https://i.imgur.com/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https://i.imgur.com/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https://i.imgur.com/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https://i.imgur.com/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It’s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https://i.imgur.com/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https://i.imgur.com/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https://i.imgur.com/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works. It makes sense since those are all Chromium-based browsers."
negative,"[' Audio Issues: [""audio"", ""sound""]']","Android VS iPhone. Real life problems when moving to android there is no solution for. +Ok, I finally convinced my wife to bin apple off and get a pixel 9 phone. So far the voice to text is better. But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life / wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc / payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this 🤣 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue. Every time a Bluetooth device powers off the audio just stops, I'm using the same apps, audible, Everand etc. "

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Technical, Bluetooth']","Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25+Alongside updates to [Gemini](https://www.androidfaithful.com/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/) and [Circle to Search](https://www.androidfaithful.com/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https://www.resound.com/en-us/) and [Oticon Intent](https://www.oticon.com/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."
negative,"[' User Experience, Audio, Video, Technical, Service, Support']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"
negative,"["" User Experience, Technical, Others\n\nThe flagship smartphone concept seems to have deviated from its original purpose, focusing more on marketing and less on innovation and advancement. This stagnation could be due to various reasons such as:\n\n1. Capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts shareholders first: Critics argue that the focus on maximizing profits over innovation is a consequence of the capitalist system.\n2. This isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things: Supporters of the current market trend suggest that consumers are content with the status quo and do not desire significant changes in their smartphones.\n3. Regulatory barriers and lack of competition in the industry: The smartphone market may have limited opportunities for differentiation due to regulatory restrictions or a lack of significant competition.\n4. Resource allocation and risk management: Companies may prioritize investment in areas with higher returns, leading to slower innovation in certain areas such as smartphones.\n5. Obsolescence strategy: By regularly releasing new models with minimal changes, companies can maintain high sales volumes by encouraging consumers to upgrade their devices frequently.\n6. Lack of customer feedback and demand for innovative features: Companies may not prioritize new features if they do not receive enough positive customer feedback or requests for such innovations.\n\nTo fix this issue, it is essential to encourage a culture of innovation within the industry by fostering collaboration between companies, investing in R&D, and listening more closely to consumer feedback. Additionally, regulatory bodies could consider implementing policies that promote competition and innovation in the smartphone market. Ultimately, however, it is up to consumers to express their desire for more advanced and innovative devices through their purchasing decisions.""]","What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?+I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in ""flagship"" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the ""old"" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the ""normal"" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \*trying\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have ""extra space"" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a ""flagship"" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a ""flagship"" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for ""security concerns"" (which are valid, except that these ""security concerns"" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN/password is entered, the orientation/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often/with what parameters you need to use a PIN/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification/utility panel), navigation bars, ""recent apps"" screens, or other integral UI/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called ""navbar"") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification/utility panel) (the app I use is called ""oneshade"") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \*mostly\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \*can\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a ""flagship"" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with ""flagship"" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a ""flagship"" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the ""solution"" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory ""capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first"" to the theory of ""this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things"" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."

It was fine, and a fun little device, which was actually great since I've always preferred smaller phones. But, after a few experiments gone wrong, I messed up both the headphone jack and the battery, so I got the Galaxy S7 two years later when it came out. It was a great upgrade at the time, with a vibrant OLED screen, fingerprint scanner, great (for the time) camera, and waterproofing, although its size was still bigger than I would have liked. I used it for another year or two, then hopped around on a couple other phones I bought used online, then stopped at the Galaxy S10e which I've been using since I got it in 2020. It's been one fantastic device with basically everything I want: small-ish size, headphone jack (which could no longer be taken for granted at the time, unfortunately), OLED screen, waterproof, and USB-C.But, at more than 5 years old now, its battery is showing its age. Even with light browsing I find myself needing to reach for a charger, and any travel requires a battery bank. So, I looked around with dismay at Androids nowadays and see that almost nothing else is small and has a headphone jack, which is a key feature that I want since wired earbuds is the hill I will absolutely die on. I would have loved to try the Zenfone 10, which is basically the new Galaxy S10e in both size and functionality, but I'm also on a non-GSM carrier through my family that doesn't support it. So, if I can't get a headphone jack on Android, I might as well go back to Apple since it's what everyone is raving about, blue bubbles and all, and it's probably improved a lot in 8 years.I picked up a used iPhone 13 mini since I love the small size of it and used it for a month. Setup was smooth with Apple's fantastic Android switching process. Face unlock is pretty great too, coming from the S10e's fingerprint scanner which is sometimes hit-or-miss for me. But, that's where the fun ended. I immediately noticed that I took a downgrade in almost everything, listed below:\- The vibration was so much weaker. The Taptic Engine doesn't pack nearly as much punch as the S10e, which is average in terms of vibration in my estimation. This was for the notifications that vibrated at all in the first place.\- Microsoft Teams and Outlook, which I use for work, simply refused to vibrate for notifications. I tried looking in every setting under the sun and coudn't find out why they wouldn't vibrate. Sounds were enabled, notifications were enabled, phone was not on silent, everything. Extremely infuriating.\- You can't disable the phone shutter sound, for the camera OR screenshots, when not on silent. I want to hear a ringtone for calls, but that's it. Having to pick one or another was also quite annoying.\- Holding the power button doesn't turn the phone off anymore. Minor, but kind of annoying to me as well.\- For some apps, including WhatsApp and eBay, I couldn't set silent notification sounds. I prefer to have silent notifications for everything except phone calls. The only option is to disable notification sounds, but I found it also disables vibrations.\- Apple Autocorrect has quite an annoying feature where it sometimes autocorrects groups of words. My style is to ensure individual words are typed correctly, and once I press the spacebar, the word is done. Apple thinks otherwise and ""fixes"" words I typed correctly.\- The touchscreen is much less sensitive. With the S10e, I find that I can still use it with thin gloves. No such thing with the iPhone that instead needs to feel my bare skin.\- No camera quick launch. Samsung phones have had camera quick launch for years by double pressing the power button, even from lock. Great for getting the camera ready immediately to capture fast incidents. No such thing on Apple, where the process to open the camera on the lock screen is slightly slower.\- iOS gallery doesn't separate screenshots and photos into separate folders, which happens with the Samsung. Extremely annoying to me, since I like to organize my photos accordingly. Screenshots kind of get lost among photos.\- I knew what I was getting into going in, but not having a headphone jack was extremely disappointing. It felt much less convenient needing to bust out the dongle to plug my earbuds in, almost discouraging.\- iOS hides your notifications once you unlock the screen. On Android, they stay both on the lock screen and on the swipe-down menu. Plus, there are tiny icons at the top that show you which apps have unaddressed notifications. iOS has the red bubble alerts, but you can't see them all from one place, unless you do two gestures instead of one to see past notifications in the Notification Center.\- iTunes syncing for local MP3s, which is how I listen to my music, is still more complex then it needs to be, whereas Android is still good ol' drag-and-drop.\- You can't bring Shazams over from Android to Apple. I would have lost a bunch of history or have to log in on the web version to see my Android Shazams.\- I found my thumbs tingling more using the iPhone instead of Samsung. I think it might have been from the left-swipe-to-go-back gesture, which is a bigger gesture than pressing the always-present back button at the bottom of Androids.\- iOS kept the keyboard lower on the screen than Android, which made typing a little more difficult.With the direction that Apple is going, with no more Mini devices (which was one of the things to entice me back over) and further removing functionality by axing the SIM slot in favor of eSIMs, and the above problems, I decided that iOS still isn't for me. Now I'll probably have to babysit my battery more or settle for something bigger. Currently I have my eyes on the Galaxy XCover 6 Pro. But happy to be back :)"
negative,"[' Audio, Video, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","Lock screen interactions on Android are clunky+As an iOS user who's looking to replace an aging iPhone 11 soon, I am seriously considering the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 Pro. However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and *then* pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Video Issues, Service, Support, Others, Technical, Voice Quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, Call drop']","A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus+In case it matters, I'm in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided ""No Samsung"" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's ""Smart Panel"" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications → Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on → Screen turn-on control* The description for ""allow camera software extensions"" has been updated to say ""...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions"" when previously it ended with ""...such as Eyes Free videography.""  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"
negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Bluetooth, Voice Quality']","Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25+Alongside updates to [Gemini](https://www.androidfaithful.com/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/) and [Circle to Search](https://www.androidfaithful.com/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https://www.resound.com/en-us/) and [Oticon Intent](https://www.oticon.com/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."
negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Service, Support, Others, Technical']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"

negative,"[' Audio Issues, Video Issues, User Experience, Technical, Call drop']","Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review +Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I’d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic ""smooth display"" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing ""Pixel touch"", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you’ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it’s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you’ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You’re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let’s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you’ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn’t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn’t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159€ flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker’s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn’t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to….successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I’d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159€.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the ""Android version"" [no longer says](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) ""VanillaIceCream"" but rather ""15."" The ""preview SDK"" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **""Home Controls"" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone’s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone’s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the ""charging rapidly"" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **""show long app names""** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout ""automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device."" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**.

negative,"[' Audio Issues, User Experience, Technical, Voice Quality']","A note on the Google Tensor G5+A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185767/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https://x.com/Golden\_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063](https://x.com/Golden_Reviewer/status/1712878926505431063)[https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https://youtu.be/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17032/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."
negative,"[' audio, user experience, service, support, others, technical, voice quality, bluetooth, wifi, call drop']","Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A+My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization / Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the “clear” notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- → B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue “in particularly shortly” when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK £30 vs £34.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https://ibb.co/4NHpK38](https://ibb.co/4NHpK38)[https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc](https://ibb.co/z4PKqFc)"

negative,"[' User Experience, Video Issues, Audio Issues']","This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve+I know this is not an iOS/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c42zw2/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have/). At the end, it made me think: ""What does iOS even have then?"" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/803/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's ""on the tracks"". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https://dubz.co/c/11e4ff). Android tells you, ""You want to change the app? Let go and try again"". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https://dubz.co/c/0c6f0e). These types of ""I go only this way and that's it"" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX/UI should be like a ""ripple effect"", when a user dips their finger in the ""water"" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https://streamable.com/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more ""alive"" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https://streamable.com/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https://dubz.link/c/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select ""150"" value on a seek bar](https://streamable.com/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https://i.postimg.cc/xdV6Lr2c/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https://dubz.co/c/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https://dubz.link/c/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the ""brush"" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https://postimg.cc/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https://i.postimg.cc/8D4hRRby/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https://i.postimg.cc/Wbk0JXSf/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https://i.postimg.cc/nHqJgHCd/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https://streamable.com/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https://dubz.link/c/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"
