I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."},"11":{"post_title":"Exclusive: This is the Google Pixel 9 Pro in All 4 Colors","self_text":""},"12":{"post_title":"What 3 to 4 features do you think Google must focus on Android 16?","self_text":"Fellows, I have been enjoying my Pixel 8a for around a month, but I still think there are a couple of features that Google should improve. In my case, if I were the Product Owner, I'd like to try to focus on three topics:1. **Complete the freefloating form feature.** I have tested it, and for me, it was something I actually missed from my old Oppo A91. It seems almost ready, but I cannot overlap apps in my phone. Maybe it's a bug, but I would rather this than the Bubbles for all.2. **Improve the video camera.** I went to Sweden to see the Northern Lights and the [results](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DD6kIEPtQEj\/?img_index=1) were better than I expected. However, the videos were terrible. I could barely see anything.3. **Allow double-tap to lock.** Several phones have it including my old Huawei.I have also some nice to have:* Bring back the tiles for Data and WiFi or at least, give us the developers the right to the dirty job. I know it's controversial, but I'd like to have them.* Allow the phone to be scheduled when to turn it on or off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow the Alarm to turn on the phone if it's off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow swiping actions like the three fingers for taking screenshots. My old Oppo has it.Maybe you have other ideas or agree with mine. I prefer to focus on specific features that, if we're lucky, the Android\/Pixel product owner might hear us out about before they dive deeper into development of things that we might not like or agree with their \"research\". Plus, if we just rely on sending feedback through the app, I find it often ends up on deaf ears.Have amazing holidays."},"13":{"post_title":"Who is still using their Pixel 4\/XL in 2024?","self_text":"I am.

Currently have a Pixel 6a and recently experienced the following problems:* Wifi continuously disconnects on my home network (two Google Wifi pucks).  This just started in February after a phone update, nothing else changed.  Same internet, same wifi.  So Google broke this obviously and it's impossible to get help.  My family owns iPhones, and two Pixel users (Pixel 7) who aren't experiencing this.  My wifi works great on every wifi network but my home network.* When I make a phone call and need to hit \"1\" for a menu option, it doesn't work.  Call on my wife's iPhone, works fine.  Give me a break...* The Youtube app starts flaking after some amount of time, no pause button and the video is dark.  I have to kill the app to fix it, and then a while later it starts flaking again.With today's tech it seems everything that is working perfectly well is at risk of breaking with the next update.  If Apple gets it right and their product just works when I need it to work, then I'll make the switch.

He then checked his phone and there was NO open app or recent notification.Before anyone asks if \u201che was dreaming\u201d, he walked out to the living room to tell me about it and I could hear his phone from the bedroom speaking some OTHER message (we couldn\u2019t hear it from there exactly what the message said).Not sure if it\u2019s connected, but his phone recently updated to Android 15.

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"34":{"post_title":"June Feature Drop: Pixel 8 Display Port mirroring, 6\/7 Pro Manual Lens Selection, PW2 Car Crash Detection","self_text":""},"35":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 significant upgrade over Pixel 7","self_text":"The 9 feels like a legitimate flagship even though it's not the Pro version.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"41":{"post_title":"Poll: Would you buy the Pixel 10 if it had free unlimited photo backups?","self_text":""},"42":{"post_title":"Why i'm saying goodbye to Pixel after almost 10 years \ud83e\udd79 ","self_text":"Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?"},"43":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google picks a MediaTek modem for the Pixel 10 series","self_text":""},"44":{"post_title":"Do you think Google will go big with Pixel 10?","self_text":"Do you think since it will be their 10th iteration of a phone, that they will \"go big\"?

The pros are obvious and stated by other users here as well as on CNET, Wired, CNET, etc.\u00a0On the flip side, the phone has fallen victim to the same fallacy affecting other first-generation novelties - focusing on the breakthrough feature but sacrificing both basic features associated with a smartphone. Moreover, the Fold (even when compared to the Galaxy) is quite rudimentary and lfalls short with heuristics that define the user experience interacting with a table-type phone.* Battery - Terrible as always. I\u2019ve never had a Pixel phone where I didn\u2019t have the battery saver on by defaults nd it still dies within 3\/4 of my day without charge* No good case - Even , the front portion of the case easily loses its adhesiveness around the 2-3 mm border. This is more of an issue with the case, but the design of the phone itself does not allow for an appropriate case for the front panel* Front panel - Very difficult to backwards swipe to go to a previous web page when viewing in a broswer- will usually just translate to the next Home Screen panel * Fold display - this clearly a first draft and I wish I had waited for the third. So many issues:   * Screen takes 2-3 seconds to \u201cturn on\u201d when unfolding the phone   * Google tries very hard to describe the two panel feature, but it is FAR from self-explanatory.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"76":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro pre-order in India starts Oct 17 (Flipkart)","self_text":"Finally the flipkart page for Google Pixel 9 Pro (non-XL) has been updated from being basically non-existent to showing that the pre-orders will start this week!Does anyone have any idea when they might start shipping it, will we have to wait till November as suggested by Google's account informing people in the comments?"},"77":{"post_title":"Got the pixel 7A for \u00a317 a month ","self_text":"On a 24 month contract with 300gb data.

It's a Redmi Y2\/S2. I've been using it as my primary device for almost 7 years. Now I've been using it with custom roms and that's how I got new software on old hardware. Currently it's running lineage 22.1 (android 15) and still amazing.It doesn't have a good processor (snapdragon 625) but it's a powerhouse, it lasts really long hours even though it's just 3000mah. Now the lag is probably because of low ram and storage that is 3\/32 but it works out for me. I still play games like (shadow fight 2) (carx rally) etc.Whenever i think of upgrading to a new one I feel the feeling of losing something important since I have quite a lot of memories attached to this phone and I just don't want to say goodbye to it yet.It still has decent camera, taking pictures are pretty good since I've been using \"Google Camera\" and it's awesome. I've been using it for this many years and it's camera still blows my mind (maybe due to google cam)I've broken the screen once and got it replaced back in 2020 and also got the battery replaced but still don't have the mind of updating to a newer modal.I'm pretty sure that even if I hadn't installed custom rom on it I still would've been using it till today (i could've just formatted it countless times). It had android 9 at the start and after update would've gotten to android 10.I'm amazed by people who really genuinely believe that phones need to be upgraded every 1-2 years, if you have the mind you can use it for as long as the software supports it.
