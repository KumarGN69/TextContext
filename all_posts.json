            "self_text": "I woke up at 1am to find my Google Pixel 5 spewing white hot sparks and acrid smoke into my bedroom. The smoke was so thick that I reckon if I'd hadn't woken when I did, the missus and I would probably be dead. Two kids in the house too. I managed to get everyone out the house and somehow got the flaming device out the back door.It burned so hot as to char the wood of my bedside table, and melt spots in the carpet where sparks and debris landed. The room and house absolute stink of acrid, chemical smoke, and we all ended up sleeping on sofas and floors downstairs.The response from Google has been rather luke warm. Their first response was: \"too bad, phone is out of warranty\", but they did eventually relent and have sent me a refurbished Pixel 5. No replacement charger or cable or anything. They also sent a specialist courier to collect the damaged phone, but I have no further communication, apology, or offer to cover any of the damage done.It's left me and the family rather traumatised, as I didn't expect this of a branded Google phone - one that I bought direct from the Google Store, no-less.Should I pursue this further?"

            "self_text": "**Hey everyone!** I wanted to share something cool I noticed after flashing my **Google Pixel 2 XL to Android 14.** I\u2019ve been using this phone for **5 years** \u2014 since January 23, 2020. As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I\u2019ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition \u2014 it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! \ud83d\udc4fAnyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences? Drop a comment \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your stories!"

This device is very impressive but just a beast in hand compared to the 5, which was perfect weight and size IMO. I'm considering downgrading to the Pixel 8 but don't know if it will really make the comfort difference I'm hoping it does. Weights: - P5: 151 g (5.3 oz)- P8: 187 g (6.6 oz) - 1.23x P5 weight- 9P: 198 g (6.98 oz) - 1.31x P5 weightWeight not being everything, i hear the squared edges of the P9P also contribute to this feeling. Just physically picked up the P5 for a bit after typing up this post on the P9P and i found myself wishing i didn't have to leave the older device behind. But lack of security updates, poor camera quality and continued performance issues have started making this switch inevitable. Anybody having similar experiences? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you "

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken. Yes we could still support an iPhone 6, but have you tried using one? It's so slow you can't really use it. Forced obsolescence is what pisses me off. Yes, I knew it from the beginning. That does not make it ok. "

And I keep the screen always at lower brightness than I would like.- Overheating: It's true that we are experiencing hotter summer than ever, but when outside the camera app makes it overheat SO quickly. I've had the device turning off for overheat while I was taking a video(and I was inside a house)...now I just \"let it rest\" for a few minutes when I feel it is overheating.- Modem: always been crappy, especially for people travelling in different regions of the world, the pixel is not the device to own. Happy that they've given up and the Pixel 9 modem will be Samsung made.- Software-based locked\/removed features just to make the Pixel 8 Pro more enticing (as if the Pixel 8 is a cheap entry model ).I don't know how to evaluate new devices anymore, every time a new device comes out it seems like the perfect device with incredible reviews, but the reality is that I had a better experience on my Pixel 5."

However, myself personally I don't fully understand why folks think the TSMC move will be the silver bullet people think it will be. Maybe I'm missing something...I have a few questions that sum up my doubts:1. I thought the main issue with Tensor is the design based on Exynos? Is this correct? 2. If Google is taking their Exynos-tweaked design and just changing fabs to TSMC then won't the underlying Exynos design issues still hold Tensor back? Even if we see some efficiency gains from the fab process?3. Won't there be some growing pains moving from a Samsung fab to a TSMC fab?Just some thoughts that keep lingering in my head. Yes, I dare say that simply applying an improved fabrication process will help, but I keep doubting that it's going to be the improvement some folks think it will be. "

The battery was definitely swelling.A quick Google search lead me to a few posts on this subreddit where people said they had good experiences getting Google to replace their phone\u2014even out of warranty\u2014but those posts were all over a year old.I reached out to support anyway, explained my situation, sent photos of the bulge, and was pleasantly surprised to see a shipping alert the next day. It arrived the day after that. 3 days total from initial outreach to delivery!The cherry on top is that I bought this phone used on eBay, so the replacement is actually in *better* condition than mine was when I bought it. I wish Google would make a real successor to the Pixel 5... The size, rear fingerprint sensor, and almost complete lack of camera bump are basically impossible to find today.Hope this helps someone!"

I have mine since release, that's just over 4 years now and it still runs great. I will only buy a new one when this one eventually dies. Reason is there is no new phone model which I find appealing.And the main reason is: size, weight, shape and designIt just leighs really nicely in the hand. No sharp, flat sides, small size, low weight.I also like the front camera in the corner, where it distracts the least. And it has a physical finger print sensor which you can find blindly just by feel of the finger. Bezels where also already really good and even, not important but nice to look at.I have a new mid tier Samsung phone at work which is the same size and shape as every modern phone, including the Pixel 9, with its iPhone clone design language. And I hate it. It's not nice to hold in the hand, it's not easily taken out of pockets. It just sucks because it's so bulky.When did we move back in phone evolution? Look at the [two pictures ](https:\/\/www.imgur.com\/a\/31yCXGB), how can the Pixel 5 be the much older Phone?I really hope Google goes back to the Pixel 8 design with the 10 and also brings out a mini version, but I highly doubt it.

It's light, it's small, I love the matte back. I've never needed a case and I've dropped it a bunch of times. Screen has minimal scratches, from my purse likely.I had picked up the P8 back in January and couldn't even hold it in my hands and had to return it. The P9s look absolutely gorgeous in comparison to the P8s imo, especially now that I've discovered that the Pros have a matte back.I just love how small and light it is.I'm not sure when the updates will stop for the P5, but mine still seems to be going somewhat strong. Only in the last month have I noticed some lagging, and I wonder if that's because of a mobile game I got invested in.How are your P5s holding up?I'm expecting my phone to start to decline, but I'm unsure how long it will hold out. Should the P9 be my next phone, or will my P5 hold out until the P10??I'm so conflicted \ud83d\ude29"

I finally got fed up with charging multiple times a day so I decided to to grab the iFixit kit for 65 USD.Now I'm a pretty techy person but I was absolutely terrified of bricking my phone. I've built computers and torn apart laptops so I'm somewhat familiar with messing with internal components but tiny little phones are a different ball game.I was as careful as I could be. I followed the iFixit guide and pryed the screen open as was shown. I unscrewed all the screws necessary and yanked the old battery out which was the hardest part. I broke the black adhesive pull tabs so I had to brute force it out which was horrifying to do. I had to pry and cut all the adhesive out with the provided tools. After this I plugged the new battery in, screwed in the back plate and plugged in the screen to test. I cannot tell you the relief I felt seeing the Google logo after holding the power button.I just wanted to share my scary but useful experience if you were on the fence about making a replacement like this. It was a stressful 2 hours but if I got it to work with all my battery yanking and the phone still turned on, then I think anyone can do it. Just follow the guide to a tee and you should be fine. The difference in battery life is night and day. Totally worth it."

If it just stopped working on me, it would've been way easier.   I can't believe that I am the most unlucky person around.... or am I?When the phone dropped, I was so excited about it I preordered it and went explicitly to a different country to get it and because of that I am forced to stick with it unless I plan another trip.It all started with the camera, It shakes Shakira's hips. I've heard another phones with optical image stabilization, but it's way more quiet. I can coup with this, but it continued and the volume button was the next one. After like half an year my volume button fell off. ON A BRAND NEW PHONE. Really? Since i was not planning to go to UK in the nearest future again because my son was born in the meantime, I had to order a new button on aliexpress and change it myself.Enough maybe? Shortly after, my screen started looking like it has fought Wolverine. Even my oneplus 3 after 3 years looked better (I use it for testing so it's still around) than my 7 pro after less than a year. I'm not keeping my phone in the same pocket with the keys, I'm not living on the sandy beach and I don't have claws so why is this happening? *Gorilla Glass Victus*. Toughest Gorilla Glass ever tested. Toughest glass my ass. It feels like cheap window glass and I'm not even sure they used the actual thing.Now this is actually enough you would say and I would agree, but there's a cherry on the top of the cake. It's been 1.5 years since I got my dream phone. Top of the line pixel 7 pro. My touchscreen stopped working on a horizontal line in the center of the screen. I'll be attaching a test of the touchscreen for clarity in the comments. I've tried everything, safe mode boot, clearing all permissions for all the apps, clearing it, spent one day trying all sort of settings and advices and nothing. It started happening randomly, not after a drop or a hit, I could expect something like that... If you spotted the single hand button on the left of the screenshot, you are correct. I use that so I can do things like accept or reject permissions since the line goes right over the center where the buttons are and without using the single hand mode I cannot press the buttons, the touch is not responsive there.I wont even mention connectivity and antena problems. I have to restart my phone after changing the sim card since it won't connect to mobile data. It randomly gets bad signal and I know for a fact it's not provider related. Every once in a while I have to restart the phone since not even plane mode on&off will help. I am an engineer and I work in mobile development, I have a decent understanding of when's one and when's another. Today I have been sitting under the sun trying to get a Bolt because my data wasn't working properly and after a couple restarts, POOF, it's working like a charm.So here I am, stuck with it and using it to search for a new phone after 1.5 years, since I, as previously mentioned, I am not planning a new trip to UK and there's no international warranty. Considering switching to iphone as a android app developer. How ironic...I can't be the only one... can I?"

            "self_text": "In about every category that makes a difference in user experience, Pixel 5 beats the Pixel 8.  I recently began realizing after using both that the Pixel 8's photos didn't look as good.  And it was bizarre to figure out why, because they seemed to clearly be *brighter* photos.  So why did they look *worse?*  Well, I figured it out.  They have darker shadows (and thus darker colors) to hide the fact that Pixel 8 has *more* sensor noise in the shadows than Pixel 5.  And yet, Pixel 8 captures more highlight detail.  Yeilding brighter photos, with more highlight detail, but ultimately inaccurate darker colors as a band-aid.  It took me a while to figure out what was happening, but I finally got it figured out by playing around with RAWs in lightroom.  I'd take two shots -- one on Pixel 5 and one on Pixel 8.  Then move the files onto the same device and compare them.  The long story short is that Pixel 5 clips highlights to save shadows, and Pixel 8 sacrafices shadows to brighten highlights -- even when both phones are set to shoot in UltraHDR.A consequence of this is that, in the vast majority of cases, Pixel 5 photos are better than Pixel 8 photos.  And that's exactly the same kind of situation or ethos that a deep comparison between the design of the two phones shows.  From their weight, to their display's peak brightness, charachteristics and calibrations, to the degree of the roundness of their corners and to the materials they're made of.  The Pixel 8's design philosophy seems to have been \"decrease user experience in the majority of cases so that a few minority use cases excell\" and the Pixel 5's design philosophy seems to have been \"decrease user experience in a few minority cases so that the vast majority of use cases are better.\"  And with this said, I think the Pixel 5 is better than the Pixel 8 and better than every other pixel phone ever made.  *Edit* Nevermind, thanks to commenters advice I tried lowering the contrast of Pixel 8 photos and *wow* it fixed the problem big time.  Google's default amount on contrast in Pixel 8 photos is *stupid.*  Dialing down the contrast by 100% (yes by 100%) reveals beautiful color seperation on this camera sensor.  *Wow.*  *It's gorgous.* I finally unlocked the true potential of this hardware, and now I think Google are idiots for turning up the stock contrast so high so as to ruin the image.  Total insanity on their part. They could have *dropped jaws* if they published low contrast photos that emphasized color accuracy and color seperation.  I don't know what they were thinking. Here are sample photos: Before: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/M7YTgQQZ#NbSMxf1Q0HoFrvAwyKebkq-mvUW4ns9FBakkObF3v2IAfter: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/E2x1RDxZ#rZheiuOxUybrP1pSEoFeB34ma9TerfBlgdYcFjfZ8To,Before: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/luwSjCiL#sG8Wn5gPyBWZyo-ZH98eVjPSmGmel4CBgz3WSR8G6hQAfter: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/lrhASSAL#_jkJQ-l-CrlyHZKRy1PnJdBjeKL_5JL9Xc_01ZPbu60,Before: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/hvpjUaSb#OZF96vOZU0H0UvbuiItmULKPo2JGjkWQ6XbnfP9T8goAfter: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/N3AzhJrQ#4f4yFmux2b9h6Xb1I-bXuA0qiNqDBMGsdAa1PNKB4vQ,Before: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/IqZG0RTI#F9KbtFfFltqlor4pCv3P-aDtpSwN60FKt4kkpUKVjAUAfter: https:\/\/mega.nz\/file\/FiBSgKTT#o5HfP9lsYU9WBJP2cr3AZEm3XkDQqOUsOdB_7zFDl1I"

This just started in February after a phone update, nothing else changed.  Same internet, same wifi.  So Google broke this obviously and it's impossible to get help.  My family owns iPhones, and two Pixel users (Pixel 7) who aren't experiencing this.  My wifi works great on every wifi network but my home network.* When I make a phone call and need to hit \"1\" for a menu option, it doesn't work.  Call on my wife's iPhone, works fine.

If Apple gets it right and their product just works when I need it to work, then I'll make the switch.

Since we don\u2019t intentionally use it, I wouldn\u2019t have known until someone suggested to look at Google Assistant history.

            "self_text": "I've been a Pixel fan ever since the original Pixel XL. I was a Motorola Droid user before the Pixel series came out, and I fell in love with the simplicity of the original Pixel XL, the slick look, the fingerprint scanner, and the capability of the phone overall. I bought my Pixel XL in July of 2017, and kept it until the battery gave up in February of 2022, when I then got the Pixel 6. I was never really overly-happy with the 6, other than the size. I felt like the battery would drain really fast with minimal use, the camera was extremely disappointing, the phone itself felt really cheap, the camera shutter made a rattling noise every time my phone would move, I could go on. Because it worked however, I kept it. The battery finally died not too long ago, and I just went to T-Mobile to trade it in for a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Good lord, right off the bat, this phone FEELS far more premium, and more worth the price tag than the 6 ever did. I like the iPhone aesthetic the phone has going on with the rounded edges. I also love the nice, large screen. I know it's not significantly bigger than the 6, but it's still noticeable to me. I especially love the new camera spot, and the way that it's raised and protected by the aluminum body, as opposed to the all-glass camera on the 6. It also has a nice weight to it, not too crazy, but enough to know you have a high-end piece of tech in your hands.As for the software, the 9 operates like I think the 6 should have. It's very reminiscent of what it felt like to switch to the original Pixel XL from my cheap Droids. The animations are smooth, and I don't even have the smooth animation option on. The themes, stock wallpapers, even ringtones are excellent. The camera is also a HUGE improvement over the 6. I would take pictures of documents to scan them with my 6, and the picture would always come out looking like my lenses were smudged, and my astral photography always left something to be desired. The camera on the 9 Pro has been phenomenal. Close-up pictures are much more clear, and the options for getting the perfect shot are plentiful. I have not tried the astral photography settings on the 9 Pro yet, but I will be doing so as soon as there's a clear night and no moon. I will say, I don't believe that the 9 Pro camera is on par with the Samsung cameras, which are some of the best on the market, but it at least rivals, if not surpasses the camera on the iPhone.Overall, Google has dramatically improved the Pixel series from the 6. The 9 Pro has better battery life, smoother operation, an overall nicer look and more premium feel, and the camera actually lives up to the hype. As long as the battery has better longevity than the battery in the 6, I'm hoping to have this phone for at least as long as I had the original Pixel XL for. I feel like Google has outdone themselves with this phone!"

Surprisingly, a refurbishing company offered me \u20ac300 for my SE.A reseller in my area has multiple boxed Pixel 6 Pro models in stock for \u20ac280. These appear to be sealed units, refurbished by Google themselves. At this price point, only POCO or Redmi devices offer bang for buck in The Netherlands.But the thing is that I\u2019ve always used flagships. All the current Chinese mid-rangers around the \u20ac300 price point I\u2019ve tried have been disappointing to me. The cost-cutting is evident in all of these devices. The shitty macro cameras, poor video recording performance, bloatware, trash UI skins and cheap build quality all left a bad taste in my mouth.The Pixel 6 Pro, while old, still is a proper flagship with a high-end camera system. The problem is that it\u2019s apparently being cut off from updates this year and I\u2019ve heard TONS of horror stories relating to the modem and battery. My SE lasts 5-6 hours on a single charge. If the Pixel has similar battery life that would be disappointing.Is someone daily driving the Pixel 6 Pro or would someone like to revisit this device for me and help me to make a decision? Thanks!"

Now everything loads properly. I'm still on 4G - EE network.  **Design**: similar size with the 6 Pro, but  overall better design without the curved edges and the glass back. I love the frosted glass on the back.   **Camera**: the camera app seem to have more options but I haven't test it properly yet. Improved detail when zooming comparing to the 6 Pro.**Thermals**: Huge improvement. The phone was not hot after an 1h+ video call. The 6 Pro was getting quite toasty at times. Even when charging, the phone is slightly warm to the touch.**AI**: I didn't touch or used Gemini. I have the Google Assistant as default and I'm happy with it.**Cons**  Even though I like the design, it does look like an iPhone which potentially makes me a target to phone thieves around London. xD  This looks like a bug, but I'm unable to set some images as wallpaper.

The phone was good enough to resell, even. I downloaded the Android 15 update the night it became available to me, and the very next night my phone was bricked. I was closing one and then opening another, and then 2 blue static bars appeared near the top of my screen, and everything else was black. The screen was completely unresponsive. I tried resetting it by holding down the Power and Volume Up buttons. After a few seconds, the phone still stayed completely unresponsive EXCEPT for when I would hold down the power button. It would vibrate no matter how fast I was holding down the button repeatedly. It would also vibrate when I hold down Power + Volume Up + Volume Down. I figured I was opening some sort of menu, but I had no idea how to work it because the screen would stay off and unresponsive the entire time. It still vibrates and plays a notification noise whenever one of my alarm times comes up. The only way to turn off the alarm is by restarting the phone by holding the Power Button + Volume Up until it stops vibrating. I can even turn down the volume when the notification noise is playing during the alarm. The thing is, I set it to play a song during alarms, not the factory notification noise. I tried plugging it into my laptop, but my laptop didn't even recognize that a device was plugged into it. I am going to see if I can open the phone, unplug the screen and battery for a few minutes, then plug it back to see if a change is made. I heard some people have trouble with the privacy modes, so I will also try to immediately go to settings and turn that feature off IF the phone even turns on. I am a broke college student and I don't have the money to just get a new phone. My phone worked so well and honestly faster than some new phones my friends got because of the great condition I kept it in. If Google doesn't give me a MAJOR discount or even replace my phone, I am going to be incredibly upset. "

After using both over a few weeks, I don't believe that the smaller Pro model is worth the added cost vs. the base 9.There are only two upgrades on the Pro that I truly appreciated: 1) Telephoto lens, and 2) the Gemini Advanced 1 yr trial w\/ 2TB storage. Even so, I can't say that those are worth +$200 to me.I'd characterize the stated differences in RAM, display specs, brightness, performance and heat management somewhere between negligible to unnoticeable. The thermometer is useless.If you're looking to buy a Pixel this holiday season, and you don't do anything too intensive on your phone, I'd recommend saving the $200 premium, and buying the base Pixel."

            "self_text": "PIXEL 8A REVIEW (not an affiliate)I've been using pixel 8a for a few weeks. So here is my take.1. Camera quality: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- picture quality quite good for midrange phone. I was impressed.- even without editing, the picture looking gorgeous.- to make things even better, can easily remove crowd\/unnecessary objects in the background.2. Adaptive 120Hz display: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- overall it's good.- I can barely see the difference because it's not always on 120Hz.3. Fingerprint responsiveness: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- i would say not the best in the market.- I find hard to unlock the screen as most of the time it didn't recognize my fingerprint.- I had to register the same index fingers 2-3 records to make sure it can recognize mine.- I think it's due to optical sensor, I had use ultrasonic sensor and it's much better and faster.4. sounds quality: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- not the best but overall good.- the sounds attribute for 8a is the sound you heard it quite bassy not loud.5. Performance: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- for a mid range phone I think it's awesome.- 8GB of Ram, make the phone's performance perfoming well.- and for heavy tasks, sometimes it laggy a bit. But not all the time. Maybe have future bugs update.6. Price: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- not that expensive but not that cheap.- but with almost similar 1:1 specs compared with 8 & 8pro, I think it's value buy.7. Pixel exclusive: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50- you can play around with all the features exclusive to the pixel (*some other brands also got it) A) Circle to search: swipe up on the navigation bar to access it. You can use it to translate text on screen or search online.  B) Save pictures from Instagram or Google Images: tap and hold on the image in recents and tap save. C) Smart Reply: automatically suggests replies to your messages. D) Cinematic wallpaper: creates a 3D effect on your wallpaper. E) Scan documents: there's a new scan document button in the camera app. F) You can use your Pixel's camera as a webcam on your computer.G) Cinematic photos: create 3D cinematic videos from your photos. H) Recorder app can transcribe your voice notes, label speakers in recordings, search recordings and turn recordings into videos. I) Audio Emoji: play sound effects during calls. J) Call screen: Pixel can talk to spam callers to find out why they are calling without you having to talk to them. (Not available in Malaysia) K) Clear calling: reduces background noise during calls. L) Best take: helps you choose the perfect pose for every person in a photo. M) Magic eraser: can remove unwanted objects from your photos.     "

With the December drop they fixed the network problems I was experiencing. My device now drops to lte seamlessly when I get into those low signal areas instead of dropping the call or voices cutting out. Now I can say the modem problems have been fixed. Also, the standby time is better than the pixel 8 pro, but overall usage time is the same (6-8 hrs Sot) depending on activities. I'm not a real gamer on my phone. I only play monopoly go. I just wanted to give those an update who read my last review of the device. Edit: They did not fix the modem issues. The update forced the modem to prioritize LTE over 5g. So, now my phone is always on LTE and barely uses 5g in areas that I know it's available. My s24 ultra is on 5g in the same areas the pixel 9 pro XL is on LTE. Hopefully, the pixel 10 pro goes away from Samsung modems entirely. They are not good at these components. "

I knew I would be giving up some software features that I liked on the Pixel as well as losing some camera quality but I thought the excellent battery life and 80w charging would make it worth while.  The battery on the OnePlus 12 lasts through the day every day and the charging is ridiculously fast and I love that. The main thing that is causing me to go back, is the camera. I'm a photographer and I have $15k worth of professional camera gear, but on the day to day, I used my phone to take pictures because its always available in my pocket. It turns out I'm really picky about the camera quality and the pictures from the OnePlus 12 are driving me insane in certain scenarios and I keep on thinking how much better the photo would've been on the Pixel.   It's mainly in high dynamic range scenes, the OnePlus loves blowing out the highlights, so if I'm taking a picture of the sunrise, the shadows will be super bright, and the sky will be white. And while I can try do to exposure compensation, I don't like having to do that every time.   Since I already sold my Pixel, I bought another used one, and I'll plan to upgrade to the Pixel 9 when it comes out in a month in hopes that it resolves some of the issues I have with the Pixel 8, but even if it doesn't, I now know that I'll just have to live with it.  (Samsung would theoretically be a good option for me, but I like unlocking the bootloader on my phones and Samsungs in the US cannot be bootloader unlocked)"

I could automatically tell that this phone feels so premium. The design is so beautiful, the camera quality is so clear, I love the 120 htz display since I've never had a phone that had high refresh rates so I could tell a big difference in screen hertz and this phone is also big as well and perfect. The Google assistant is 100x better than Siri. Honestly I'm complety done with apple. Safe to say that I'm definitely not getting iPhone ever again.

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like? I've used the Google ecosystem of products since day 1 and this is the most frustrated I've been with it's product."

I couldn\u2019t stand the Exynos CPU, battery life, constant overheating and the bloatware-full software that the One UI experience was then.Then I switched to an iPhone 12 in 2021 and everything has gone flawless until late 2023, where I was starting to get frequent overheating and low battery performance. I replaced the battery (it was at 80% health) and I could notice an improvement but it felt quite the same. I really liked that everything on iOS just worked and you don\u2019t have to tweak every single thing down to the last bit in order to get a great experience, that last thing just never happened with the Samsung phones that I owned. But I\u2019m quite bored of the OS and lack of customization and innovation that Apple offers.Now I\u2019m looking to upgrade my phone, as I managed to break the image stabilization of the main camera sensor (image is always out of focus) and the internet modem doesn\u2019t work out of my country as i\u2019m currently on vacation and I\u2019m stuck using 2G for 14 days for no apparent reason  (yes, I could prove it was a hardware\/phone related issue).I value the smoothness of the software, battery and cameras the most, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL manages to hit the sweet spot of all three while having a clean Software experience, but I want to know what has been your experience with Pixels as I\u2019ve never owned one and how well do they age? Have you had any of that buggy Pixel experiences that many people talk about?I\u2019m also waiting for what the iPhone 16 Pro has to offer, but I\u2019m quite sold on the Pixel already.

Some of the iPhone software limitations such as the freaking small ass keyboard (seriously when it's summer God forbid you sweat a little bit because then you can't hit the tiny ass keys they won't let you make bigger) are slowly eating away at my sanity. My airpods pro also recently broke and refuse to charge unfortunately so I'm not locked into the ecosystem or anything. I'm curious about how good is the fingerprint sensor on the 9 Pro and the XL for people who often have dirty\/sweaty fingers (work and genetics yay) and also any quirks people have noticed while using it. I also use Google apps a lot more than iOS ones (YouTube premium, Google photos etc and the fragmentation\/two apps that do the same thing everywhere is really getting on my nerves) As for the AI features i couldn't care less... I wouldn't pay for Gemini advanced unless it gets really good in the future, I just want the assistant to actually understand what damn song i wanna play in the car (unlike Siri who is stuck with the understanding of a potato). The last Android phone I had was the Oneplus 7 Pro with android 10(i think?) And since then I've fallen out of the loop and don't know what new to expect from Android and Google services. When i had an Android I played around a lot with video editing, games, design apps etc and i was wondering if the pixels could keep up? Honestly anything like\/close to what the 12 pro max is giving me performance wise is good enough because the performance on this iPhone has been great. Does the pixel 9 overheat all over the place? I have trauma with another moto phone that constantly overheated... How much longevity can i expect from it? Due to past experiences I'm afraid I'll buy it and it will be a laggy mess in two years, and I'm simply not able to afford upgrading that often and also don't want to be wasteful. For anyone who's read this long essay, thanks for your time and drop any answers\/thoughts below please! I really am looking to catch up with android innovation again"

            "post_title": "Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.",
            "self_text": "Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

Software Problems (OxygenOS)   * Inconsistent UI that feels like a mix between ColorOS, PixelOS, and iOS   * Frequent notification bugs   * Horrible sound quality to external sound devices   * Strayed too far from the original OxygenOS philosophy3. Camera Limitations   * Inconsistent performance   * Subpar low-light photography   * Inaccurate color science**The Good Parts of OnePlus:*** Excellent performance thanks to the Snapdragon chip* Great mobile coverage* Very fast charging (though the 6000mAh battery life is average)**Why I'm Keeping the Pixel:*** More responsive display, especially noticeable during fast typing* Superior camera performance* Consistent PixelOS experience throughout the system* Timely security updates, which is crucial in today's hostile internet environmentI might have kept the OnePlus if they had maintained their original OxygenOS approach and provided timely security updates. Currently, it feels too similar to other Chinese smartphones, losing its unique identity."

The pixel 9 feels better in hand, like a warm blanket. The oneplus is a cold device. It ticks every mark. Battery life is superb, network connectivity is great, display is stunning, but I keep reaching for my P9.The oneplus has its advantages. 1.5day battery life is great. Charging to 100% while am in the shower is amazing. I have no battery anxiety with this phone. P9 is a 18hr phone. And it charges so slowly that I have to leave it plugged overnight, lest I wake up  with a dying battery.The display on the OP13 is really good. The colors vivid. the P9 has a very weird issue with screen brightness sometimes where it goes very dim in shaded areasThe cooling performance is worlds apart. I have never felt the OP13 overheat. The p9 starts overheating immediately I connect to Android Auto (OP13 doesnt have android auto yet)Cameras the pixel 9 shines, although I think the OP13 has also really good shots. I am not a big camera afficianado, so I would say they both have good photos compared side by side.  In summary, the OP13 has my cold logical mind. The P9 has my heart"

            "self_text": "**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."

            "self_text": "Currently been using the Pixel Pro 9 for a week after having been in IOS for 10 years, iPhone 13PM. This would be the most basic review and all comparisons\/things said are just my opinions. The phone is greatly designed. The circular camera at the front is noticable but only bc I'm used to the 13PM's bezzle. The back camera bump is unique and different. I feel refreshing to see another design besides Apples and Samsungs. I am rocking the 9 Pro XL in hazel and i really dig the color. Saw obsidian at my local best buy but hazel was different and subtle. The phones build is in my opinion the best looking pixel that looks and feels premium. But that can also be just bc of it's resemblance to the iPhone that have been looking at for the past 10!years.Screen looks slower and not as fluid as my 13PM. It wouldn't be a big deal to me if this phone wasn't 3 years newer than my 13PM so it kinda rubs me the wrong way knowing that the screen on my 13 PM is as good as the Pixel pro 9. Auto dimmer can make the screen a bit too dark for me at times. But that is a whole other issue.Modem is alright. I work in a building with 4 floors and I'm in the 3rd. Calls and messages are great. Social media and Internet usage can be a bit delayed. Alot of people say that it's a big upgrade but I feel that my iPhone was able to get me signal from most places including my 3rd floor office. Watching videos on social media lags out a bit at times. Idk if it's a user error but when on X and watching videos they lag or just stop. I have to press play and the video plays for 12 seconds then stops again. I just close the app, I haven't tried looking for a real solution bc frankly I can careless. Battery life i am still determining just bc I have had the phone for a week so it is still adjusting to my habits and battery usage. But for the first weeks it's been, alright. I'm a dad, I start my day at 430 am and end it around 9-10 pm. From 430 to 7am I'm getting up and going to the gym, by 7am my phone was at 90% starting from a full charge. By 1 pm, my phone is at 55% with just using it for texting my wife, light scrolling, and playing music\/podcasts in the background. So compared to my 13 PM the battery has been weaker. But like I said, Pixel is still adjusting to my battery usage. Camera is alright. Some pictures look better and others look better on the 13PM. Various of the new \"upgrades\" that are AI based are in early stages. Doesn't really catch my attention and due to them being early stage roll outs they don't make it into a considerations of an upgrade. Magic eraser isn't new but it works alright. Pixel studio is cool and I get the idea but it seems like iOS will be having somethings similar. Video is def better on the 13PM. Just can't argue that one lol camera is good pretty good overall , especially if your camera isn't the buying point Android software is cool, very customizable and open to work with. Def better than IOSProbably a bunch of other things I haven't mentioned but it's just a small glimpse to the phone.Overall I think it's a great phone but IDK if it's worth upgrading FOR ME just bc I don't feel like most of the upgrades are not really full on upgrades."

First of all, I'm totally new to all of this and very much a newb, so any help is much appreciated and any info and advice that you give me couldn't possibly be too detailed.So I've watched tutorials and read through some guides on how to downgrade the android version using Android SDK and ADB (https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/12\/16\/how-to-downgrade-from-android-13-to-android-12-on-google-pixel\/), and it all seems doable so far. I know that for the Google Pixel 4XL I need to download one of the factory images from \"coral\". My only issue is that every tutorial I've watched specifically warned to be very careful when choosing the factory image and that it is crucial to know the correct build to download for which phone, but it is never specified anywhere which exact version of the factory image that I need to download from Google's site. I've seen many people online saying that they've tried one build or another and it ended up destroying their phone one way or another, so I wanna make sure that I got that right before I end up doing even more damage than I set out to repair.How do I know which from the following factory images for Android 12 to download and to flash?

Not all devices are affected. Pixel 4a 5G devices explicitly listed as unaffected. Google is offering a few \"appeasements\" to try and fix their mistake.Appeasement options (choose 1): * Battery Replacement* $50 USD (or local equivalent) payment.* $100 USD (or local equivalent) Google hardware discount code applicable towards the purchase of another Pixel phone on the Google Store (as available).---Personally I've been using Android 13 in beta for the last 3 weeks on my Pixel 4a and it has truly made my phone unusable if I'm not next to a charger. I've been carrying around a large battery bank with me in my pocket just to get through the day. I honestly thought I must have dropped it or done something to it physically to cause such degradation to the battery. Kinda glad to know that's not the case. I'm still trying to determine if I want to get the $50 cash or chose the $100 store credit towards a new Pixel. It is interesting to note that at the time of this post the Pixel 4a trade in value is $120.  With the store credit and trade in you would get $220 towards a new Pixel."

            "post_title": "After 14 Years of iPhone, I Finally Switched to Android: My One-Month Review of the Pixel 9",
            "self_text": "Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"

That seems like a pretty good deal, doesn\u2019t it?The S24 Ultra costs $1,270 without a mobile plan, making it significantly more expensive.I tried switching to Android when the Galaxy S10 was new. I kept it for two weeks before going back to the iPhone.For those of you who\u2019ve switched from an iPhone to a Pixel, are you happy with it? What do you miss?

Pretty significant upgrade -- except that I've been bitten by a reasonably well-documented Bluetooth bug that, according to my research, affects Android 14 & 15.With the P9P, not all of the BT devices I use will pair.  Some pair just fine, others can be seen by the phone but won't connect, and others can't even be seen at all.  I've spent more hours on this than I'd like to admit and I've tried all of the remedies suggested... resetting the BT & WiFi settings, adjusting the various settings in Developer Options (eg., changing AVRCP & MAP versions, disabling LE and A2DP), clearing caches, and even factory resetting the phone.  It's frustrating, but honestly I could just forget about it if it weren't for the fact that my car is one of the devices that won't pair.I'm apparently not alone with this issue; it's pretty well documented on the Internet.  It seems to be an issue with Android 14 & 15, and I skated by until now because my 4a was on Android 13.  I confirmed the same behavior by testing my devices on a P8a running Android 14.So, I have two questions that I'm hoping will help inform my next steps:1. Does this issue affect Android 14 & 15 on other manufacturers' devices?  Ie., if I switched to a Samsung device should I expect to see the same behavior?  I've searched and seen almost no evidence that Samsung devices have this issue2. Does Google publish any sort of roadmap that shows what bugs will be addressed and when -- or if at all?Big thanks in advance for any feedback!"

Google was no help as they blamed the provider, even though it was obviously a software issue.  My son needed a phone so moved on to a new one, while we hoped that a future software update would fix the connectivity issue.  The phone was updated but there was no fix.  Android 15 was eventually rolled out and the issue remained.  I recently acquired the phone from him and did what I suggested to him back when the issue first came about and there was no fix in sight...I flashed Android 13 back on the device.  The cellular connection was restored and I'm currently typing on the device which is no longer a broken phone.   I hope this helps anyone who might still be looking for a fix after all of this time.  Shame on Google for not taking responsibility for their software causing this issue.  I've read that some people were able to receive repair or replacement after months of dealing with Google, though many others like my son were left with a useless phone.  Before flashing Android 13, I reached out to Google again about the issue and was told that it was the SIM card tray\/slot and that it would be a $400+ repair since it was out of warranty!  I can't be more disappointed in a company as I am in Google support.  I will reach out to them one more time, now that I know the phone works on 13 and see what they have to say but I'm not holding my breath for any help from them. Thanks for listening to my rant and I hope that it helps someone along the way. TIL: Android 14 update broke Pixel 7 Pro.  No cellular connection.  Flashed Android 13 and connection was restored.

I will amend this post if the issue returns.* Many owners of pixel phones within the 7 range (including my 7a) have been experiencing issues with voice calls since the initial Android 14 update. This has mainly involved the phone acting as if mute is being triggered on and off, resulting in the user's voice dropping off intermittently throughout the call. It also can result in audio of the other caller dropping in or out to.Despite many of us having this issue, Google have not recognised it, nor have they issues a fix for it. The only thing that seems to reliably fix the issue for most of us is to roll back to Android 13. This indicates that it is a software issue rather than a hardware issue. When I took this to Google, I was granted an RMA and I sent the phone off for two weeks to a repair centre. Two weeks after the phone returned, the issue returned too. So, I am among many others with my phone rolled back to Android 13 hoping a future update will fix this so that I can have a working phone and am protected from vulnerabilities.There have been many[ threads devoted to this issue](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/search\/?q=voice+calls+drop+android+14+update&type=link&cId=5e3445e4-d907-4e44-8be4-7b572140c54a&iId=f133920f-deae-4cc8-9e9f-e07835acaa69) but most of us kept each other up to date via[ this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/173576t\/google_pixel_7_pro_drop_calls_after_android_14\/).

After carefully considering what we would like to see in this update, I have put together a list of features that I believe would be truly impressive and essential.  *(What else would you add to the list?)*1. **Refining Artificial Intelligence Functions:** This update should include enhancements to AI capabilities, as some features are not yet working optimally. For instance, voice dictation currently fails to insert punctuation or separate paragraphs correctly (so far, the best experience I've had is with Windows). Additionally, it would be ideal if real-time translation worked in external applications, such as social media, and if significant improvements were made to photo editing tools.2. **Enhanced Customization:** I would love to see more personalization options that add extra utility while retaining the essence of pure Android. For example, having wallpapers change automatically would be fantastic, improving upon the current option that only uses backgrounds provided by Google.What additional features would you like to see in Android 16?

(Could anyone clarify which AI features are\/aren\u2019t available in the Czech Republic?)# iPhone 16:* Price: $950.* Most people around me use iPhones, so I\u2019d benefit from features like iMessage and AirDrop.* I\u2019m not tied to the Apple ecosystem (I don\u2019t own an iPad, Mac, or AirPods).* I use exclusive Apple apps like AirDrop or FaceTime only a few times a year.* I\u2019m unsure if Apple\u2019s AI features will be fully available and functional in my region \u2013 and whether they\u2019ll live up to the hype.# What I\u2019m Looking For:* I\u2019m impressed by the AI capabilities of both phones.* I want a phone that will last 5+ years. I don\u2019t play demanding games; I primarily use my phone for productivity, social media, etc.What are your thoughts? Any advice or insights, especially about AI features and long-term usability for either phone, would be greatly appreciated.I will be posting this on both Goodle and Apple subreddits to get opinion of both groups.Thank you very much everyone!"

            "self_text": "Fellows, I have been enjoying my Pixel 8a for around a month, but I still think there are a couple of features that Google should improve. In my case, if I were the Product Owner, I'd like to try to focus on three topics:1. **Complete the freefloating form feature.** I have tested it, and for me, it was something I actually missed from my old Oppo A91. It seems almost ready, but I cannot overlap apps in my phone. Maybe it's a bug, but I would rather this than the Bubbles for all.2. **Improve the video camera.** I went to Sweden to see the Northern Lights and the [results](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/DD6kIEPtQEj\/?img_index=1) were better than I expected. However, the videos were terrible. I could barely see anything.3. **Allow double-tap to lock.** Several phones have it including my old Huawei.I have also some nice to have:* Bring back the tiles for Data and WiFi or at least, give us the developers the right to the dirty job. I know it's controversial, but I'd like to have them.* Allow the phone to be scheduled when to turn it on or off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow the Alarm to turn on the phone if it's off. My old Oppo has it.* Allow swiping actions like the three fingers for taking screenshots. My old Oppo has it.Maybe you have other ideas or agree with mine. I prefer to focus on specific features that, if we're lucky, the Android\/Pixel product owner might hear us out about before they dive deeper into development of things that we might not like or agree with their \"research\". Plus, if we just rely on sending feedback through the app, I find it often ends up on deaf ears.Have amazing holidays."

The Apple presentation feels fake, CGI and AI generated.* Besides that, Apple showed a lot more hardware and software novelties than Google. The hardware makes a lot better impression. The Pixel 9 Pro should have no chance against the iPhone 16 Pro when it comes to processing power and things like 4K 120 FPS recording. The audio mixing with the new microphones could be awesome. I like the new camera button. That's as cool as the capacitive fingerprint sensor that allowed us to drag down the notification bar until Pixel 5.* Google focused entirely on Gemini, while Apple showed many other interesting software features. I really like the new photo, video and audio recording and editing features they showed. They added some things our Pixel phones already have for many years. * I don't know if this is because Google wants to focus on Gemini or because Google doesn't have the new Android version yet but I'm a bit worried that the new Android version won't come with that many new software features. At the same time Gemini isn't as good as GPT here so the Apple Intelligence combined with the free access to GPT seems much better.* The Pixel 9 (128 GB) costs 899\u20ac in Germany, the iPhone 16 (128 GB) costs 949\u20ac here.* The Pixel 9 Pro (128 GB) costs 1099\u20ac, the iPhone 16 Pro (128 GB) costs 1199\u20ac here.* I would say the iPhone 16 has a much better price performance ratio than the Pixel 9. Even after the trade in deals."

I also work on Mac. The iPhone 16 Pro is a nice device. I feel it\u00b4s more fluid than my actual Pixel 8 Pro, and without some annoyances, being:\\- Occasional stuttering when scrolling on X\/Twitter or some other feeds.\\- Password Manager autofill not working reliable (Bitwarden). I\u00b4ve tried Proton Pass and same result. \\- Portrait mode is bad, even editing afterwards in Google Photos, or at least not as good as iPhone.\\- Whatsapp calling not turning off the screen, causing false screen touches. Very annoying. All my calls are within Whatsapp. All of the above work flawlessly on the iPhone, at least in my last 3 weeks with it. However, I miss all the rest my Pixel has, like:\\- Notifications control, like sending to Watch Later directly from the YouTube notification, and how Android treats notifications in all. \\- Keyboard GBoard\\- AI features\\- Back Gesture\\- Camara is better, at least color rendering. I\u00b4m going back and forth on my decision if keeping the iPhone (which also means Airpods and Watch), or keeping my old love with Pixel and going for the 9 Pro. "

I was very sceptical but decided to just give it a shot for a week atleast.Today I received it and went through the migration process etc, there were some quirks but to be expected, especially with Google Account and Gemini integration. Then i saw that when you **restart** the phone, you **lose all notifications**.... why? how is that something that happens with no way of fixing...Still kept trying it until I went to play some audio on Spotify... and damn the audio is complete garbage for a high end phone... And I did try Youtube videos and just playing audio on the browser and the same experience happened. That was enough for me to decide to not switch over to the Pixel.  Took me 3 hours... Im actually very disappointed never expected for the audio to be the deciding factor.Even comparing with the Samsung you can see such a big difference in a Youtube video (imagine in person): [https:\/\/youtu.be\/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs\\_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DnvbAAKlT3s?si=XcRs_gcuN5AL2V38&t=540)The end, love you all <3 PS: for those who like the audio on the Pixel, everyone has different preferences and this is mine."

I used the phone for 6 months before passing it on to my wife to use and she's been using it ever since. The other day, after 16 months, I was taking the case off the phone to apply a new screen protector for my wife and the case broke at the section that covers the edges of the phone where the camera visor meets the side of the phone - the thinnest part of the case. For context, I create tech-related content on YouTube, and created a load of videos about the Pixel 8, so when I was filming, I would be taking the phone out of its case more frequently than the average user would, but it's clear that this section of the case is vulnerable to breaking if flexed too often!I guess this is more of a PSA for anyone who is using the Pixel 8 with the official case, or is thinking of picking one up - if you are taking the case off, remove the case from the bottom of the phone rather than the top, and you shouldn't encounter this issue!Other than that issue, I really liked the official case - it was grippy, and seemed to protect the phone really well. I recommended my wife try the Spigen Liquid Air case for the Pixel 8 and it just arrived the other day and seems to be a similarly grippy and nice case, without the design flaw of the official case.Anyone else encountered the same issue with the P8 official case?"

The pros are obvious and stated by other users here as well as on CNET, Wired, CNET, etc.\u00a0On the flip side, the phone has fallen victim to the same fallacy affecting other first-generation novelties - focusing on the breakthrough feature but sacrificing both basic features associated with a smartphone. Moreover, the Fold (even when compared to the Galaxy) is quite rudimentary and lfalls short with heuristics that define the user experience interacting with a table-type phone.* Battery - Terrible as always. I\u2019ve never had a Pixel phone where I didn\u2019t have the battery saver on by defaults nd it still dies within 3\/4 of my day without charge* No good case - Even , the front portion of the case easily loses its adhesiveness around the 2-3 mm border. This is more of an issue with the case, but the design of the phone itself does not allow for an appropriate case for the front panel* Front panel - Very difficult to backwards swipe to go to a previous web page when viewing in a broswer- will usually just translate to the next Home Screen panel * Fold display - this clearly a first draft and I wish I had waited for the third. So many issues:   * Screen takes 2-3 seconds to \u201cturn on\u201d when unfolding the phone   * Google tries very hard to describe the two panel feature, but it is FAR from self-explanatory. Moreover, even basic apps from Google do not function properly, with many text-entry app functions missing the keyboard for swipe or text (forcing me to fold the phone to the single display to have the keyboard pop up)   * Several apps will take up 1.t5 screens   * They keyboard, when it appears, has a humungous gap in the keyboard between the panels, making swype inefficient and unusable* Incompatibility between Gmail and Dropbox - this apparently is an issue for all Google \/ Android phones* Ongoing Android\/iPhone MMS disconnect - leading to granular video appearing when Apple and Android users are together on MMS* Unlocked phones have data reconnecrtivity issues after switching to Wi-Fi for calling (no signal) but then having an issue with the Wi-Fi at the location itself. After a couple hours, once you leave the dead zone area and return to 5G\/LTE areas, the phone can take hours to reconnect to Verizon. Even with toggling Airplane mode, SIM card, and multiple restarts* Awkward tapping of the rear horizontal camera panel to take a screenshot - absolutely inconsistent and clumsy * Significant lag in accessing text messages especially when you have multiple years of conversations stored)* Camera quality IMHO took a hit compared to Pixel 6 and predecessors* Verizon general signal issues."

            "post_title": "Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.",
            "self_text": "Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"

            "self_text": "There's a lot of info floating around about how to optimally charge the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I happen to have a USB tester, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and an assortment of chargers, including the official Google charger, the Ugreen Nexode 65W, and a bunch of other randos.First, please realize that the max reported charge is only available when the phone has very low battery, and it is reasonably cool. As the phone heats up, and as the battery increases in charge, the charging is intentionally slowed down. Officially, Google claims up to 70% charge in 30 minutes, with the following glorious fine print:>Fast wired charging rates (up to 27W on Pixel 9, up to 27W on Pixel 9 Pro, and up to 37W on Pixel 9 Pro XL) are based upon use of the Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. Adapters sold separately. Charging speed based upon testing with device batteries drained to 1% and charged with Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger. Charging testing conducted by Google in early 2024 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings with the device powered on. Charging speed depends upon many factors including usage during charging, battery age, and ambient temperature. Actual charging speed may be slower.With that in mind, here's what I've found.# Official Google ChargerPhone is at 38%, the charger pushed 17.5V, 1.96A -> 34.3W. Close to the published max of 37W, it's probably held back because I'm at 38%. When I get a chance, I'll drain the battery completely and see what we get. [https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd](https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd)# UGreen Nexode 65WThis charger supports all the appropriate specs... It  has Power Delivery (aka PD), Programmable Power Supply (aka PPS) up to 21V. This *should* have been just as good as the official charger. Unfortunately, it was not to be... Like above, with the phone at 38%, we get 8.92V, 2.91A -> 26.0W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB)The charging cable I used above was a run-of-the-mill cable, only rated to 3A. I figured it's worth trying with a 5A rated cable. Unfortunately, we got the same results: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK)# Random Amazon Basics 65W chargerThis charger does not support PPS, so I was expecting something similar to the UGreen. It did settle in at the 9V range, but interestingly the current was kept near 2A, despite being capable of pushing 3A @ 9V. Actual output: 9.15V, 2.13A -> 19.5W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D)Just in case, I used the higher amp cable, but it wasn't needed - the negotiated current was kept under 3A.# Previous Google Phone ChargerI think it was from my 6a. On the adapter it said max 9V, 2A, and indeed that's what it pushed. Specifically 9.17V, 1.94A -> 17.8W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7)# ConclusionsGiven my chargers, only the official Google one could max out the phone. I'm really not sure why the UGreen didn't - and frankly a bit disappointed in the purchase. Still, it was about 50% better than the non-PPS enabled chargers. Speaking of non-PPS enabled chargers, it looks like they top out at \\~9V and \\~2A, which is about half the charging ability of the native Google charger.I have read that there's an Anker charger that can manage full speeds. I have also read that a full-speed charger needs to support PPS up to 21V, and that 20V chargers wouldn't get there. But that seems odd to me considering the max charge I saw with the Google charger occurred at under 18V.That's all I got for now. If I get any more chargers, I'll add them here."

I\u2019m sick and tired of people and Apple claiming the iPhones having world fastest chip and way ahead of the competition when the reality is that the software cannot keeps up with the hardware. I am now planning for a switch to the Google Pixel purely because I want a smoother software experience, to me software is everything for a phone. I do not care about specs on a sheet. Does the pixel have any stutters, does it sometimes not work at 120hz? Tell me about the fluidity and general user experience. Show me the light at the end of the tunnel. "

They said that their was nothing they could do. However do to this post a different google agent messaged me. They were able to help me after going to the authorized repair shop 3x times. The motherboard was also damaged apparently and they guessed it was from the battery or vice versa. Make sure that you get it in writing a repair report even if they did not do a repair. I tried to get other documentation but google support did not accept it and cause me to go to the repair shop several times.  Anyway the whole phone would have to be replaced.

The Pixel A series uses a tensor chip with the same name as the main series. For example, the Pixel 6a uses the Tensor G1, which is almost identical to the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.However, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were released in October 2021, while the 6a was released in the middle of the following year, in July 2022. This timeframe difference is similar for the 7a and 8a. This creates an interesting point in terms of Android version upgrades: starting with Android 16, new Android versions will be released in the first quarter (Q1) of each year.Because of this, the Pixel A series will receive one more update than the mainstream series.For example, the Pixel 6 Pro will be supported until October 2026, so it will receive updates up to Android 17. However, Pixel 6a will be supported until July 2027, so it will receive Android 18 update. Considering that the Pixel A series usually has the same or lower specs as the main models, having one more Android update may seem like a contradiction to some users. This raises the question of whether Google will stick to its guns and only give the A series one more Android update, or whether the main series will also get one more update beyond the stated support period. Considering that Google has given one or two updates beyond the stated support period in the past, it might not be out of the question to give the mainstream models one more update beyond the support period. However, in the case of the Pixel 6\/7 series, support has already been extended once beyond the originally promised timeframe, so it wouldn't be surprising if they don't update them. It'll be interesting to see how Google handles this. What are your thoughts about this?"

When charging, it will stay at a certain percent for hours and then randomly be back at 100% when I check again. I initially started the process to replace the battery for free. Google provided stores close to my location to bring it to. I called beforehand to check to make sure they had everything and was told they would also have to charge $140 for a screen replacement. I then decided to pursue the $100 store credit option which is where my question originates from.

Its more or less unusable at the moment as it either lags behind by 30-45s or just loses GPS connection altogether when I'm driving. Its not an app specific issue as two separate GPS satellite tracker apps show zero connections to satellites (and resetting GPS data doesn't help) when I'm having problems. All location services settings\/permissions are enabled properly.It works periodically but requires restarting the phone, then \\~50% of time I get excellent satellite connectivity (\\~17 fixed) but it loses all GPS connectivity after driving for a few minutes. Also strangely, disabling location permissions on android auto (which I never use) also restores GPS connections but only temporarily. This is independent of the mobile connection fwiw. This issue only appeared recently for me, in particular after the September update. I was in Europe (I live in Canada) at the time and the phone auto-updated. It was mostly fine in Europe but since I got back home, the GPS has been quite bad. There's a ton of other reports for the pixel 6 and 7 from other users experiencing GPS issues (though it seems to be driven by the June update for them). Note that flashing an older firmware\/update version seems to fix the issue for them.For the reasons above, I'm fairly sure its a software related issue however and (hopefully) not due to faulty hardware. So has anyone with the Pixel 6\/7\/8 line phones with these issues managed to fix the problem by updating to Android 15? I'm hesitant to test it myself bc there's also reports of A15 bricking some older models. If this GPS issue isn't fixed in the next week or so I want to take advantage of BF sales and buy a new phone. Hence why Im asking here, I would trade in the P7P and can't do that if its bricked. Thanks!"

            "self_text": "Looking for advice on what to do in this situation!  I have a Google Pixel 8 and was having issues with the screen turning green ranging anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Nothing I did would help it go back to normal, I just had to wait it out. I contacted Google Support about it and the rep let me know I was eligible for the Extended Repair Program. He said I had to get the phone repaired from UBreakIFix and email them the receipt and they would refund it (I have this written in an email from Google Support from December 17).Now after sending my receipt, they are saying it actually isn't covered by the Extended Repair Program and they won't refund me the cost of the repairs. Now they just keep trying to offer me a \"20% discount on my next Pixel device\".  I wouldn't have gotten the phone fixed (they completely replaced my screen) for over $200 if I wasn't told it would be refunded from Google Support. I would have just dealt with the periodic green screen, but now I am out the money. How can they tell me it is eligible for the extended repair and then retract that statement only after the phone was repaired? What can I do? "

The issue isn't about signal strength or switching between Wi-Fi and cellular - I just need the phone to stay connected to a Wi-Fi network that intentionally doesn't provide internet access.Has anyone successfully set up a similar device?

I'll be helping you today.[5:57:54 PM] Me: Me joined the conversation[5:57:58 PM] [Support rep]: Just want to make sure our connection works.I'm here to help.[5:58:34 PM] Me: I'm attempting to perform initial setup of a Viofo A229 dashcam which requires connecting to the dashcam's local Wi-Fi network to use the Viofo app for configuration. When I connect to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network (VIOFO-A229-XXXX), my Pixel 8 detects there is no internet access and automatically disconnects within seconds, making it impossible to complete the setup process through the app. I've tried adjusting the Wi-Fi settings available under Network & Internet, but haven't found a way to force the phone to maintain the connection despite the lack of internet access. The dashcam is powered on and broadcasting its network, and I can see the network in my Wi-Fi list, but cannot maintain a connection long enough to configure the device.[5:58:58 PM] [Support rep]: Thank you for the detailed information.[6:03:48 PM] [Support rep]: I can understand that you cant access the wifi network to install and use the above mentioned app.[6:06:05 PM] Me: To clarify: The phone successfully connects to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network, but disconnects automatically within seconds because it detects no internet access. I need to maintain this connection briefly to configure the dashcam, even without internet access.[6:06:27 PM] [Support rep]: Thank you for the information.[6:06:44 PM] [Support rep]: Let me check the connectivity issues if any.[6:09:51 PM] [Support rep]: May I know if you are currently within the US?[6:10:08 PM] Me: Yes[6:10:46 PM] Me: May I ask how this is germaine to the issue at hand?[6:12:04 PM] [Support rep]: I can't understand your above point.[6:12:22 PM] [Support rep]: It seems that your Pixel 8 is automatically disconnecting from the dashcam's Wi-Fi network because it can't establish an internet connection. This is likely due to the nature of local Wi-Fi networks, which often don't provide internet access.[6:14:38 PM] Me: The dashcam creates its own Wi-Fi network. My Pixel 8 connects to it, but then immediately disconnects because it expects internet access. The dashcam's Wi-Fi isn't meant to have internet - it's just for setup. I need my phone to stay connected long enough to configure the dashcam.[6:17:50 PM] [Support rep]: Google Fi always looks for the strongest signal available. When both Google Fi network and Wi-Fi are present, the only way to have a \"pure Wi-Fi\" experience is to turn on Airplane Mode in the device settings, which forces the phone to only use Wi-Fi.[6:19:39 PM] Me: The issue isn't about signal strength or choosing between Wi-Fi and cellular data. The problem is that my Pixel 8 won't stay connected to any Wi-Fi network that doesn't have internet access. The dashcam creates a Wi-Fi network specifically for setup, and it's not supposed to have internet. Even with airplane mode on, the phone still disconnects because it's detecting 'no internet' on the Wi-Fi connection. I need a way to tell my phone it's okay to stay connected to a Wi-Fi network that doesn't provide internet access.[6:22:42 PM] [Support rep]: - Check for Updates: Ensure your Pixel 8 is running the latest software version. Sometimes, software updates can fix connectivity issues.- Reset the Dashcam:Factory Reset: If none of the above solutions work, you might try resetting the dashcam to its factory settings. Refer to the dashcam's user manual for specific instructions.[6:23:02 PM] Me: Thank you for this information and have a nice day.[6:24:57 PM] [Support rep]: You're welcome.[6:25:04 PM] [Support rep]: Is there anything else I may assist you with?[6:25:09 PM] Me: No[6:25:15 PM] [Support rep]: It was a pleasure chatting with you.[6:25:20 PM] [Support rep]: Have a great day![6:25:28 PM] Me: You as well take care.[6:27:59 PM] [Support rep]: [Support rep] left the conversation```Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

            "post_title": "Google Support Saga: Agents Hang Up, Fall Asleep, and My Store Credit is MIA",
            "self_text": "Hey Reddit,I\u2019ve been a loyal Google customer for years, but the past week has been such a mess with Google Support that I just have to share. I\u2019m not sure whether to laugh or cry at this point, but maybe you all can help me figure it out.**The Issue:**  I ordered a Pixel 9 on August 20, thinking everything was smooth sailing. The total came to $658.89 after applying $319.90 in store credits from a previous purchase (Pixel 9 Pro XL). According to the order summary, I was supposed to get $165.89 back in store credits\u2014$100 from the Pixel 9 offer and $65.89 from my Google One 10% benefit. Got the $100, no problem. But the $65.89? Poof, it disappeared into the Google void.Now, here\u2019s where it gets tricky: Before buying the Pixel 9, I got the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which came with a free trial of Google One AI Premium. But\u2014plot twist\u2014I\u2019ve been a Google One 2TB member for over a year, which gives me the 10% credit (that I received just a couple of days earlier!). In May, I activated a two-month trial of Google One AI Premium, which pushed my membership expiration to October. Fast forward to August 22, I activated the free one-year trial, which somehow reset my membership, moving my next billing date to August 22, 2025, instead of October 8, 2025. This is a whole other issue with Google support, but here\u2019s the kicker: Google now thinks I\u2019ve only been a Google One member since August 22, which means they wrongly decided I wasn\u2019t eligible for the 10% credit when I bought the Pixel 9 on August 20. *Facepalm*.**The Wild Ride:**1. **August 25th:** I started a chat with Google Support, thinking this would be a quick fix. They confidently told me, \u201cJust wait 24-72 hours, and it\u2019ll be sorted.\u201d Silly me for believing that.2. **August 28th:** Things went off the rails.   * **2:51 PM:** An agent tells me I\u2019ll get a resolution within \u201ca couple of hours.\u201d Great!   * **3:17 PM:** Another agent swoops in to say, \u201cActually, you\u2019ll get it tomorrow.\u201d Because why not?   * **6:22 PM:** I call back, determined to get this resolved. When I ask for a supervisor, the agent refuses, says she can no longer help me, and then *hangs up* on me without listening to anything I had to say. Customer service at its finest.   * **6:33 PM:** Not one to be easily defeated, I call again. This time, the agent must\u2019ve been having a really rough day, because he was *literally asleep* and snoring on the line. I have the recording to prove it. I guess they\u2019re just that relaxed over at Google Support.   * **6:37 PM:** Finally, I get through to a supervisor named Alex. He actually listens and stays awake\u2014small victories\u2014but then drops the bomb: he\u2019s the \u201clast point of contact.\u201d Apparently, I\u2019ve reached the end of the line, and there\u2019s no one else to speak with.**Emails:**  I also sent follow-up emails on August 27 and 28, trying to be professional and all. What did I get? Nothing but radio silence, followed by the usual \u201cWait another 48-72 hours\u201d script. At this point, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re stalling just to see how long I\u2019ll hold out.**Why I\u2019m Posting:**  I\u2019m frustrated, exhausted, and a little bit in disbelief. Google Support has turned a simple $65.89 credit into a week-long saga that involved being hung up on, dealing with a sleeping agent, and getting the runaround from one agent to another. I\u2019ve spent thousands with Google over the years, and this is the service I get?I\u2019m sharing this to see if anyone else has had similar experiences or advice on how to deal with this madness. I\u2019m also considering filing a formal complaint with the BBB and taking this story to other platforms. Might as well go all the way, right?**TL;DR:** Google Support has been dragging me around for days over a simple store credit issue. I\u2019ve been hung up on, had an agent fall asleep on me, and still haven\u2019t seen my $65.89 credit. I\u2019m fed up, but not giving up."

            "self_text": "I work in IT, Lives in India, Owns Pixel 7 Pro and never had a love-hate relationship with a phone like this. Sure, it's just a phone. But when it is involved with your every day Work it is more than that, it's like a palm computer that you have to rely on.I am very much looking forward for the Pixel 9 Pro XL even though my 7 pro is just 18 months old. I am so1. Tired of Battery:The phone just Lasts 16,17 hours with a 4-5 hours SOT with Wifi.  An hour of SOT is reduced if used with a mix of Wifi-Mobile data. There are days i rely very much on apps like Teams, outlook, slack and phone calls. The phone could not keep up at all and just drops battery like crazy. The cherry on the top is a sweet 100 minutes charging time.2. Thermals:The phone easily reaches 40\u00b0c even with a slight usage of phone calls, social media outside with the mobile data. The phone instantly starts to drop frames like a samsung midranger. \ud83d\ude113. Phone call drops:Never in my life i have missed so much calls or OTPs. It's quite embarrassing that other phones used in my household even with unreliable phone network like Jio never drop calls. I use Airtel which has quite a good coverage at my location. This is fixed for some extent sincr june but definitely happens atleast once or twice a week. Turning on\/off airplane mode is the workaround.4. Stutters and scrolling issues:The main feature that attracts users to pixel phone is the clean software experience. The phone with supposedly no bloatwares has stutters, lags littered everywhere. You don't notice it frequently but when it happens it is quite annoying. don't get me started with the poor scrolling experience not just with third party apps but even with Google apps.I believe the whole point of \"Only Phone engineered by Google\" is to have a top notch optimization. But that's definitely not the case.5. Camera:This is not related to my other complaints.Yes, even though the pixel is hailed as a camera king that is definitely not the case. It is good only with still photos. It lacks so much in,Video quality - The panning or slight shake results in a choppy videoLens transition - It is so so Bad. Especially the telephoto lens take a second to kick in. Other phones does a much better job.Portrait mode - This mode is useless and can be removed tbh. This rarely does a decent job and the images are always a overporcessed mess.Blue tone - for some reason, the color shades of light green, peacock green, teal, cyan turns out as blue regardless of the lighting. This is quite an annoying processing.I am looking forward to see if 9 Pro XL addresses these issues at least to an extent because i don't want to leave my favourite Smartphone software experience."

            "self_text": "Hey Pixel fam,Yesterday was my 40th birthday, and my girlfriends threw me a surprise party. I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive. They suggested waiting until Monday so it would be cheaper - around \u20ac500, especially if it\u2019s on the route of the maintenance guy. So here\u2019s my dilemma \u2013 should I take the risk and pay to retrieve it, hoping it\u2019s still alive and functional, or leave it there and cut my losses? It\u2019s a brand-new, expensive phone, but \u20ac500 is a lot of money if it\u2019s completely broken\u2026What would you all do? Anyone else ever been through this? Could my protective gear have saved my Pixel 9 Pro?[lift shaft ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TZTSg3a.png)Update #1:Spend 1 hour with my magnet on a stick to poke around the shaft, but it's way deeper than my stick could reach. Tried to use my flashlight on every side to see if it's on the ground somewhere, but was unable to spot it. I think I was able to see only 5% of the whole area.I'll make some calls tomorrow to the building manager and the lift shaft maintenance company!Update#2I tried for 2 days to get contact with the company that does the maintenance. Called like 5-10 times. They would call back etc, but never did.Last time I called I said: \"I've read about a fire hazard risk, because the Li-on battery could be broken and explode in a few days, I've read about this online, could you add this to the ticket and let your supervisor know about this?\".Looks like that worked, because they will be at the building this week!Update #3Today was maintainance day and they found the phone. They will hand it over to me tomorrow. But they already made a picture and video and told us it was completely crushed, not working etc. I'll post the pics when I have it! And a complete rapport tomorrow.Update #4The video [The Video of the pixel 9 pro after the 20 Stories fall](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YAS4V0x.mp4)"

            "post_title": "80% of American teens buy iPhones. After I switched to Pixel, I'm convinced Samsung is why.",
            "self_text": "People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side."

            "self_text": "Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?"

So if I charge it everyday, the battery might have degraded to 80% of the maximum capacity after 4 years (This number is just a guess, but I would even say it is better).So if I turn on this 80% feature, I basically have a worse battery from day 1. And if I use it, should I turn this feature off after around 2 years to counteract the degraded battery?Moreover, all the websites praising this feature say that a 80% charge is enough for a whole day anyways, but if that is the case, I can just use my battery at 100% and after 4 years (when it is degraded to 80%) it will be still enough for a whole day.Am I missing something?I really like the battery at 100% as there are sometimes situations where I spontaniously need an extra day of charge and might have limited access to charging.I know that I just came up with the value (20% battery degradation in 4 years) but from my previous phones I never experienced such a loss even after 4 years, or do I highly underestimate an averrrage capacity loss over the years?Do you have different experiences? Or is this feature for someone who wants to use their phone for 10+years.Also, I turned on this feature by accident and can't find how to turn it off again.I appreciate all your input, cheers!"

I tried Gemini.. impressive, but knowing I'm not paying 20 euro a month or whatever it is a year down the line, I turned that off and reverted to Google assistant. And here's where it really shines over the other generational incremental improvements. The Google assistant really works. Anywhere in the same room. With relatively complex queries like \"hey Google, how do I say 'what time is the next ferry' in German\"....  And it's pretty faultless.. fully understanding my dribbling slurry commands. Excellent job. Which leads me to the next major plus: the speakers are fantastic. Absolutely piddle all over the speakers in my larger tablet and, night and day to the p7p.Added a lovely bellroy terracotta leather case, applied an lk tempered glass protector and I feel I'm now master of a true flagship.I wanted to use pixel launcher, but some clown at Google still thinks it's a good idea we can't remove the home screen clock\/widget.

            "self_text": "I picked up a obsidian 9 pro (256 GB) from my carrier that was $800 off as part of my phone plan (only had to pay \\~300 out of pocket). I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."

This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."

When charging, the phone has a very strong and strange \"electrical\" friction all over the metal frame, it's clearly as there's some discharge on the metal frame (no, it's not static electricity because it happens only when I charge it).2. Notifications are delayed even if I turned off \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Adaptive Connectivity\": sometimes I get them only when I wake the phone (they start to pop up the moment I wake it), sometimes they simply don't show unless I open the app for which the notifications are delayed (e.g: I open Whatsapp, I get the messages notifications), I even missed a Whatsapp call without any notification. This is a pretty serious issue (which I never had with any other phone in the past), if my Pixel 8a can't be reliable on basic phone features, I don't know if I want to keep it.3. After the Android 15 update (two days ago), Google Play Services is running in background 100% of the time (i.e.: from midnight to 8am you'll see 8 hours background usage for Google Play Services in the battery details), draining the battery. I see at least 10% drain over 6-7 hours during the night.4. A Samsung fast charger that charges rapidly all other phones instead charges my Pixel 8a very slowly (3 hour for 20-30%), I even tried another cable but inexplicably the issue persists.5. Pixel support is quite absent, I contacted them for issue #1 and then updated them with issue #4 (since it's charging related), they asked for pictures of the frame in the support chat, then for other pictures of the frame in the support email, but then nothing, now it's 5 days that I don't have any answer. Now I'll send details about issue #3, but I don't feel good about this situation.Any idea on what to do or any help would be really appreciated, factory reset is not an option (eSIM would be lost, I would lose access to banking apps which need one device always active, and so on). EDIT: \u00a0I've updated both Google Play (open the app => Settings => About => Update Play Store) and Google Play Services (manually going to its Google Play page).  I think the phone is defective due to #1, but #2 and #3 are not HW issues, so I'm thinking about buying another phone and return this (support not answering of course is a factor in this decision, 7 days of the 14 days for returning it are already gone). It's a pity because I really wanted a Pixel, I always had \"near stock Android\" phones (Nexus S, Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G8, Moto G100) and I thought this would be a sure choice and a solid improvement, but I've read so many threads here of people complaining about #2 and #3 that I'm not sure I want to keep trying with this phone.Thanks in advance! \ud83e\udd17"

            "post_title": "A Data Point for Battery Health Over 2 Years, the 80% Charge Limit, \"Battery Bypass\"",
            "self_text": "**tl;dr at the bottom.**I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of discussion on the new 80% charge limit released in the December Pixel Feature Drop and wanted to share some of my experience with a 75% charge limit set near-permanently on my Pixel 7 Pro via root. # My Experience Over the Last 2+ YearsI bought a Pixel 7 Pro on release (Oct. 2022) and immediately rooted it. Among other things, I knew that I wanted to set a charge limit on it right away. At the time, a lot of the tools that worked for other phones (like AccA) didn\u2019t work for the Pixel 7 Pro (I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like now), so I hacked together a two-line Magisk module to take care of it for me. All it did was limit the charge to 75% and start charging again below 67%.\u00a0I\u2019ve now daily driven this phone for the last two years, and while I\u2019ve occasionally charged the phone to full (to calibrate the battery) or set the limit higher (e.g., 90% when I\u2019m traveling), with only a few exceptions I\u2019ve maintained the 75% charge limit. Now, AccuBattery isn\u2019t necessarily perfectly accurate (but if anyone knows anything better, please do let me know!), but I\u2019ve had AccuBattery Pro installed on my phone since day 1, and here are the stats: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BDBPeEG](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BDBPeEG)Even when my phone was new, AccuBattery only ever reported 99% health (expected, due to small individual manufacturing differences in the batteries). Today, more than two years later, I\u2019m sitting at 98%. From the perspective of someone who doesn\u2019t intend to replace their phone very often, I\u2019d say that bodes extremely well for longevity.\u00a0# \"Battery Bypass\" With the 80% Charge LimitRegarding \u201cbattery bypass\u201d - if you\u2019re familiar with other charge controllers, you\u2019ll likely have seen this feature aptly referred to as \u201cbattery idle mode.\u201d The Pixel 7 Pro (and I would imagine all other Pixels that got the Feature Drop) has always supported running only off of the charger when the battery is considered \u201cfull\u201d (or whatever charge limit is set). This can be observed easily in AccuBattery - when charged to the limit, the \u201cBattery current\u201d bar will show 0 mA, indicating the battery is now idle. This is beneficial for long road trips to prevent the battery from getting too hot, but this would previously kick in even if a charge limit isn\u2019t set (battery idle mode would just start at 100%).\u00a0No need to stress - it's absolutely not letting it drain a little then charging it a little and using small charge cycles. If it were, it'd be clearly visible in AccuBattery and other battery monitoring tools. However, I've noticed that if you go over 80% (e.g., if you charge while your phone is turned off and it doesn't get limited), it will drain until 80%, even if plugged in (which is expected).# Can someone explain why some people are so against it?I also want to take a second to talk about some of the strange (?) discussion I\u2019ve seen arguing against this \\*optional\\* feature. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s lacking nuance, or just bad faith for some reason.\u00a0* \u201cWhy would I lose 20% now to save 10% in 5 years?\u201d It\u2019s an \\*option\\* - you can turn it off when you need the 100%, and turn it on when 80% is enough to get through your day or chargers are within reach. So you lose literally nothing, but gain battery health.\u00a0* \u201cI don\u2019t need to care about my battery health since I get a new phone every one or two years.\u201d This one is just strange - clearly, this option wasn\u2019t built for your use case. You wouldn\u2019t go to a thread discussing a new Pixel feature for blind people and proclaim \u201cwell I don\u2019t need this because I\u2019m not blind\u2026\u201d (...hopefully?) I\u2019d argue even Adaptive Charging is unnecessary for those who replace their phones frequently enough that battery health isn't a concern. The battery charge limit is for the rest of us who don\u2019t replace every year and want to take care of our several hundred dollar devices for a long time.# All in AllI\u2019m very excited for this feature because I can now finally toggle it easily (unlike a Magisk module, which requires a phone reboot every time to turn it on\/off) and it reduces my reliance on root. With the recent news about the Pixel 7 Pro getting another two years of Android updates, the future of this phone is looking pretty damn good!**tl;dr: 1-2% battery degradation over 2+ years with a 75% charge limit set nearly all of the time on a Pixel 7 Pro.**\u00a0"

Besides that over the last 2 months of my lurking, I've seen countless complaints about overheating... but at the same time I've also seen loads of people say they're very happy with their phones, not listing overheating as that big of an issue.  I don't exactly live in a hot climate, but I don't live in the Arctic Circle either.

I understand the price level is still a massive barrier (I got mine at a really good price) but even with that caveat anyone with half a brain would be raving about this new form factor but the reluctance to say anything super positive about it is baffling.I dunno, maybe when Apple brings out their foldable phone it will be \"revolutionary\" (although I think they might be reluctant to do this as it would eat massively into their iPad market).Anyway that's about it, just find the whole situation weird.EDIT: Sorry guys I think I have to clarify my post as people seem to be missing the point. I understand there are optimisation \/ durability issues etc with current foldables (although having used the foldable 9 for the last month I'm very comfortable in saying it's an awesome phone) but my point is that the reaction to the idea \/ concept of a foldable phone has been, IMO, surprisingly muted.

            "self_text": "Interestingly, Google has gone the hardware route in improving camera performance by increasing sensor size to reduce noise in the shadows with Pixel 7 and 8.  Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.  Anyway.  This tech also seems to be the foundation of Pixel 8 software features like Magic Erasure and Motion Blur, so that's pretty cool too.  "

I then check the page again and go to a different location and luckily it's an open store this time. I walk in and they have no idea about this Program but try and help me anyways. Unfortunately, they have no idea what type of battery my Pixel 4a uses and tell me to go back to Google and ask them. I get Google Support to call me and they of course don't tell me the Battery part number but give me the steps of the Appeasement instead and keep saying something about receiving an email in the next 21 days. I tell them I've already been through the registration page and received the update and already received all the emails referencing and telling me what to do for my battery replacement but unfortunately the agent on the phone just keeps repeating the talking tree they are given. Has anyone actually been successful at getting Google to replace the Battery?"

Man I hate Google so much!!!",
            "self_text": "So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go \"Is that child porn?\" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here \"A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious.\"\u00a0[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said \"Why should other people have more privacy than I do?\" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer \"only store passwords locally on device\" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While\u00a0not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable \"Advanced Data Protection\" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself;\u00a0this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account.\u00a0So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!!

A quick look at battery settings claimed the last full charge had been 21 days ago. The battery itself was replaced about 1-2 years ago, so relatively new compared to the phone. Cleaning the charging port of dust did not help. The cable is working fine; plugged it into a different phone and it started charging. Plugged it into a older (probably 1-3A) adapter, with the same results.So my guess is the charging assembly has randomly gone kaput. What other possibilities I should be thinking of and is there anything I can try? Right now the battery has run down to 1% between all my futzing so it will shut off after a pretty short time."

From 13.12 - 18.12 the cell phone was in Frankfurt according to tracking, but did not move.So I contacted Google and UPS, and finally Google requested an investigation from UPS on 20.12.2024.**So far so good, now the fun part begins:**I contact Google support almost daily, either by email or livechat, but I just can't get an statement on how much longer it will take.As you might imagine, I keep getting referred to the famous \u2018higher-level support\u2019.Even though it's certainly not my job, I also contact UPS almost daily, but they also tell me that they will pass it on and I should wait.Even clear questions to Google support as to why they don't send me a replacement device in advance are simply not answered.I have already asked for a supervisor, who has also contacted me by email, but as you can imagine, I only get generic answers to my problem.I've been a Google user since the Nexus 4, and luckily I've never had to use support. What I'm currently experiencing is hard to believe. I have never experienced such poor support.It is absolutely clear that my phone will never turn up again, and I have already made it clear to support that it is not legal under German law for an investigation between the sender and the transport company to be carried out on the back of the customer. But as you can imagine, nobody is interested in this either.Do you have any ideas on how I can proceed in this case?Thank you in advance for your ideas.Best regards, Kristian\\----Update 21.01.202----After the Google support account contacted me via Reddit, everything went pretty quickly. My case was apparently escalated to another location, and yesterday I received information that a replacement device was on its way to me.     To make this clear: I am very grateful that I was helped at this point, but I am still of the opinion that it cannot be the case that you cannot get anywhere directly with Google support and apparently only get help when you take the issue to social media    By the way, UPS contacted me again today and said that the investigation is still ongoing."

And the replacement works!  Put in the SIM card and got the normal Cricket new phone setup messages instead of the \"not compatible\" messages.

Fastboot >> power off, then turn on again3. Fastboot >> recovery mode >> ADB to sideload november update4. Fastboot >> recovery mode >> wipe >> ADB sideload november updateNow, I'm stuck with the phone in a boot loop and UNABLE to enter recovery mode. Every time I try, it continues to go through the boot loop or occasionally gets stuck forever (for hours) on the white screen with a google logo.I have since switched from Verizon to a smaller carrier, and have the phone paid off. However, this means that I cannot use the pixel flash utility as it requires the OEM-Unlock toggle to be toggled off in the operating system, but I can't even get there as I can't get back to the recovery screen.  **Now, for what some of you are here for - What is the nature of the weird google support interactions?**When the boot loop issue came up, I got in a chat with google support. My support agent was not able to tell me the correct method to get into recovery mode. Even after I found out how to get to the recovery mode on my own via google's own support page, the agent did not acknowledge that they were not giving me the correct guidance on how to get into recovery mode. They then asked me to take a screenshot many times after I told them that my phone was stuck in a boot loop and so I could not get a screen shot.(For GP6P, you need to go into recovery mode from fastboot, then you need to press the power button and volume up button in sequence. Until you get the hang of it, you just need to keep at it until you get the timing right. IF you don't you're met with a dead android figure on the screen and a headache)After the agent finally escalated my support case, I've received several emails asking for a screen shot of what the going on with the phone. I finally borrowed a used phone and used it to take a video of the boot loop process. After sending that along, the google support person sent me a link via email (through the same google support email and thread we had since been communicating in) asking to check the screen shot to confirm if this was what I was seeing.The link sent me to a google SSO log-in page. I assume that the link they sent is to a photo or video that is in their personal or enterprise system and only certain people can log in to see it. I did not try to log in as it seemed phishy...Is this normal? Am I dealing with a VERY elaborate phishing attempt? Do I just suck-it-up and hope that my case gets escalated to someone that can help me better?Thanks in advance to anyone that took the time to read my post! I appreciate it!"

            "post_title": "I'm baffled at how bad my first user experience was with my p8",
            "self_text": "Coming from 21 ultra got the new phone about a week agoWhen I first grabbed it my first impressions of the phone were pretty good, it feels responsive, it has a pretty good screen not amazing (il get back to this) but I have no complaints, it feels good to hold\/the build quality is nice, the screen is a bit small but I can get used to that. So I went thru the motions of setting it up while disabling the data collection permissions( the fact that the buttons\\toggle switches are gray when enabled is vile)  I logged into my Google accounts imported my stuff from my old phone I did the necessary updates and... Here's where my gripes started.So I looked at my brand new homescreen and naturally I wanted to personalize it and immediately the first thing I wanted to do was to get rid of the Google search bar at the bottom of the screen (I prefer crome, i like my tabs and the phone is so small I don't want it taking any realestate) so like the s21 ultra ,the s9, the moto g, the other moto, the other other moto, the Lg z? And the Nokia of old. I took my finger and I long pressed the search bar... Nothing. I did it again, nothing happened. So I went into my settings and I used every word I could think of to find out how to remove that bar, 15ish minutes later I gave up and went to go attack something else. My frustrations were rising, after all, this was so simple to do for the past 10 years why would it be different on \"THE\" android device. Not only that but every time I opened up a Google or a phone related app I got a forced tutorial telling me thing like \"this is a search bar use it to explore content\" or \"here is a basic setting that every other phone has here's how to use it\" now this wouldn't be a issue normally, If I hadn't had these messages pop up every time I was opening a app even the ones I had opened before. Google Play told me what a search bar is 8 times. Back to the homepage, So I turned my attention to the assistant\/feed thing at the top of my screen, I like it simple, my home page has been the same for the past 8 years I have a clock with the date at top dead center usually taking up 2 to 3 rows followed by my most used apps underneath. So I go and fiddle with the \"at a glance\" feature and that's also when I discovered that you can just fully disable the ai assistant. HUZZAH! And you can block it from accessing anything. Double HUZZAH! And there's no annoying ass dedicated button on the phone that links directly to said ai even if you disable it at every possible place! Triple HUZZAH! (Looking at you Bixby) But my joy was short lived because, for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to make it a clock, how to modify it or how to remove it.  So after a hour of fiddleling with it I finally gave up and googled it. I had to google how to access a basic android functionnality that had taken me 5 min with every other phone since 2010. And what I discovered almost made create a nice phone shaped hole in my wall. So it turns out you can't remove the at a glance or the search bar normally, turns out you need something called a launcher.So it turns out that you can select your own launcher and truly make your phone your own which is pretty cool except that the base launcher is missing allot of the customization options I would expect from one of the main smartphone companies. Anyway I browsed Reddit and one of the main launchers people where recommending was nova, cool. So I downloaded it, installed it opened it and I immediately felt my blood pressure spike by 3000%. I saw to my beguilement, to my vexation... a paywall. keep in mind all I wanted to do is clean up my home screen a feature I've always had even on the cheapests of phones. So I immediately deleted the launcher and tried another one on the Playstore, Same story, and another one again a pay wall.  So at this point I'm fuming I'm ~2 hours into having my new phone and I can't even remove a fucking widget from my home screen without paying 30$ but finally I decided to download lawnchair wich does exactly what I want (yay) (except that its a 3rd party app\/program\/launcher that as far as I can tell launches at start up and can potentially see\/detect everything you do (I could be wrong but the nerd in me ain't feeling this shit but I'll begrudgingly accept it for now)It also randomly crashed twice ) Now at this point all would seem good I've unlocked the basic functionalities that I'm used to and all seems to be in place I've shut up the ai, disabled every data collection service I could find and customized everything I could but something felt off... The pixel density is lower than my old s21 ultra that I knew but it was something else. This is a OLED screen it clearly is it look great while watching videos so why in the name of god is everything a slight washed out gray. Turns out there are basically no true black backgrounds in any of the base phone\/Google apps\/programs all of the current Samsung phones have it and force Google apps into true dark mode so why doesn't google do it? Who knows? and the cherry on top is that the only way to get arond it to get that fancy new display actually utilised as a OLED for most things is to DOWNLOAD A ROOTKIT ...FML. i did it. makes everything look objectively better, true black, you know, the entire point of having a OLED display. But god dam is this dumb. There is no way for me to emphasise at what point it is morronic and unsafe to have to do give a 3rd party application off of the Play store root access just to have access to a basic functionality of your display.Anyway apart from those 3 minor\/major inconveniences I don't really have a problem with the phone . Keep in I had to do all that just to be able to remove 2 basic widgets that are for some reason immovable and make my screen slightly darker (this could literally be implemented tomorrow when I enabled true dark mode in YouTube with my s21ultra I'm pretty sure there was a toggle built into YouTube asking if I wanted the gray or the black meaning the option is already the they just won't give it to us) "

            "self_text": "At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

Since then, Google has iteratively locked Android down more and more, by taking away existing features or by promoting the manager that made a feature and letting it get killed the next cycle. Apple (whether of their own volition or under pressure) has gone the other way, slowly but surely opening up iOS to more user customization, alternative app stores, allowing RCS, third-party keyboards, and adding genuinely useful things like lock screen widgets, . Developers are overwhelmingly more focused on their iOS apps and bring features there first with Android apps always getting features later. Things that were unique to Android like automations are now present (in a lesser degree) in iOS as shortcuts. Developers are all more willing to integrate Apple's new APIs in integration things like Live Activities and Dynamic Island support, while half the Android apps I use still aren't sure whether the navigation bar needs a transparent background or not. The only places where I feel Android still fares better is with notification management, and the community's ability to circumvent corporate greed (things like ReVanced, Instander, 3rd party Reddit apps). What areas do you feel Android does better than iOS now?Edit: it's a bit surprising that a lot of people's notion of what iOS is like today resembles what it used to be like 5 years ago. Is this the \"Androids have bad cameras\" for this subreddit?"

After 8 years, 9 months and 5 days, I am no longer employed by Nova and\/or Branch Metrics. >Yesterday, August 7th, Branch laid off 100+ employees in a massive layoff across the entire company. Myself, along with Rob, and many others with great talent were affected. >As many of you know, and for those that don't know, I worked for Nova for 8 1\/2+ years starting back in November 2015. It was one heck of a great, enjoyable ride that I wouldn't trade for the world. >I'm not sure what the future holds for me personally, but I see this as an opportunity to move on to something bigger and better. Though with the great experience I had at Nova, better seems tough to accomplish. >Again, this has been an amazing journey over the past nearly 9 years and I am certainly sad for it to end. I'm going to miss so many things about this job. My boss, the users, the customers, the flexibility and of course the amazingly talented people I got to work with along the way!>I want to give a huge thank you to Kevin Barry himself who gave me this opportunity nearly 9 years ago. I never imagined how this job would change the lives of both myself and my wife. I've done so many things because of Nova that I never thought I'd get the chance to do. >I also want to say thank you to folks such as Alex Austin, Phil Wall, Steve Blackwell and numerous others at Branch. Alex was the one who brought me over to Branch with the acquisition of Nova 2 1\/2 years ago and gave me yet another opportunity of a lifetime and I couldn't be more thankful. >To all of you, the Nova users and community, thank you for being so awesome and providing great laughs, great times and so much more over the years. Especially to those of you who have ever taken the time to speak in the Nova Discord server. You've brought so much joy to my life over the years and those memories will last a lifetime.>As for the future of this Discord server, I will have an update in the coming days with details as to what happens next. I hope you'll all stick around for what's next here.>If anyone knows of any positions that are available in the customer support\/customer specialist side of things, please let me know as I would like to get something similar to what I've been doing for the past 8 1\/2 years. I would also like it to be 100% remote if at all possible. >While today is a sad day, the future is bright and here's to whatever the future has in store, which I'm sure will be more awesome things.[Branch acquired Nova Launcher and Sesame Shortcuts](https:\/\/novalauncher.com\/branch) about two years ago.  Edit: More context from Rob & Kevin:  Rob: >To be clear, Nova development is not stopping. Kevin is remaining at Branch as Nova's only full time developer. Development will undoubtedly slow with less people working on the app but the current plan is for updates to continue in some form.>There is no longer anybody working on customer support, PR, etc   Kevin:  >To address some of the confusion. I'm the original creator of Nova and still employed at Branch to be developing Nova more or less how I always have. However I have less resources. This is hugely disappointing and I'm going to miss working with so many talented people including Cliff and Rob and many others that don't have a presence on this discord.>I unfortunately still don't know too much.

            "self_text": "*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

            "self_text": "At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Thoughts:Negatives:1) Nova Launcher doesn't work smoothly with gesture controls, there's a noticeable lag when I swipe to home. I thought it won't be a big deal, but couldn't stand it after a few days. 2) I miss the One Hand Application app for Samsung, that gave me a bunch of side of the screen gesture actions. I tried a few apps off the Google play store but I couldn't find one as reliable. 3) I miss the S pen, good for precise actions, remote camera triggers, and the occasional live sketch. 4a) I found the colors on the Samsung generally more accurate, with the Oneplus giving most photos a warmer tint than irl. Oneplus sometimes seem to have sharper images though, but that might be due to processing. Night photos and videos seem better on the Samsung. 4b) I also miss the 10x camera, which is great for travel and animal photography. 4c) No motion photos on the default oneplus camera app. I like the little snippets of video attached to each photo.5) One UI just feels more polished as an OS, more finalized and less improvised. 6) Samsung Pay turns NFC on and off automatically which seems more secure to me.  Positives1) The screen does feel slightly more comfortable on the OnePlus, so I might switch back to it if my eye strain comes back. I can see the flicker in the Samsung if I wave my fingers across the screen when it's dim.2) I can't seem to get true blacks in dark mode in a few apps on the Samsung, like Instapaper, while the Oneplus has it. 3) Screen off gestures are pretty convenient on the oneplus, especially the torch.4) The oneplus is lighter and less bulky. 5) The haptics are stronger and feel more satisfying on the oneplus. 6) Battery life seems longer and charging is faster. Anyone have thoughts that might make me change my mind again? "

            "self_text": "Alright, hear me out on this one... the ROG Phone 9 is arguably one of the top high-performance smartphones out right now. The biggest drawback: probably the lack of an even minimally-acceptable camera system.So what happens when you take the ROG Phone's top-of-the-line performance, long battery life, one of the only 3.5mm jacks in a flagship smartphone, and a dedicated gaming mode \u2014 and you give it a camera setup that's actually usable?The Asus Zenfone 12 Ultra: one of the most-hated (or maybe most-ignored) flagships out right now.I get it. Asus customer service sucks, it's as expensive as a Samsung, the camera still lags behind other flagships, you expect 7 years of feature updates for a phone that sells a tiny fraction of what other brands do, you still want a mini phone even though they haven't been selling, you could buy a phone from a Chinese company for $500... and so on.But for the right person (definitely not everyone), I think it's still worth a look. If you're willing to accept that at this point, Android OS \"updates\" are basically unsubstantive except for a couple new gimmicky AI features tacked on top each year, then you'll be glad to hear that this phone offers:- 5 years of software support (but only 2 official version updates)- Snapdragon 8 Elite- 5500 mah battery w\/ 65W wired charging - 3.5mm headphone jack in 2025- 50MP main camera + 32MP telephoto + 13MP ultra wide- A suite of AI features that can be run on-device instead of in the cloud- Up to 144hz refresh rate- One of the cleanest, \"stock\" feeling Android skins (with just enough random features to make it feel unique)- Incredible battery usage control (did I mention that 3.5mm jack? You can keep your Bluetooth off, and even charge while you plug in your headphones)As a current Zenfone 10 owner I've honestly loved my phone. Do other phones have better cameras? Sure, but they can't make it through two days on a single charge. The whole one-handed phone experience has been incredibly convenient, but I can't say I'd be mad if I had to watch videos on a reasonably larger screen. I think part of me is a little frustrated that for how damn fast this phone is, it would be stupid to game on such a tiny screen.No longer sold in the US, but I might try and ship one in once I'm ready to upgrade."

The S24 is currently on A14, OneUI 6.1, with A15 and OneUI 7 coming sometime. I think the OneUI 7 didn't hit a homerun in the UI revamp. Samsung sends out monthly updates. I'm glad they are bringing back the vertical app drawer. I hope they let you customize the rest of the icon shapes\/sizes with the new updates. OnePlus 12 is on A15 with OOS. It just looks nice. The animations are good, the icon layout and the ability to customize deeper into the UI than Samsung allows are great. I know they don't have the best track record for monthly updates. S24+ is 256\/12gb, carrier branded, OP12 is 512\/16gb, unlocked US version.S24+ has carrier MMwave capability, OP12 does not. Both do C band 5gUW. Same chip, same modem.   S24+ Battery life is eh, at best. Plus the sucker gets hot when Super Fast Charging 2.0.OP12 gets warm during 100W charging, but the battery life is good enough to not need it that often. If you have both and use both, which do you use for what and why?I don't think the thread is against SUB rules, but if it is please let me know!"

So I packed the two trackers in different boxes when the movers were here to see if I could track the moving truck as it moved across the country.The movers finished loading everything early afternoon on Wednesday July 24th and so far they were last seen at 12:41pm on July 24h... The last time I was personally standing next to the truck my phone.  Four nights later there has not been a single update and our belongings are expected to be unloaded at our new home tomorrow morning.  I don't expect them to be located again until I once again stand newer the truck.The 'Find My Device Network' seems to be missing the 'network' part.  It's just my phone, all alone tracking these.  I was considering getting one of the Chipolo trackers that uses a CR2032 battery for our cat, since it'll be easier for her to escape outdoors.  But what use is a tracker that can basically tell you one of two things: The tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone' and 'The tracker is NOT within Bluetooth range of your phone.'These are seemingly useless and I can't believe I spent over a year waiting for these."

            "post_title": "OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3",
            "self_text": "*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn't published this press release anywhere, so I'm pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  ---  *Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google***New York, NY, February 18, 2025** \u2013 Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD\/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

            "self_text": "So I used to daily an S20 Ultra (G988U) I bought last year and was very very dissapointed. Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"

            "post_title": "As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)",
            "self_text": "I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"

OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you\u2019re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I\u2019ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it\u2019s easy to switch between the two.2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google\u2019s Circle to Search feature](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgOP6XMAAQHEb?format=jpg&name=large) to OnePlus phones, finally.4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in\/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass\/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It\u2019ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it\u2019ll basically let you ask questions like \u201chow much is my next phone bill?\u201d and then it\u2019ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing\u2026but honestly it seems like it\u2019s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently? In any case, your OnePlus phone now has Android\u2019s Theft Protection feature, so go turn \u2018em on."

            "self_text": "*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

            "self_text": "I was on Android 13. Upgraded to 14 and I could not help but think \"is this all?\". Upgraded to Android 15, and the update felt equally underwhelming. I went looking for some new features introduced in both updates and here are the ones that stood out to me.**Android 14** * App pairs - Nice, but I doubt I'll use it much.* Pin auto-confirm - Nice feature, but considering modern unlocking methods, it's something I'll use rarely. * Lock screen customisation - A nice change, but I don't really care much about custom lockscreen clock fonts. I like being able to set shortcut icons on the lockscreen though. **Android 15** * Private space - This is a good feature. Don't think I'll be using it much, but it's good to have. * Volume and ringer adjustment look - The old one was fine too. * Partial screen recordings - Good feature to have, but it's not something I'll be using every day. * Back animation - I like this change, but I wish they had removed the back arrow for places where they use predictive back animations, it is unnecessary in those scenarios. * BT Audio sharing - A decent feature, but you need to have the compatible hardware that supports it.* USB-C to monitor video streaming - A nice feature to have, but I'm not sure when I'll use it. But it's good to have. Have I missed some important feature? The features I listed are good but they are nothing really ground breaking, it does not even have to be something big. For example, screen rotation button introduced in Android 9 was a relatively small feature, but it made a big difference for me, I turned off auto-rotate after its introduction. Android 14 and 15 feel like underwhelming updates. Then I started thinking what would actually make a difference for me, and I do have [my thoughts](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/100i7on\/sunday_rantrage_jan_01_2023_your_weekly_complaint\/j2ihvdt\/) about it. I am interested what features would you still like to have introduced in Android 16 and higher?One thing I am not happy about is that Android 14 and 15 broke compatibility with some of my old, but very useful apps like: SuperGenPass, Open Link With, Anything to PiP, AutoConvert, List My Apps. I wish there was a workaround for that. It seems like utility apps are not being developed much anymore and whatever is there is losing compatibility. Also, you cannot have sticky notifications since Android 14. I use some apps (a network speed monitor and a todo list app) that utilise sticky notifications, it was convenient not be able to accidentally swipe them away."

I actually preferred it over the S24 Ultra and decided to sell it. It's Display was on par with all 3 of those phones if not better. The software was actually more smooth than all the other phones which surprised me. You can purchase them brand new for around 700$ and flash the EU Room to make it run like a global rom.

As this setting isn't supposed to exist in 14, the value was reported as null through ADB.To enable cat controls:* Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options.* Connect your phone to your PC.* Run `adb devices` to connect your phone to ADB.* Run `adb shell settings put system egg_mode_s 1`* Launch `ComponentActivationActivity` in `com.android.egg`.

Many posts on reddit recommending doing rooting with different modules which I found a lil risky, and it also says after rooting android updates will stop coming, we have to seek and update manually. Maybe I'm wrong. But just yesterday I found a way to add or delete files in data folder android 14. You only need 1 app - https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.folderv.file which is a quite common app. NOTE: I'm using Samsung device - OneUI 6 - Android 14Here are the steps to add file\/folder -1. Copy\/move desired file\/folder into android into 'Android' folder1. Open FV file manager, link is above2. Give storage permission 3. Open files box which will be somewhere in lower middle on screen.(it'll open 2 split screen, close lower one where 'download' folder is open, then it'll be only left Internal storage folder open) 4. Open Android folder > Move the desired file\/folder by dragging into data\/obb folder. (Note: here manually means click and hold for a sec then drag it into data\/obb folder) 5. Open data\/obb folder, you'll find your file\/folder at bottom in data folder. Again drag it into your desired app folder, follow it again and again till you move it into destination folder. "

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"

            "self_text": "Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"

            "self_text": "I was on Android 13. Upgraded to 14 and I could not help but think \"is this all?\". Upgraded to Android 15, and the update felt equally underwhelming. I went looking for some new features introduced in both updates and here are the ones that stood out to me.**Android 14** * App pairs - Nice, but I doubt I'll use it much.* Pin auto-confirm - Nice feature, but considering modern unlocking methods, it's something I'll use rarely. * Lock screen customisation - A nice change, but I don't really care much about custom lockscreen clock fonts. I like being able to set shortcut icons on the lockscreen though. **Android 15** * Private space - This is a good feature. Don't think I'll be using it much, but it's good to have. * Volume and ringer adjustment look - The old one was fine too. * Partial screen recordings - Good feature to have, but it's not something I'll be using every day. * Back animation - I like this change, but I wish they had removed the back arrow for places where they use predictive back animations, it is unnecessary in those scenarios. * BT Audio sharing - A decent feature, but you need to have the compatible hardware that supports it.* USB-C to monitor video streaming - A nice feature to have, but I'm not sure when I'll use it. But it's good to have. Have I missed some important feature? The features I listed are good but they are nothing really ground breaking, it does not even have to be something big. For example, screen rotation button introduced in Android 9 was a relatively small feature, but it made a big difference for me, I turned off auto-rotate after its introduction. Android 14 and 15 feel like underwhelming updates. Then I started thinking what would actually make a difference for me, and I do have [my thoughts](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/100i7on\/sunday_rantrage_jan_01_2023_your_weekly_complaint\/j2ihvdt\/) about it. I am interested what features would you still like to have introduced in Android 16 and higher?One thing I am not happy about is that Android 14 and 15 broke compatibility with some of my old, but very useful apps like: SuperGenPass, Open Link With, Anything to PiP, AutoConvert, List My Apps. I wish there was a workaround for that. It seems like utility apps are not being developed much anymore and whatever is there is losing compatibility. Also, you cannot have sticky notifications since Android 14. I use some apps (a network speed monitor and a todo list app) that utilise sticky notifications, it was convenient not be able to accidentally swipe them away."

            "self_text": "Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"

I recently got a Jio Tag Go which is a Google Find My Device capable tracking device from Jio in India. It's quite cheap at \u20b9 1499 ($ 17). These devices are from our local telco & worked great. I went on a 1700km travel across South India with it. For shits & giggles, I also threw in an Apple Air Tag in the bag. Google's Find My Device network kept pace with Apple's network & both networks were within few minutes of each other in updating the location. Whether it was an airport or a hotel room, the location was updated. I would see both the tags move through the airport baggage areas almost real-time. I would leave my bag at the hotel while I was out at meetings & both Apple AirTag & Jio Tag Go would update locations almost at the same time (my hotel window overlooked a busy road if that helps).Whenever I go to a meeting, I usually leave my laptop bag in the trunk of my car. The location gets updated pretty good by a passing Android device. Bear in mind, Google's network works well in India because Android has almost 85-90% Market Share in India when compared to Apple's measly 10%. But I am happy to report that Google's network is pretty on-par with Apple's here.   Note: I have taken screenshots with location updated timings for both iPhone & Google Pixel. But I would rather not share them online to protect my & my family's privacy. Thanks for understanding."

Then 12 months later you only get $650 trade in credit.The S24U trade in credit right now is $900. And the promotional trade in credit for the newest phone is always up there. It is never as low as $650.So why are we paying full price for the phone and a monthly fee to be offered a worse trade in 12 months later? I think the appeal is to lock in the $650 trade in value outside the promotional period after paying the monthly fee for 12 months. Said value is less than $650 ($480 for the S24U). Which is stupid because everyone signing up for this would want to upgrade when the new phone releases. It's literally called the **New** Galaxy Club.The other and much worrying explanation is that trade in values are going to drop hard next year to make the $650 appealing, hence the title.The [second column](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h7WXRft.png) also has its own problem. The one where you pay $54.17 a month wait sorry $65.5 a month. Look closely at the Upgrade benefit. \"Samsung will pay the remaining installment balance.\" So you don't get a trade in credit.

Program upgrade depends on purchase method of Original Purchase Device, as follows:>(1)    If purchased with Samsung Financing (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes below), trade in Original Purchase Device after 12 months (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes) **and remaining Monthly Payments on Original Purchase Device will be paid by Samsung**>(2)   If purchased with one-time payment or Pay in 4 Installments (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes), trade in Original Purchase Device after 12 months (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes) **and get a trade-in credit worth 50% of the price of your Original Purchase Device.**No mention of trade in credit for the first option. So after paying $786 (the price I would pay after I trade in my S22U) you own the phone with no additional benefit. Which I guess makes it the better option but that requires you to go through Samsung financing which from the looks of it involves a hard credit check.I hope I'm missing something because this seems really stupid. Apple's upgrade plan looks a lot simpler."

            "post_title": "This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve",
            "self_text": "I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"

Why a PRoot container? i tried to run raw java binaries on termux without the container and they are just a pain to deal with, also, termux only officialy supports java 17 through their repos which won't even let you play on the latest minecraft version2. I will be using a program called [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) because it allows you to use your phone as a Minecraft server that can be accessed from anywhere (i like things simple). If you do not install this program, You will not be able to access your server through any device outside of the phone\u2019s LAN network unless you use another method for Port forwarding. Feel free to share alternatives for Port forwarding!Recomendations: Connect a Keyboard to your phone, Make an Account on [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) beforehand# Instructions## Step 1. Install [Termux](https:\/\/termux.dev\/en\/)## Step 2. Create a Fedora PRoot Container inside termux(Command Extracted from [AnLinux](https:\/\/github.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-App), [playstore](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=exa.lnx.a&pcampaignid=web_share))```bashpkg install wget openssl-tool proot tar -y && hash -r && wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-Resources\/master\/Scripts\/Installer\/Fedora\/fedora.sh && bash fedora.sh```And enter the Container by typing:```bash.\/start-fedora.sh```> NOTE: I choose Fedora because it is what i like the most.> ## (Optional) Step 2.1 Tweak dnf for SpeedFor this, open a terminal and type:```bashprintf 'max_parallel_downloads=10\\nfastestmirror=true' >> \/etc\/dnf\/dnf.conf```([credits](https:\/\/itsfoss.com\/things-to-do-after-installing-fedora\/#1-configure-dnf-for-faster-downloads-of-packages))## Step 3. Update Fedora & Install java and wgetRun the next command on Termux (inside linux fedora container).```bashdnf upgrade -ydnf install wget -y```The java version required for the server depends on what minecraft version it is meant for, so install the according one:| Minecraft Version | Recommended Java Version | Command || --- | --- | --- || 1.8 to 1.11 | Java 8 | dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y || 1.12 to 1.16.4 | Java 11 | dnf install java-11-openjdk -y || 1.16.5 | Java 16 |  || 1.17.1-1.19.2 | Java 17 | dnf install java-17-openjdk -y || 1.20+ | Java 21 | dnf install java-21-openjdk -y |Make sure that your java version is the correct one by running:```bashjava -version```If it is not the correct java version, install the right one and then run the next to change it:```bashalternatives --config java```## Step 4. Create a directory for the server and download the server.jar```bashmkdir minecraft-servercd ~\/minecraft-serverwget server.jar https:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar```To Download the current Server Version go to [Minecraft\u2019s Official Website](https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/en-us\/download\/server) and copy the download link, then replace the \u201chttps:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar\u201d with the download link## (Optional) Step 4.1 Setting up [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/)- **Step 4.1.1**. Create a [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) Account if you don\u2019t have one already- **Step 4.1.2**. Downlaod and run [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) inside the fedora contaner with the next commands:        ```bash    cd ~\/minecraft-server    wget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) &&.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)    ```        If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`    - **Step 4.1.3**. It\u2019s going to prompt you to \u201cClaim\u201d the device, basically paste the link in your browser and add the agent, Rename the Agent to Something like \u201cAndroidTermux\u201d- **Step 4.1.4.** Add a tunnel, select \u201cMinecraft Java (Game)\u201d on the \u201cTunnel Type\u201d dropdown menu and note the URL and IP associated with the tunnel## Step 5. Run the server for the first time and accept the EULAFor that run the next commands:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui && echo eula=true > eula.txt```## (Optional) Step 5.1 Make it an Offline Server:Run:```bashsed -i 's\/online-mode=true\/online-mode=false\/g' ~\/minecraft-server\/server.properties```## Step 6. Run the server AND [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) in parallel and attempt to enter:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```To access the server use the URL or IP of the tunnel (visible on the phone\u2019s screen or through playit.gg\u2019s website)If you have only your phone, try using [Pojav](https:\/\/pojavlauncherteam.github.io\/)# How to open the server after closing termuxEach time you want to run the server from now on, you will have to open termux, and type the next commands in the next order:```bash.\/start-fedora.shcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```# How to run a Modded ServerAfter Step 3, Instead of downloading the vanilla server.jar, go to your modpack\u2019s page, download the Server Version of the modpack and run in the way that your modpack specifies in the README### Step 1. Download the modpack on your phoneOpen the modpack\u2019s site on your browser, change the view to desktop mode and click on the server files### Step 2. Move the zip file to your container directoryFirst exit the fedora container by running:```bash#!\/bin\/bashif cat \/etc\/os-release | grep -q 'NAME=\"Fedora Linux\"'; then    echo \"This is Fedora Linux\"    echo \"Exiting to Termux\"    sleep 5    exitelse    echo \"This is not Fedora Linux\"fi```We will need Termux to access the phone\u2019s downloads, for that you\u2019ll need to type:```bashtermux-setup-storage```A popup will appear, make sure to click on \u201cAllow\u201c to provide Termux with file accessNow change the current directory to your downloads and list the contents, remember to note down the name of your file:```bashcd storage\/downloadsls```To move the archive now type:```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spacesmv \"filename.zip\" $(echo $HOME)\/fedora-fs\/root```### Step 3. Unzipping the archiveNow we just change directory to home and enter the fedora container```bashcd.\/start-fedora.sh```For unzipping we first need to install unzip:```bashdnf install unzip -y```Now rename your zip file to something simple (No spaces or symbols)```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spaces# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the New filenamemv \"filename.zip\" \"newfilename.zip\"```Afterwards we unzip our file```bash# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the file's name# Replace modded-server if you want to name the folder differentlyunzip \"newfilename.zip\" -d modded-server```And to enter the folder```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd \"modded-server\"```### Step 4. Running the serverDepending on the modpack you downloaded, there is different ways of running, for example, through a `start.sh`, or maybe by using `java -jar server.jar` so make sure to read the mod\u2019s `README.md` for that, and use the methods meant for \u201cLinux\u201dTo setup playit in the modded server run:```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd ~\/modded-serverwget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) && F.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```Dont forget what i said before:If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` on the terminal and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`Do not forget, whatever the server\u2019s run command is, append the next for playit functionality```bash& .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)# example:# .\/start.sh & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```"

            "post_title": "One of the areas that is often overlooked with modern smartphones that are equipped with bigger camera sensors is the quality of lenses, and the blur they produce",
            "self_text": "Quality of blur is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I don't ever seem to see it mentioned by reviewers on YouTube, or even websites like GSMArena. Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."

            "self_text": "So I used to daily an S20 Ultra (G988U) I bought last year and was very very dissapointed. Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"

            "post_title": "Honor Magic6 Pro: Long-term Review",
            "self_text": "Hi,I thought I'd write this review if there's other people out there like me who were looking to invest in a new smartphone and wanted to see what people thought of the Honor Magic 6 Pro. Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.For a full price handset of \u00a31100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. Here's the obvious reasons why:- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.- Excellent phone reception and sound quality\/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3\/4\/5G to boost your base voice call quality too- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour- While Samsung S24 series have \"circle to search\", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera\/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)However, here's the bits that could be better:- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications - Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer\/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get."

My phone supports 160W charging, which is insane\u2014it can go from 0 to 100% in just 20 minutes. But here\u2019s the catch: I noticed that my battery seems to discharge much faster when I use the fast charger.My ExperienceRecently, I decided to try something different. Instead of using the 160W charger, I charged my phone with a regular 30W charger, and guess what? My phone's battery lasted much longer. It didn\u2019t drain as quickly during the day, and I could actually feel the difference in how long I could use it before needing to charge again.This got me thinking: Is the fast-charging technology actually delivering \"quality\" energy to the battery? Or is it just rushing to hit that 100% mark, giving us the illusion of a full charge when, in reality, it\u2019s not as effective?I\u2019d love to hear if anyone else has experienced this. Do you think fast charging is worth the convenience? Have you tried slower chargers and noticed a difference? Let me know your thoughts!"

            "self_text": "Let me know if this needs to go elsewhere, but after doing quite a bit of searching here and across the web, there aren't many places to actually leave reviews for this device, including ASUS' own site. I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"

            "post_title": "Samsung's \"New Galaxy Club.\" seems to be a colossal rip off and very worrying for the future of its trade in program.",
            "self_text": "https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/smartphones\/new-galaxy-club\/>Get more when you upgrade.Let's look into what \"more is\"You pay full price for the S25 Ultra, then $8.33 a month, including the month you get the phone, so at checkout it's $1,308.32. Then 12 months later you only get $650 trade in credit.The S24U trade in credit right now is $900. And the promotional trade in credit for the newest phone is always up there. It is never as low as $650.So why are we paying full price for the phone and a monthly fee to be offered a worse trade in 12 months later? I think the appeal is to lock in the $650 trade in value outside the promotional period after paying the monthly fee for 12 months. Said value is less than $650 ($480 for the S24U). Which is stupid because everyone signing up for this would want to upgrade when the new phone releases. It's literally called the **New** Galaxy Club.The other and much worrying explanation is that trade in values are going to drop hard next year to make the $650 appealing, hence the title.The [second column](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h7WXRft.png) also has its own problem. The one where you pay $54.17 a month wait sorry $65.5 a month. Look closely at the Upgrade benefit. \"Samsung will pay the remaining installment balance.\" So you don't get a trade in credit. Per the [New Galaxy Club Program Terms and Conditions](https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/smartphones\/new-galaxy-club\/terms-and-conditions\/)>If you choose the New Galaxy Club program option (\u201cProgram\u201d) you will be charged $6.20 per month for Galaxy S25 or $8.33 for Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra (\u201cMonthly Payment\u201d) until you upgrade (and trade-in) your Original Purchase Device for a new phone or cancel the Program.You must make at least twelve (12) Monthly Payments to qualify for a Program upgrade. Program upgrade depends on purchase method of Original Purchase Device, as follows:>(1)    If purchased with Samsung Financing (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes below), trade in Original Purchase Device after 12 months (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes) **and remaining Monthly Payments on Original Purchase Device will be paid by Samsung**>(2)   If purchased with one-time payment or Pay in 4 Installments (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes), trade in Original Purchase Device after 12 months (terms apply, see Additional Offer Notes) **and get a trade-in credit worth 50% of the price of your Original Purchase Device.**No mention of trade in credit for the first option. So after paying $786 (the price I would pay after I trade in my S22U) you own the phone with no additional benefit. Which I guess makes it the better option but that requires you to go through Samsung financing which from the looks of it involves a hard credit check.I hope I'm missing something because this seems really stupid. Apple's upgrade plan looks a lot simpler."

When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"

Why a PRoot container? i tried to run raw java binaries on termux without the container and they are just a pain to deal with, also, termux only officialy supports java 17 through their repos which won't even let you play on the latest minecraft version2. I will be using a program called [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) because it allows you to use your phone as a Minecraft server that can be accessed from anywhere (i like things simple). If you do not install this program, You will not be able to access your server through any device outside of the phone\u2019s LAN network unless you use another method for Port forwarding. Feel free to share alternatives for Port forwarding!Recomendations: Connect a Keyboard to your phone, Make an Account on [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) beforehand# Instructions## Step 1. Install [Termux](https:\/\/termux.dev\/en\/)## Step 2. Create a Fedora PRoot Container inside termux(Command Extracted from [AnLinux](https:\/\/github.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-App), [playstore](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=exa.lnx.a&pcampaignid=web_share))```bashpkg install wget openssl-tool proot tar -y && hash -r && wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-Resources\/master\/Scripts\/Installer\/Fedora\/fedora.sh && bash fedora.sh```And enter the Container by typing:```bash.\/start-fedora.sh```> NOTE: I choose Fedora because it is what i like the most.> ## (Optional) Step 2.1 Tweak dnf for SpeedFor this, open a terminal and type:```bashprintf 'max_parallel_downloads=10\\nfastestmirror=true' >> \/etc\/dnf\/dnf.conf```([credits](https:\/\/itsfoss.com\/things-to-do-after-installing-fedora\/#1-configure-dnf-for-faster-downloads-of-packages))## Step 3. Update Fedora & Install java and wgetRun the next command on Termux (inside linux fedora container).```bashdnf upgrade -ydnf install wget -y```The java version required for the server depends on what minecraft version it is meant for, so install the according one:| Minecraft Version | Recommended Java Version | Command || --- | --- | --- || 1.8 to 1.11 | Java 8 | dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y || 1.12 to 1.16.4 | Java 11 | dnf install java-11-openjdk -y || 1.16.5 | Java 16 |  || 1.17.1-1.19.2 | Java 17 | dnf install java-17-openjdk -y || 1.20+ | Java 21 | dnf install java-21-openjdk -y |Make sure that your java version is the correct one by running:```bashjava -version```If it is not the correct java version, install the right one and then run the next to change it:```bashalternatives --config java```## Step 4. Create a directory for the server and download the server.jar```bashmkdir minecraft-servercd ~\/minecraft-serverwget server.jar https:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar```To Download the current Server Version go to [Minecraft\u2019s Official Website](https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/en-us\/download\/server) and copy the download link, then replace the \u201chttps:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar\u201d with the download link## (Optional) Step 4.1 Setting up [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/)- **Step 4.1.1**. Create a [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) Account if you don\u2019t have one already- **Step 4.1.2**. Downlaod and run [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) inside the fedora contaner with the next commands:        ```bash    cd ~\/minecraft-server    wget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) &&.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)    ```        If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`    - **Step 4.1.3**. It\u2019s going to prompt you to \u201cClaim\u201d the device, basically paste the link in your browser and add the agent, Rename the Agent to Something like \u201cAndroidTermux\u201d- **Step 4.1.4.** Add a tunnel, select \u201cMinecraft Java (Game)\u201d on the \u201cTunnel Type\u201d dropdown menu and note the URL and IP associated with the tunnel## Step 5. Run the server for the first time and accept the EULAFor that run the next commands:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui && echo eula=true > eula.txt```## (Optional) Step 5.1 Make it an Offline Server:Run:```bashsed -i 's\/online-mode=true\/online-mode=false\/g' ~\/minecraft-server\/server.properties```## Step 6. Run the server AND [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) in parallel and attempt to enter:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```To access the server use the URL or IP of the tunnel (visible on the phone\u2019s screen or through playit.gg\u2019s website)If you have only your phone, try using [Pojav](https:\/\/pojavlauncherteam.github.io\/)# How to open the server after closing termuxEach time you want to run the server from now on, you will have to open termux, and type the next commands in the next order:```bash.\/start-fedora.shcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```# How to run a Modded ServerAfter Step 3, Instead of downloading the vanilla server.jar, go to your modpack\u2019s page, download the Server Version of the modpack and run in the way that your modpack specifies in the README### Step 1. Download the modpack on your phoneOpen the modpack\u2019s site on your browser, change the view to desktop mode and click on the server files### Step 2. Move the zip file to your container directoryFirst exit the fedora container by running:```bash#!\/bin\/bashif cat \/etc\/os-release | grep -q 'NAME=\"Fedora Linux\"'; then    echo \"This is Fedora Linux\"    echo \"Exiting to Termux\"    sleep 5    exitelse    echo \"This is not Fedora Linux\"fi```We will need Termux to access the phone\u2019s downloads, for that you\u2019ll need to type:```bashtermux-setup-storage```A popup will appear, make sure to click on \u201cAllow\u201c to provide Termux with file accessNow change the current directory to your downloads and list the contents, remember to note down the name of your file:```bashcd storage\/downloadsls```To move the archive now type:```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spacesmv \"filename.zip\" $(echo $HOME)\/fedora-fs\/root```### Step 3. Unzipping the archiveNow we just change directory to home and enter the fedora container```bashcd.\/start-fedora.sh```For unzipping we first need to install unzip:```bashdnf install unzip -y```Now rename your zip file to something simple (No spaces or symbols)```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spaces# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the New filenamemv \"filename.zip\" \"newfilename.zip\"```Afterwards we unzip our file```bash# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the file's name# Replace modded-server if you want to name the folder differentlyunzip \"newfilename.zip\" -d modded-server```And to enter the folder```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd \"modded-server\"```### Step 4. Running the serverDepending on the modpack you downloaded, there is different ways of running, for example, through a `start.sh`, or maybe by using `java -jar server.jar` so make sure to read the mod\u2019s `README.md` for that, and use the methods meant for \u201cLinux\u201dTo setup playit in the modded server run:```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd ~\/modded-serverwget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) && F.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```Dont forget what i said before:If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` on the terminal and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`Do not forget, whatever the server\u2019s run command is, append the next for playit functionality```bash& .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)# example:# .\/start.sh & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```"

            "self_text": "I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https:\/\/oukitel.com\/products\/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the \"Force full GNSS measurements\" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood\/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone."

It still runs Android 13, so not totally perfect. But I'm already absolutely happy with the regular security patch. I don't care much about OS updates since it usually ruins a phone somehow. This edge 20 is reaaally smooth and the battery is still going strong. I'm impressed that it lasts me the whole day. It's got new features and everything here and there with updates. It's also protected by ThinkShield (not sure what that is though haha!).I'm sorry for those that have bad experiences with Motorola, but here is a positive one!

            "post_title": "Samsung Galaxy A54 5g review after 1 year",
            "self_text": "My first phone was a Samsung Galaxy A12. After a year, I upgraded to a OnePlus Nord 3 5g which I exchanged for a Samsung Galaxy A54 after hardly 3 months. I had purchased the 8gb-256gb (LPDDR4X and UFS 3.1, respectively) variant. It came with OneUI 5.1 out of the box and after about four months of ownership, I updated it to OneUI 6.&#x200B;Over the one year of ownership, the phone has behaved quite well. I am not a mobile gamer since I prefer to game on a computer. The phone feels good, has good weight distribution but feels a tad bit slippery so I use it with a case. The cameras are located such that my fingers do not touch the cameras unless I make a conscious effort to.&#x200B;The Exynos 1380, contrary to the general negative opinion of Exynos SoCs, has performed quite well. The 4G and 5G connectivity have been excellent and stable. It can easily handle about 30 minutes of Genshin Impact at medium settings and AFK Journey for a long time without burning through battery. I get around 40mbps and 550-590mbps on 4G and 5G respectively. This was consistent with the results from the OnePlus Nord 3 5g which had higher 4G speeds at around 55mbps while running a Dimensity 9000. Since I often use the phone as a 5G hotspot, I cannot say with much accuracy what SoT I get but I get by a day with 80-85% battery with 20% left at the end of the day. &#x200B;Call quality is also excellent except once when I had gone into the underground subway when the call was dropped but I was able to call again and continue without any trouble.&#x200B;I limit the charging of my phone to 85% and it takes about an hour for the phone to go to 85% from 20% at 25w which I am comfortable with. It only heated up very rarely when charging.&#x200B;The cameras are extremely good. I am no camera aficionado but the images look very good especially when the lighting is good. The screen is beautiful but tends to get briefly oversaturated when auto-brightness is on and you move from a shady area to a sunny or brightly lit area.&#x200B;The speakers are sufficiently loud but with less bass but I prefer using iems or wireless earphones which I use with custom EQs. Dolby Atmos is perfect at the movie preset for watching movies but I found the music preset a little underwhelming.&#x200B;OneUI 6 has been quite a load on the battery compared to OneUI 5.1 but at no point was it choppy. Although there were minor stutters and lags after unplugging the phone from charging and using the camera, it never was an issue. The phone had a habit of restarting either when it reached maximum temperature or the ram filling up but a factory reset fixed that. OneUI has always been the most complete, flexible and mature mobile UI (even more than iOS, I believe). I have certain complaints about the aesthetic and design changes with OneUI 6 but Good Lock fixed most of them and the others were not much of a problem to adjust to.&#x200B;Overall, in my opinion, Galaxy A54 is the most balanced device one can get at its price range although it would have been better if it was priced near the lower end of the bracket. Other phones target a specific aspect of the overall experience and minimally deliver on the other fronts as was with the OnePlus Nord 3. It had a blisteringly fast SoC but the phone overheated and thermal throttled before you could reach that level of performance. Although it had flagship camera hardware, the IMX890, it never could make full use of it. The phone lagged at times even with 16 gigs of LPDDR5X ram. Also, future support was ambiguous with certain sources stated 3-4 years (OS-Security) while few others stated 2-3 years (OS-Security) as against Samsung's unbeatable 4-5 (OS-Security) update policy. This is my first review of any product so please do let me know if there are any shortcomings with this review."

            "self_text": "*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

Do you have any apps you use that share a similar fate?Here are few examples of apps that I like that got ruined or abandoned. - [Skitch](https:\/\/image.winudf.com\/v2\/image\/Y29tLmV2ZXJub3RlLnNraXRjaF9zY3JlZW5zaG90c18wXzFmMTIyZTk1\/screen-0.webp?fakeurl=1&type=.webp) was an awesome photo annotation app. It had good selection of tools, but what really make it awesome was how easy it was to use, and how nice those annotations looked. There was something so [smooth about the text annotations, arrows, and pretty much all the other tools it had](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rqdN9NQf\/Skitch-2024-07-21.png). Then EverNote bought it and proceeded to kill it. There is a nice app now on Google Play called [Annotium](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=app.ngockhanh.annotium) which has more tools but it's not as easy to use, and I think the end result is not as pleasant looking as Skitch. - [SnapSeed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed) - Google has not updated it meaningfully in a good while, I feel like it's going to be added to Google's kill list any day now. There is still nothing that is simple, does not require accounts, or an Internet connection, yet feature rich like SnapSeed. It also supports image overlay, and its editing undo feature is the best I've ever seen on any app. - [Anything to PiP](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yGsIIt9izzU) - A great app that let you send anything to PiP, as the name says. You could send images, videos, YouTube videos, and have them as a floating window. For some reason it vanished from Google Play. - [Glympse](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse&pli=1) - Was a great app, and still is, but they went ahead and redesigned it, ruining the UI in the process. Even the UI graphics are low resolution, not sure how the redesign was approved. - [HERE WeGo](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.here.app.maps) - Another app that got ruined by a redesign. The new app looks great, but the problem is that it lost features from the previous app (driving mode, can't display what info you want displayed when navigating), and when you using car navigation the view is top down. You can try to manually tilt to look 3D so you can see what's ahead, but it still resets to the top down view in a few seconds, rendering the navigation part of the app useless. Transport navigation is also not updating live from you go from station to station. The worst part is that they have not done any meaningful updates in years and do not listen to any feedback. The app is just hanging in there. - [Stitch & Share](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.glitch.stitchandshare) - Used to be a great app until the dev went ahead and redesigned it, breaking it, and removing features too. Then abandoned it. - [WPS Office](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=cn.wps.moffice_eng) - This used to be the smoothest office app on Google Play, even Google Docs and Microsoft Office were not as smooth. But they ruined the context menu and other things with updates. - [List My Apps](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=de.onyxbits.listmyapps) - Super useful app, but last updated in 2016. It does not even need anything, I just hope one of the new Android versions do not make it obsolete. - [Simple Gallery Pro](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro) - The best gallery app on Android, even better than QuickPic that it supplanted. But it sold, and I feel like there will be only minor bug fixes from now on."

            "post_title": "Sony Xperia 1 V review in 2025",
            "self_text": "So I used to daily an S20 Ultra (G988U) I bought last year and was very very dissapointed. Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"

Why a PRoot container? i tried to run raw java binaries on termux without the container and they are just a pain to deal with, also, termux only officialy supports java 17 through their repos which won't even let you play on the latest minecraft version2. I will be using a program called [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) because it allows you to use your phone as a Minecraft server that can be accessed from anywhere (i like things simple). If you do not install this program, You will not be able to access your server through any device outside of the phone\u2019s LAN network unless you use another method for Port forwarding. Feel free to share alternatives for Port forwarding!Recomendations: Connect a Keyboard to your phone, Make an Account on [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) beforehand# Instructions## Step 1. Install [Termux](https:\/\/termux.dev\/en\/)## Step 2. Create a Fedora PRoot Container inside termux(Command Extracted from [AnLinux](https:\/\/github.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-App), [playstore](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=exa.lnx.a&pcampaignid=web_share))```bashpkg install wget openssl-tool proot tar -y && hash -r && wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/EXALAB\/AnLinux-Resources\/master\/Scripts\/Installer\/Fedora\/fedora.sh && bash fedora.sh```And enter the Container by typing:```bash.\/start-fedora.sh```> NOTE: I choose Fedora because it is what i like the most.> ## (Optional) Step 2.1 Tweak dnf for SpeedFor this, open a terminal and type:```bashprintf 'max_parallel_downloads=10\\nfastestmirror=true' >> \/etc\/dnf\/dnf.conf```([credits](https:\/\/itsfoss.com\/things-to-do-after-installing-fedora\/#1-configure-dnf-for-faster-downloads-of-packages))## Step 3. Update Fedora & Install java and wgetRun the next command on Termux (inside linux fedora container).```bashdnf upgrade -ydnf install wget -y```The java version required for the server depends on what minecraft version it is meant for, so install the according one:| Minecraft Version | Recommended Java Version | Command || --- | --- | --- || 1.8 to 1.11 | Java 8 | dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y || 1.12 to 1.16.4 | Java 11 | dnf install java-11-openjdk -y || 1.16.5 | Java 16 |  || 1.17.1-1.19.2 | Java 17 | dnf install java-17-openjdk -y || 1.20+ | Java 21 | dnf install java-21-openjdk -y |Make sure that your java version is the correct one by running:```bashjava -version```If it is not the correct java version, install the right one and then run the next to change it:```bashalternatives --config java```## Step 4. Create a directory for the server and download the server.jar```bashmkdir minecraft-servercd ~\/minecraft-serverwget server.jar https:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar```To Download the current Server Version go to [Minecraft\u2019s Official Website](https:\/\/www.minecraft.net\/en-us\/download\/server) and copy the download link, then replace the \u201chttps:\/\/piston-data.mojang.com\/v1\/objects\/450698d1863ab5180c25d7c804ef0fe6369dd1ba\/server.jar\u201d with the download link## (Optional) Step 4.1 Setting up [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/)- **Step 4.1.1**. Create a [Playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) Account if you don\u2019t have one already- **Step 4.1.2**. Downlaod and run [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) inside the fedora contaner with the next commands:        ```bash    cd ~\/minecraft-server    wget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) &&.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)    ```        If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`    - **Step 4.1.3**. It\u2019s going to prompt you to \u201cClaim\u201d the device, basically paste the link in your browser and add the agent, Rename the Agent to Something like \u201cAndroidTermux\u201d- **Step 4.1.4.** Add a tunnel, select \u201cMinecraft Java (Game)\u201d on the \u201cTunnel Type\u201d dropdown menu and note the URL and IP associated with the tunnel## Step 5. Run the server for the first time and accept the EULAFor that run the next commands:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui && echo eula=true > eula.txt```## (Optional) Step 5.1 Make it an Offline Server:Run:```bashsed -i 's\/online-mode=true\/online-mode=false\/g' ~\/minecraft-server\/server.properties```## Step 6. Run the server AND [playit.gg](http:\/\/playit.gg\/) in parallel and attempt to enter:```bashcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```To access the server use the URL or IP of the tunnel (visible on the phone\u2019s screen or through playit.gg\u2019s website)If you have only your phone, try using [Pojav](https:\/\/pojavlauncherteam.github.io\/)# How to open the server after closing termuxEach time you want to run the server from now on, you will have to open termux, and type the next commands in the next order:```bash.\/start-fedora.shcd ~\/minecraft-serverjava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```# How to run a Modded ServerAfter Step 3, Instead of downloading the vanilla server.jar, go to your modpack\u2019s page, download the Server Version of the modpack and run in the way that your modpack specifies in the README### Step 1. Download the modpack on your phoneOpen the modpack\u2019s site on your browser, change the view to desktop mode and click on the server files### Step 2. Move the zip file to your container directoryFirst exit the fedora container by running:```bash#!\/bin\/bashif cat \/etc\/os-release | grep -q 'NAME=\"Fedora Linux\"'; then    echo \"This is Fedora Linux\"    echo \"Exiting to Termux\"    sleep 5    exitelse    echo \"This is not Fedora Linux\"fi```We will need Termux to access the phone\u2019s downloads, for that you\u2019ll need to type:```bashtermux-setup-storage```A popup will appear, make sure to click on \u201cAllow\u201c to provide Termux with file accessNow change the current directory to your downloads and list the contents, remember to note down the name of your file:```bashcd storage\/downloadsls```To move the archive now type:```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spacesmv \"filename.zip\" $(echo $HOME)\/fedora-fs\/root```### Step 3. Unzipping the archiveNow we just change directory to home and enter the fedora container```bashcd.\/start-fedora.sh```For unzipping we first need to install unzip:```bashdnf install unzip -y```Now rename your zip file to something simple (No spaces or symbols)```bash# Replace \"filename.zip\" with your file\u2019s name and keep the quotes if it contains spaces# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the New filenamemv \"filename.zip\" \"newfilename.zip\"```Afterwards we unzip our file```bash# Replace \"newfilename.zip\" with the file's name# Replace modded-server if you want to name the folder differentlyunzip \"newfilename.zip\" -d modded-server```And to enter the folder```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd \"modded-server\"```### Step 4. Running the serverDepending on the modpack you downloaded, there is different ways of running, for example, through a `start.sh`, or maybe by using `java -jar server.jar` so make sure to read the mod\u2019s `README.md` for that, and use the methods meant for \u201cLinux\u201dTo setup playit in the modded server run:```bash# Replace modded-server if you changed the folder's namecd ~\/modded-serverwget https:\/\/github.com\/playit-cloud\/playit-agent\/releases\/download\/v0.15.13\/playit-linux-$(uname -m) && chmod +x playit-linux-$(uname -m) && F.\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```Dont forget what i said before:If playit has problems downloading it might mean that you have a x86_64 processor, in that case, type `uname -m` on the terminal and if it returns `x86_64` replace every instance of `$(uname -m)` with `amd64`Do not forget, whatever the server\u2019s run command is, append the next for playit functionality```bash& .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)# example:# .\/start.sh & .\/playit-linux-$(uname -m)```"
