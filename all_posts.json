At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.","1":"Hello Pixel Community,Today we are officially announcing the latest release of Android, Android 11, which will start rolling out to all supported Pixels over the course of the next two weeks\\*\\[1\\].

See* [*g.co\/pixel\/updates*](http:\/\/g.co\/pixel\/updates) *for details.*","2":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","3":"I just received them, maybe a mistake from Fnac... They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w7x9g1\/pixel_buds_pro_more_info\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Edit : 1 day laterHey there,I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w61knw\/comment\/ihbi45t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.# How did I get them earlier ?I just ordered them on Fnac. The \"Pre order\" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.# What's inside the boxWhen you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.# Design and comfortI thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Best regards redditors,Linkakox","4":"Not sure why, but I just wanted to put this somewhere and I found this Reddit to be the most fitting. I just want to release some steam.Me and my wife have been a Pixel (and Nexus) user from day one. Imported Pixels from other countries, just to be able to use them: USA (Pixel 1 and 5), Germany (Pixel 2XL, 3, 4, 4XL and 6) and next to this the Nexus 5, 5X and 6P (a.k.a. the skateboard or banana). Convincing my family to also go for the A-series of the Pixels and they really like them. They're not power users: 3G connectivity is fine, pictures should be good and battery life of 1 day is fine.Only, since I have replaced my Pixel 5 for an 8 (finally a smaller one!), due to a bad battery, I have been struggling. I know - especially from the Nexus-era - day-one devices aren't always great and you could need a couple of weeks for the software to get bug-free. Not really had this problem with my other Pixels, but that's mainly because I've never bought them new.I'm using the Pixel 8 for almost a month now and I feel like I have paid 675 EUR for a mid-range device with a great camera (that has to be said), but very bad battery performance and connectivity issues. My Pixel 8 will not last a day, even with 2x 45 minutes of wireless charging in my car when commuting. During wireless charging and wireless Android Auto, it gets super hot (even without a case) that my music will stutter. When picking it up to see, it feels very hot as well and it even states a warning about low performances due to the internal temperature.Since a week or so, I have disabled 5G as I have read that 5G drains the battery even faster due to a not-so-optimized modem. It is a bit better now, but only with about 10% in the late afternoon. I don't even use social media: I mainly use my phone to chat via Whatsapp (which I also do mostly via my Macbook), scroll through Reddit (is that social media?) and listen to music, but only in my car. I browse from time to time, but that is mostly it. No games, no movies, no streams.I kinda regret my so-called upgrade as it most definitely doesn't feel like an upgrade. I don't want to use any other Android brand as I believe a company that creates both the hardware and the software should provide the best experience: Apple iPad, Apple Macbook, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel. It is true for most devices in this row and it has been true for the Pixel series as well, up until now. I even kinda feel like I should have gone for the iPhone 15, while I don't even like Apple that much: I mean, it works flawlessly as a laptop to me and my iPad for drawing is also great, but I don't pick up my iPad that much for any other app. I mostly use my phone and I have been a proud Android user forever, since I switched from a Nokia with keyboard to the OnePlus One.**Edit 1:** I don't even have high refresh rate on. Just rocking 60 Hz.**Edit 2:** Small update: I have set back everything to the settings I have had before, being:- 5G enabled- Adaptive connectivity- BT enabled (and NFC\/GPS)- No smooth display (so 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz adaptive)- Dark mode- Previous default dark backgroundI have been using my phone now for about 7 hours and am at 48%. Working from home, so great WiFi connectivity. Nothing really strange here, only in my Batteryusage overview I see:- 19% Maps (SOT: 12 min. \/ Background: 9 min.)- 16% Spotify (Background: 20 min.)- 10% Android Auto (Background: 1 hour 23 min.)Rest is 5% or smaller.I did drive my car today, 2x 10 min. with Wireless Android Autio (yes, I have a USB-C cable laying in my car now, but I wanted to test out the 'original 'situation'). I did not use Maps and I did not use Spotify. Although, both are enabled (Spotify paused) with Android Auto in my overview screen.So, I think Android Auto + the fact that AA uses a lot of these resources as well, take a lot of the battery juice remaining.Next drive I will use wired AA and see what that will give. Most likely, less impact from AA, but still the same impact from Maps and Spotify even when not actively in use.**Edit 3:** I have checked my old Pixel 5 via the ADB commands on this Reddit shared: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gge9cd\/reading_battery_health_statistics_actual_capacity\/ - I find that my Pixel 5 has 665 cycles and 3408 mAh left from the original 4080 mAh. I am thinking of replacing the battery, but do you think this would help? It's a relieve just to hold that phone, so light.A reputable repair company charges 60 EUR for a battery replacement, only they say there is a high chance of breaking the screen, which is on my own risk and costs 299 EUR. I won't be doing this myself and I'm really not looking for another second hand - used - phone from 2020 with the same battery quality.**Edit 4:** I'm at 3 hours 3 min. of SOT, still with the 3 above being the biggest battery drainers. Now on 20%, 17% and 11% respectively. Didn't use AA in the meantime. Got 16% battery left.**Edit 5:** I'm at 3 hours 20 min. of SOT at 1%. Battery saving kicked in at 10%. SOT is 7% of the total of system. My wife has a Pixel 6 and has 5 hours of SOT and 30% remaning. She is using Instagram, Snapchat, etc. socials, Vinted\/Chrome (shopping) and YouTube and such all day.I also see Mobile network has a total of 19 min. but is 56% of the total battery used. This is outrageous!**Edit 6:** Another day another test. I'm ay 51% right now with 51% SOT. I have disabled 5G again as it couldn't find any network, so back on 4G again which at least is stable. Most used app is WhatsApp with 13% battery usage. Mobile network at 39% (been out a lot today). Will result in about 3 to 4 hours of SOT by the end of the day.","5":"I've been using the Pixel 8 Pro for approximately two weeks now. As a long-time iPhone user (I made the switch back during the early days of TouchWiz, for those who remember), I'd like to share my thoughts and review.    **Screen**:    Pros: The screen is overall excellent. While transitioning from the iPhone 13 Pro, I didn't notice a significant difference in quality, although the colors on the Pixel might appear slightly muted in comparison. The screen's brightness is impressive, making it highly visible outdoors. Additionally, it boasts sharp resolution, and I've kept it at the default settings.    Cons: One minor drawback is the brightness lag. Adjusting brightness takes a moment, and it can be a bit bothersome. It appears as though the ambient light sensor registers the surroundings only when the phone turns on, resulting in a brief delay in brightness adjustment.    **Performance**:    In terms of raw power, the Pixel 8 Pro is admittedly not as powerful as my iPhone 13 Pro. However, what most users truly care about is snappiness, and in this regard, the Pixel excels. Almost everything opens instantly (with 0.5x animations). The user interface is fluid, albeit somewhat less exciting compared to OneUI. However, it remains highly capable and well-designed. The only area of concern is RAM management, where Android 14's aggressive background task handling doesn't quite feel \"flagship\" to me. Nevertheless, the phone performs reliably and swiftly in meeting its intended tasks.    **AI**:    Google places a significant emphasis on AI. While it holds great potential, it's not particularly practical at the moment, primarily due to the time it takes for processing photos\u2014time that may not always be readily available when interacting with a mobile device. The photo features are impressive and remarkably capable but currently not a priority for me.    **Camera**:    Pros: The camera performance is widely acclaimed. Photos are exceptionally detailed and clear, with a remarkable night mode. The dynamic range surpasses that of my iPhone 13 Pro. Video quality is good, although iPhones maintain a slight lead, but not by a significant margin.    Cons: Lens switching is probably one of the worst i have ever seen. Apple engineers can't be that smarter to have figured the trick behind smoother transitions between lenses since the iPhone X. Like come on this is a flagship (or at least priced as one).  Front camera in application is dogwater, will talk about this in Apps segment.    **Battery**:    I've noticed mixed results in terms of battery performance:    On Wi-Fi: The battery performs admirably, offering over 8 hours of screen-on time for a variety of activities, from social media to YouTube and light gaming. It's important to consider that Wi-Fi usage typically occurs indoors, with moderate brightness and minimal GPS usage\u2014all factors contributing to extended battery life.    On 5G cellular: this shit is ass, yesterday i got aroung 2h30 of SOT from 97% to 15% using GPS for around 15min, 5G all day and browsing social media and texting (no calls) (X, instagram and WhatsApp) and listening to music. I don't know what modem Google is using inside this phone but they must change the supplier asap. it's horrendous.  **Apps**:    Here's where Android seems to lag behind iPhones, and the difference becomes quite noticeable:    Stock Apps: Many stock Google apps work seamlessly, including Settings, Gmail, Chrome, Drive, Clock, and Phone. However, some apps, like Camera and Google News, exhibit lag and unresponsiveness. Notably, the Camera app's viewfinder for photos is prone to lag, crashes, and occasionally displaying the wrong picture.    Third-Party Apps: This is a significant pain point. Waze, spotify, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Banking apps, Microsoft app suite run all MUCH better on iOS than Android, i just can't figure out why but it's facts.  When it comes to camera being used in apps, I won't even rant because people ask if im using some old emergency phone when in video calls. yes it's that bad.    Regarding the Reddit app on Android, well, let's just say it has  A LOT of room for improvement (we all know 4 interns made it...).    In contrast, most apps on iOS deliver a consistently smooth and fluid experience, creating an impression that everything was designed by Apple.    In summary, the Pixel 8 Pro is an excellent phone with minimal trade-offs. The camera is outstanding, the screen is beautiful, and the battery performs well on Wi-Fi. It's a no-brainer for Android enthusiasts, but the price point, at 1100 euros, may deter some potential buyers including me even though I pre-ordered it with the Pixel Watch 2.","6":"I don't know how this isn't being brought up in reviews, and minimally discussed on this subreddit, but the Pixel 8 Pro had connection drops and degradation that is completely unacceptable on any phone, let alone a $1100 phone on a primary carrier (Verizon, ATT, T-Mobile) in a major city.The issue is by far the worst when driving through a UWB area, and seems that the phone cannot handle jumping from tower to tower that quickly. Most of the populated areas in my city are covered by UWB at this point, as are the major highways connecting the major cities in my state.I've gone through 2 different brand new phones from Verizon, reset all network settings, turned off adaptive connectivity, and called my carrier to re-provision, and I still get 7+ instances of complete connection loss on my drive to work. I've taken download data between an Azure VM instance and a Linux VM on my phone, and I've graphed the results in the image below. Below is the iperf command I used as well.Server: `iperf3 -s`Client (P8Pro): `iperf3 -c <ip> -R -t 86400 -P 8`Graph: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/mbdwlw3Raw Data: https:\/\/pastebin.com\/uYkLJjgZUnfortunately I'm forced to return this phone and go back to my P7Pro, which while it didn't have a great modem, didn't have issues anywhere nearly this bad.I've heard Google employees frequent this subreddit now, and I beg you to please look into this issue, and you're welcome to message me for any more information I can provide you, or run diagnostics on my phone while I still have it. I love this phone, the cameras are a significant improvement, as is the overall build quality, but when my 320Kbps music is stopping with a \"network error\" during my drive to work, or on major highways, it is a complete dealbreaker.edit: I took a phone call while collecting data on my way home, and the results are depressing. This is with adaptive connectivity on (since I was testing that, and then I got a phone call). I guess I can't do anything else on my phone while I'm on a phone call. https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jlaKmJo (I removed ~5 outlier data points in the 800s that were making the graph harder to read)To everyone telling me this is anecdotal evidence and I need a baseline to compare it to, yeah I know. I don't have access to a hundred pixel 8 pros or phones in general to try my test with. I'm just one guy with one phone line, I'm not 9to5google, I'm working on it. That doesn't make what I have invalid. You'll just have to take my word that I'm in a top 25 city in the US, coverage is good, and the experience should NOT be like this. I'll post data about my p7pro when I'm able to take it.edit 2: on the same drive the p7pro is marginally better, but not much. Just from experience I haven't had any music issues or failures to send messages, so I'm not sure what's going on. Maybe this is a new android 14 issue, I don't know. I don't have any other androids I can test on so I likely won't be updating this post any further. Maybe when I get the s24 when it comes out in February, because I don't think I'll be sticking with pixel anymore. I've given them more than enough time to fix their modems, but it doesn't look like that's happeninghttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SycoDEg","7":"**Long story short:** if Google tries to fuck you, don't give up.  Their support supervisors don't try to connect the dots on data that you give them.  They don't look at attachments.  They will not talk to you on the phone, either.  There's only Level 1 support by phone, due to an awful system Google intentionally has set up.  The Google Fi doesn't have access to the Pixel resources.  In the letter, you'll see there was like 8-10 supervisor responses, and denial reasons were all over the board.There's more to the story than what you see in the letter... This is a summary of \"the final phase\" which turned out to be a cluster of back-and-forth and confusion like the other two phases. Yes, there was a Round 1 and Round 2, which I haven't even gone into.  What you see here is 'Round 3' only.**Solution:** Write a letter to their Investor Relations and tweet u\/MadeByGoogle (I have 0 followers and it still got a response).  In less than 24 hours, I got an email today saying \"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_ and I am a higher level specialist that stumbled upon your case during a routine audit.\"**Letter & More Info are Seen here:** [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA\\_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf\/pub](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf\/pub)The letter is pretty scathing, and I also called them out for something that I am fairly certain is illegal... I'm still debating on showing this to an attorney.**End Result:** I'm never buying a Google phone again.  I'm getting used to a iPhone that was given to me, and I'm likely to stay iPhone at this point.  Once I receive the device, it's getting sold. Feel free to take a few pages out of my book to get the message across... Stand your ground if you know you're right... What a colossal waste of time. **What I would do if I had to do this shit all over again:** \\#1: I wouldn't buy a Google phone at this point, and I still want to hear back from Investor Relations with an authentic answer. I hope one of their reps is reading this thread. #2: If you're out of warranty... I'd start off by doing what it says by \"asking your question to our Twitter account by tweeting '@MadeByGoogle' seen on the [1-year warranty info page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/11833075?hl=en) \\- they're better than any other basic customer support function and \"have a seemingly North American written response\" *if you know what I mean*... - I think either them or Investor Relations is what triggered the 'Customer Service Audit' where a Level 4 up specialist looked into my case, saw all the bullshit, and stepped in. In this thread, you'll hear people talking about their war stories and they mentioned resources like the BBB, the FTC, and maybe a few other channels. #3: I'd have your Date of Purchase, Date of Activation, Date of Issue, Original IEMI number (seen on the box), new IEMI number (if applicable), a picture\/copy of your uBreakIFix receipts (keep ALL of them), and a link to the 1-year warranty page all handy at a moment's notice. You also need to explain to them that changing the motherboard changes the IEMI number, because they don't seem to get that... #4: Don't let them forward you to the ***Fi*** department (I bought from the *Fi store*)... The extended 1-year warranty is in the realm of the ***Pixel*** department. #5 - For you folks who have their phones completely bricked (no charging): The fix is the same as the black screen issue. It'll need a new motherboard. I think it'll be helpful for uBreakIFix to attempt a repair under the black screen warranty. Google can diagnose this as a \"power issue\" but my battery was never replaced and it magically started working again after the motherboard was replaced. Shocker, right? I hope this helps.**EDIT #1:** The only thing I \"won\" was the battle. I'll be \"breaking even\" once I receive my phone. I \"lost\" my patience and a shitload of time, lol.**EDIT #2:** The Radio is NOT under warranty; however, supposedly the radio is integrated into the motherboard (source: uBreakIFix) and when I'm getting a new motherboard, I'm getting a new radio along with it.  The Radio issue only came after the attempted black screen fix.&#x200B;","8":"So I've been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback, and I think it's finally ready to share. This will be mostly an Apple vs. Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones. For context I went from Pixel 4a \u2192 iPhone 13 Pro \u2192 Pixel 5. I used the iPhone for ~5 months before throwing in the towel. These are obviously not all of the differences, but these are the ones that I found most \u201cimpactful\u201d on my personal experience.In order from most impactful to least. Pros:- iOS is just way faster and more reliable. Apps work so much better and faster on iOS, and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts. Memory management is better, apps seem to never ever have to relaunch, Apple does more with less (software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware). It really does seem to \u201cjust work\u201d for the most part. What it does do, it does consistently well, and things behave the way you expect them to. I haven\u2019t encountered a single bug. By far and away the biggest pro. Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole. My Pixel 4a had a number of issues. The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue (presumably) that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call, making it unable to answer, and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call. And the fingerprint sensor did not work. I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again. WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 (just silence), and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether (mobile and WiFi) multiple times\/day until I restarted it, which was also really fun to diagnose...- iMessage: Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones. Android has an equivalent product, but like many of their equivalent products, they have failed to proliferate. Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriers\/OEMs fight over standardization, which means nobody uses any of them. It\u2019s fine, but thanks to Apple, it only works on Apple devices.- Support: if you need help with an issue, unless you pay extra for AppleCare, Apple will direct you to their (mostly useless) online self-help resources, but worst-case scenario you can just walk into an Apple store (assuming you have one nearby) and they won\u2019t  turn you away. When I was looking for a new phone, it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone. When I walked into the Apple store, this is what ultimately sold me. Their reps are super nice and eager to help. Google has \u201cPreferred Care\u201d via uBreakiFix, but it\u2019s really not the same experience and there are no \u201cGoogle Stores\u201d, to my knowledge.- Video: quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip. I don\u2019t think anyone will argue against that. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos, the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesn\u2019t matter.- Ecosystem: If you DO have ALL Apple products, they work together exceptionally well. Android has some stop-gap solutions with Windows but unless you\u2019re using a Chromebook (which comes with its own compromises) there is no powerful and versatile desktop\/laptop solution. There is no good tablet or watch currently. There are options on the horizon but they\u2019ve tried this before and failed.- Connectivity: I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone. The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones.- Battery life: It\u2019s a longboi. Apple\u2019s vertical integration allows for super powerful, but also high efficiency hardware. The battery will easily last me a couple of days.- Haptic Feedback: yes it\u2019s as good as everyone says, it\u2019s almost like a whole language, and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome.- Shortcuts: I didn\u2019t really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature, but not super user-friendly. The fact that there\u2019s a sort of \u201cstore\u201d where you can simply install them is super-cool, and makes them more user-friendly. It\u2019s pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a \u201cShortcut\u201d is run. Android has some similar (but inferior) apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT, but nothing baked into the OS. Google has \u201croutines\u201d via Assistant but they\u2019re incredibly limited in what they can do.- iPhones have 5+ years of software support. The latest Pixels get \"at least\" 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that \"may include feature drops\". Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record. Hold that thought though until we get to the cons.Cons:- Spam handling: As someone who receives about 4-5 annoying spam texts\/calls per day, they just make me miserable. Firstly, and I\u2019m not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app, but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database, so it gives you a sort of quasi-caller-ID (whatever happened to caller ID anyway?). Secondly, the Pixel has the Call Screen feature, and a robust SMS spam filtering service (not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call) that works really well. There are very few things I consider \u201cinvaluable\u201d in a smartphone, but Call Screen is one of them. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined. You don\u2019t even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filtered...or buy an iPhone. iMessage has\u2026almost nothing. You can filter unknown senders\/callers, and you can bring in other 3rd party call\/message filtering apps but they don\u2019t seem to work well, and are typically a paid service. When searching through Apple support, they just direct you to talk to your carrier. Blocking callers is like a 12-step process, and there's not even a way to mark them as junk. This was \u201cthe last straw\u201d for me and why I eventually threw in the towel. I had a particularly bad day for spam. Like 10 calls\/texts in the span of a few hours. Huge #1 con for sure, but that\u2019s just me.- Notification handling and customization: On Android, notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance. Some can be silenced. The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone (if you\u2019re right-handed). Persistent notifications are non-existent, and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about. After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE, OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade. FUCKING WHY!? The swipe gestures are difficult to use. Many times I try to do a horizontal half-swipe or whatever to get to the \u201coptions\u201d menu to change notification settings, but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence. There\u2019s no way to access notification history, like you can very easily and intuitively on Android, so they\u2019re just gone forever. I\u2019ve noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications, as they have a thousand of them, but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized. The notifications on iOS don\u2019t disappear when I read them on another device (specifically Gmail) like they do on Android.- Keyboard: The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple, and something you interact with every time you pick up the device, is nothing short of astonishing. The Apple keyboard has a mind-bendingly stupid button-accessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals. GBoard on Android allows you to add a second long-press layer, add a number row, and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate. Swipe typing on iOS just\u2026doesn't seem to work very well at all. Swipe typing on Android makes one-handed typing very easy. I can even do it without looking. The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it, where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away. SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears, but other times it doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s just very confusing and inconsistent. The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud, almost ear-shattering clack. GBoard has a nice sound, like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper. It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately. 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard.- Anti-right-to-repair stance: Does it really do any good to have 5+ years of software support if they don\u2019t support the hardware? Apple is an industry-leader in preventing repairs of their own devices, and irreparable construction methods. They go to great lengths to ensure this, going so far as to serialize virtually every part, like camera modules, so they won\u2019t work, even if you swap them from one iPhone to another. They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts (sold illegally) from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits. The agreements with Apple\u2019s vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple. That means if you have a broken $5 microchip, you can\u2019t easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device, at a price that is not at all cost-effective, in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one. Although they do provide cost-effective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries.- Custom notification sounds: This is a huge one for me, because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket, and whether or not I need to read\/respond. This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what I\u2019m doing. Not possible on most iOS apps.- No universal back gesture: This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone. It\u2019s very intuitive and natural; if you want to go back, you just swipe from the edge of the screen. iOS doesn\u2019t seem to have any sort of universal \u201cback\u201d function at all. Sometimes, you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right, but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this. Also, even when it does work, swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do right-handed. The Android gesture is ambidextrous.- Desktop messaging: More \u201cwalled garden\u201d problems. In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer. On Android you can use whatever you want, it\u2019s just done through the browser. So I\u2019m forced to type on, and read from, my tiny little phone screen when I\u2019m at home, on that miserable little keyboard, instead of my 49\u201d desktop monitor and full-size physical keyboard.- Text selection: It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly, and for so long. I still don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time. Long-pressing on the screen brings up a magnified view, which is promptly hidden by the finger you\u2019re using to select when moving up. Moving this magnified view up\/down on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue. It could even be tailored to right and left-handed users, but that type of customization is atypical of Apple. You can also long-press on the space bar, but the thing moves so damn fast that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it. It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down\u2026- I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage. I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title. Instead I have to send through the contacts app, which makes it not even worth the effort. I just end up typing in my information, on that miserable little keyboard. I suspect this is another \"walled garden\" thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage, if you opt into it.- Weight: I guess some people equate a heavy phone with \u201cpremium\u201d build quality. I\u2019m of the opposite opinion. Pixel 5 is 151g vs. iPhone 13P 204g (35% lighter!). Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions. Most of this weight savings is derived from the (more durable) aluminum frame construction vs. heavier, more fragile \u201cpremium\u201d glass.- No plugins for Firefox (ad blockers, dark mode, etc). All browsers are modified versions of Safari.- Face ID: Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen, which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android. This is not an issue specifically with Apple\u2019s implementation of Face ID, but just the concept of Face ID in general. If you ask me, FaceID offers no benefits to account for this, and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor. Shortly after that, many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate (it's also just a more convenient location). Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived \u201cprogress\u201d while actually being the opposite, in my opinion.- Default SMS: If, for example, you wanted to use Signal, on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person you're messaging is not using Signal. Not possible on iOS.- Stupid fucking lightning cables: Absolutely no reason for these things to have them, but you have to spend another $100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around, in addition to USB-C cables for other devices, for absolutely no reason.- Aesthetics: Pixels and Google in general just feel very \u201cfun\u201d. Very colorful, and the Pixel UI reflects that, with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default, and \u201cMaterial You\u201d that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at. iOS, on the contrary, is fairly \u201cboring\u201d to look at, and does not change on a regular basis, much less in the last 5? years.- Slow charging (7.5W wireless, 20W wired). Bit of a nitpick here since they\u2019re more efficient and have smaller batteries, but many Android flagships are running 45-200W charging. My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless (with compatible charger, obviously). Not a huge issue either way for me, personally, as I\u2019m never far from a charger for very long.- Siri vs. Google Assistant. Google Assistant is still just so so much better.- Cost: the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was $1k. The Pixel 4a I had previously, which is, in my opinion, superior, was $350.Conclusion: The iPhone works better but the Pixel\/Android does more. I think that\u2019s the most succinct way I can put it.Apple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability, efficiency, ecosystem, and speed but just flops on the easy stuff, which is such a shame. It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000% better. I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality.","9":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.","10":"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.-----UPDATE-----Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility \u2764\ufe0f I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.-----------my response to how Google handled this--------Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line \"do no evil\" means you inherently \"do good\" cause apparently you just don't \"do\" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.----------------------- Other people ------------------------Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?Phone: Pixel 3OS: Android 11Service: Verizon","11":"Hey r\/GooglePixel,I\u2019m not super Reddit-savvy, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down.","12":"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers \/ tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending GoogleEdit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. - work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. ","13":"Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?","14":"I recently upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro and received the Gemini Advanced 12 month subscription as part of the purchase. Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like? I've used the Google ecosystem of products since day 1 and this is the most frustrated I've been with it's product.","15":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.","16":"# Update 7\/19\/24Google's team has identified a solution for people experiencing issues after factory resetting your Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a.

I do not know about updating, but as stated above I directly flashed the July patch and my 6a is working fantastic. You should be fine as long as you follow the instructions.","17":"What the hell are you doing, Google?After updating(Pixel 4), I have noticed a couple of really bad design elements, disallowing the person to choose what's best for them and then - plain worsening of the usability aspects.\"Pixel that adapts to you\" my ass. Changing accent colors based on wallpaper is marketed as advanced adapting? Taking away the user's options is the worst thing that Google could do to their customers - people who enjoy customization & advanced users who use Android devices for a reason.Here is a list of some of the \"this is dumb\" experiences I have found from my usage, and from others as well1. Lock screen clock. It's huge, it's not adjustable in any way and it looks ugly (this, of course, depends on the person, but not having the ability to change it is pretty wild) [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/V51VthNj\/a3650fda](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/V51VthNj\/a3650fda)2. Clock widget on the home screen. What is up with the ugly ass background, why can't we have an option to enjoy the wallpaper that we as users CHOOSE to set. Wasn't this what the marketing was all about? Phone adjusting to ME? This is just purely idiotic decision - why wouldn't you leave the old widgets as well, why do you have to push such shitty UI elements onto people? [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/ZBY6b6Ty](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/ZBY6b6Ty)   edit: this seems to be a bug. some people(including me) are not seeing the option to remove the background, some are.   3. Can't click on the date in the \"At a glance\" widget to open Calendar. (From comments) You can't click on the clock in the notification shade as well anymore.4. The bubbly\/stretchy animation - it's smooth, but it's not really nice seeing my whole screen bouncing around when I get to the bottom or top of something. This is especially noticeable in The App Drawer. This now feels like a kid's toy, not a device that power users could use.5. Quick toggles - I for one don't mind the new design, but the fact that you can't change how round the borders are and how much space there is in the toggles themselves - that's just wasted space. On a similar note - it's impossible to flick-swipe the toggles away now. You have to swipe up 2 times, instead of 1 flick, to return to the app you were using. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hjqj3bf4](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hjqj3bf4)6. What's a lot worse - is the fact that, for some reason, Google decided that transparent backgrounds are the enemy of state and forced solid background in both - app drawer and app switcher (and probably elsewhere). What makes it worse though, is how bad it's done. If you go in an app, press and pull the app switcher up (without releasing), the background is your wallpaper. Only after you release - the background becomes solid. (From comments) This also happens for the notification shade, even if you don't have any notifications... WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE OTHER THAN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY MY WALLPAPER? [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zK9pBGx](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zK9pBGx)7. Continuing with the idiotic design elements - The App Drawer. It doesn't look half bad, until you start scrolling. Suddenly a big gray rectangle appears at the top. For some reason the search bar is sticky, with an ugly solid background, and, of course, there's no way to change it. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zv5qW83](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zv5qW83)8. The \"styling\" of the Google Launcher. You can't change the style of little icons anymore, you can't change the style of big icons, you can't change the fonts, you can't change the accent colors to anything else than the bland 4 colors that are provided by Google. You basically can't do anything customization-wise, that you could on Android 11.[https:\/\/postimg.cc\/94ZXzfmP](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/94ZXzfmP)9. And now to the worst offender - the notifications. Grouping is different (worse), each notification in the shade takes up a lot more space - not because there's more information, but because of the rounded corners and added spacing in each notification. One message takes up half the screen, basically. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hc3g7cfM](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hc3g7cfM)10. (From comments) Everything looks monotonous.11. (From comments) At a glance widget taking up the whole width of the screen for some reason.12. (From comments) Font size feels too big. If you go into settings and change it - then it's too small. There's a noticeable \"gap\" between the settings now, where you can't get the font to be \"just right\".Don't get me wrong - the update is probably a good thing, but the \"minor\" things that Google has left in there - that look plain ugly, that worsens the experience, that ruins the look of the device completely is too much to handle.In addition - I'm usually very open minded to visual changes and different experiences, but this update, especially from UI\/UX perspective just feels cheap. It feels like I traded in my smartphone for a toy.I would like for someone at Google to read this, but they probably won't, and probably wouldn't care anyways. For the first time since owning the device I'm feeling like I will have to go with custom rom to be able to adjust MY experience with the device.Google has released first hardware upgrade for their cameras in years - that could welcome a lot of new users. The new Tensor chip sounds awesome as well. The price is very aggressively set.But every single thing of that won't matter, if the software experience feels cheap and looks like crap.Rant over, cheers.&#x200B;edit: adding some points from comments as well","18":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!","19":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","20":"So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall. Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!","21":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.","22":"Why did they change this? Google Podcasts was lean and mean and just the way I liked it. I had my subscriptions and had no need to go through 15 layers just to download and listen to a podcast. And it was easy to \"explore\" other Podcasts and come across something interesting in my explore feed (my only gripe was that I couldn't get shit like Shapiro or other right wing grifters out of my Explore feed).Now on YouTube Music, it's a bloated home screen full of extraneous shit. It defaults to the podcast video unless otherwise specified. I've downloaded the audio versions, but since i have my settings set to only \"stream\" when connected to WiFi, it seems like they only actually download a small percentage of the time. There have been multiple times where I download a podcast, see the checkmark verifying that, and then when I step outside it kicks out. I'm sure there are easy enough solutions to this, maybe, but I legitimately hate the changeover. It sucks. Simple isn't a bad thing.Edit: Appreciate all the suggestions and will take a look into them. Also glad to hear I'm not the only one baffled by this stupidity. But even with these other options - the reason I went with the Pixel is because I liked the simplicity. I liked not having to depend on various outside apps or bloat to take advantage of my phone.Edit 2: A month later, but I'm still getting responses so I figured I'd mention - I've been using Pocketcasts and so far, so good. Not quite as seamless as Google Podcasts, but much better than YT Music.","23":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","24":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market.

Used Pixels the last 5-6 years, going from a Pixel 2 to 3a to most recently a 5. IMO the 5 was (is?) literally a perfect phone, the fingerprint reader is 100% accurate (with the tape hack), it STILL takes amazing pictures, amazing battery performance even after 3 years, etc etc. If it wasn't losing security updates I would continue to use it. However, recently I decided to try to embrace iOS considering a lot of the other tech in my house is Apple. I have multiple sets of AirPods, M1 Mac, as well as an Apple TV. I also wanted to feel what iMessage and Facetime were like after being denied them for so long. I got an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB on launch day and have been using it the last ~month. My impressions:### The Good* Of course, beautiful hardware. Definitely the best industrial design in the world for consumer electronics. * Performance hiccups are virtually nonexistent. * When you do things the Apple Way, or go 100% 1st party, it really does work well. Some examples would be things like the 1st party Mail app, Airpods switching seamlessly between MacBook to iPhone to Apple TV. Spatial Audio. ### The Bad* When you *don't* go 100% first party, or do things the Apple Way, the result is painful. Eg, not being able to set Google Maps to be the default mapping application is pretty annoying. * iMessage is cool but I've noticed that both Google and Apple appear to be converging onto some sort of frankenstein protocol where \"reacts\" from either system show up correctly on the other. I had a bit of an \"oh shit\" moment when I first texted someone on Android from my iPhone and they reacted to a message with a thumbs up and it showed up...fine. Same as how I could see iPhone reacts on Pixel. Okay. So really the benefit is just...read receipts, typing notifs, and high quality image sharing? * Facetime is awesome - but I can get an iPad for that seeing as the main use would be showing off my kid to his grandparents. * The camera is good, but...only perhaps marginally so compared to my 3 year old Pixel 5? This I think was the most surprising. I expected to be \"wowed\" by the camera considering the attention Apple gives it - and it's really just okay. I think I did not appreciate how far ahead Google is with computational photography. I\u2019m heard iPhone dominates when it comes to video and I don\u2019t doubt that. However I rarely shoot videos, or if I do, they\u2019re just for fun. * Photos management is a mess on iOS. This one was a big surprise to me. I thought as a \"creator's platform\" it would offer a lot more flexibility in terms of organization and management, not the case. iCloud is a very poor, unintuitive system. Pretty clearly designed for people who will get lost if any kind of folder system is introduced. ### The Ugly* I feel like I'm going fucking insane with navigation. In case you aren't aware, iOS **does not** have an analogy for the Android \"swipe from right edge inward\" motion. Instead, you have to reach to the complete opposite side of the device to do 90% of \"back\" functions. I've tried to get used to it and it's just not getting better. This is a huge deal! This is something fundamental about my phone that affects literally every app and every aspect of the experience. * Notifications on iOS are completely bonkers. Much less control, and handling any specific notification takes 2x-3x times as many taps or swipes as it would on Android. Hard to see, hard to manage. * Typing is an exercise in frustration. Even with using 3rd party keyboards, it just doesn't work very well and doesn't feel natural. Trust me, I've been trying to get used to it, but I think Pixel typing was just one of those things where I didn't realize how good it was until it was taken away. I could go on and on, but I think it's really disappointing how the iPhone hardware is top notch, absolutely beautiful in hand, but the OS itself is so so so locked down and dare I say \"dumbed down\". The answer to most of my dozens of \"how do I do this\" questions has been some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\/not using it as intended\". It's just incredibly frustrating for it to get such fundamental things wrong about how the user interacts with the system. And some of it is so simple, it just boggles the mind what the designers are thinking over in Apple HQ. It's almost like they're making decisions just to be different, or based on a model of user interaction that assumes the user is computer-illiterate. Which, fair enough! But it's not for me. Anyway, I just went to best buy today to see the size of the P8 in person and from what I could tell, it\u2019s really similar to the P5, which is a huge selling point for me. Will wait for them to become generally available and then get around to selling my iPhone and purchasing the P8.","26":"So both my wifes Mazda 3 2012 and my Mazda 6 2011 are having bluetooth connection issues. We both have Google Pixel 8 Pros. Has anyone had any connection issues. It seems that it pairs to the car but doesnt actually connect. Any help out there?  UPDATE UPDATE!! GREAT NEWS! JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on\/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on\/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too. So theres definitely something with the new android jan update that has worked for me. I have also noticed that the BT connection is solid with out any skips or jitters.Give it a go.","27":"I just received them, maybe a mistake from Fnac... They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w7x9g1\/pixel_buds_pro_more_info\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Edit : 1 day laterHey there,I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w61knw\/comment\/ihbi45t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.# How did I get them earlier ?I just ordered them on Fnac. The \"Pre order\" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.# What's inside the boxWhen you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.# Design and comfortI thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Best regards redditors,Linkakox","28":"I haven't even had the phone for 24 hours yet so keep that in mind - these are very early impressions! Just thought I'd compare directly with my Pixel 3 whilst I still can, as I'll probably be trading the older phone in this weekend.Let's get this out of the way first. The bad:* Speakers are not as good as Pixel 3's front firers. They're tinnier, less punchy, and the stereo effect is more imbalanced towards the bottom speaker when holding the phone in landscape. They're serviceable for casual YouTubing and phonecalls\/podcasts but don't try and seriously play music on them. No crackle or distortion but just a notable downgrade vs Pixel 3. So far this is definitely the phone's Achilles heel.* Photos take a little longer (by a second or two) to process vs Pixel 3 due to no dedicated visual core. Not a huge difference by any means, but it's there.* Black smearing is still here at low brightness levels, albeit not as bad as on Pixel 3.Now for the more encouraging part! The good:* Display is a **monumental** upgrade over Pixel 3. I'll prove it - see [Pixel 3 here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jC6wMTo.jpg), and then [Pixel 5 here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OmCs8cs.jpg). Both phones were locked to 25% brightness. They both had the exact same image on the display (ignore the purple tint on the Pixel 5, that was just the camera struggling with the very low light conditions). You can't see anything in the Pixel 3 photo because it doesn't display the grey squares at all at that brightness level, everything is crushed into black nothingness. I have to crank Pixel 3 brightness to 35% to match Pixel 5's display at 0% to get the grey squares to the same level of visibility on both screens - that's a huge improvement for the new phone! ([Here's the link to the image with grey squares if you want to test it out on your phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bWPsANV.jpg)).* Performance seems smooth so far, navigating the UI is nice and fluent, animations look fluid. Apps launch quickly, phone feels snappy so far. I've logged into all the usual apps I had on Pixel 3 including known resource hogs (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Amazon for example). 90Hz provides a noticeable boost to scrolling vs 60Hz. Pixel 5 definitely keeps many more apps in memory than Pixel 3.* The aesthetic of the small, symmetrical bezels is really good! [Looks much more 'modern' than my Pixel 3.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FIfpXSf.jpg) Quite the stunner.* Battery life so far seems to be much better than Pixel 3 - I can't say that much yet because obviously it's very early days, haven't got a full day from it yet. But I can already see it drains much less per hour than the Pixel 3 in active use. Standby also seems better so far - 0% drain overnight (with no AOD).* Call quality is fine. I tested it with my brother. He sounded a bit more 'distant' than with my Pixel 3 but I could still make out his every word clearly (and my mum making random comments in the background from time to time haha). He did say that I sounded much better on his end vs my Pixel 3 (everyone has always complained about the quality of my voice from my Pixel 3 microphones).* Haptics are a bit better than Pixel 3. Tighter, more refined. If that makes sense? More precise, like iPhone haptics and less coarse rattling of the whole phone. It's hard to put into words. I prefer Pixel 5 haptics, that's what I'm saying.* Video is better on Pixel 5. 4K 60fps video is definitely nicer looking than Pixel 3's 4K 30fps. Haven't had much opportunity to properly test it out yet though. Same story story with ultrawide lens - looks fine at first impressions, haven't had opportunity to test it thoroughly yet though. Need more time to assess these new features.* Main sensor photos appear fine. Not much different from Pixel 3 to be honest, I can see a bit more detail when zooming into an image and the slightly wider aperture seems to help to capture a bit more light in dark indoor conditions. It's not a big difference though, I imagine most of these improvements were applicable to last year's Pixel 4 too. But still, it's the same great camera experience as always. [Here's a completely unedited photo of my fish that wouldn't stay still.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y559ZYk.jpg)* The fabric case is quite nice honestly. Nice grippy texture. Green Chameleon colour really melds well with the Sage model!That's probably enough for now (this has already evolved into a wall of text, oops). Overall, I am liking what I'm seeing so far. I'll of course keep sharing my findings as I use the phone more. Any questions I'll answer to the best of my ability.Hope this proves interesting to someone out there! \ud83d\ude42","29":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.","30":"People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.","31":"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.-----UPDATE-----Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility \u2764\ufe0f I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.-----------my response to how Google handled this--------Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line \"do no evil\" means you inherently \"do good\" cause apparently you just don't \"do\" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.----------------------- Other people ------------------------Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?Phone: Pixel 3OS: Android 11Service: Verizon","32":"Hey everyone, I know you're not big fans of negative opinions, but I wanted to share my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL after using it for almost 10 days. At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.","33":"**NOTE: Please see updates at the bottom**  **NOTE: Final Update 12\/14\/2022 will be found at the bottom of the post**I purchased a Google Pixel 5a back in April.

I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.**Updates:**I wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT)* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL](https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL)* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.* No the phone was NOT damaged* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of \"its not eligible, because its not eligible\"* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https:\/\/imgur.com\/Q2jvTh2](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Q2jvTh2)**Final Update 12\/14\/2022:**Thanks to the help of u\/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won't get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google's reputation which is well deserved. ","34":"Hey r\/GooglePixel,I\u2019m not super Reddit-savvy, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down.","35":"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers \/ tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending GoogleEdit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. - work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. ","36":"Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?","37":"I recently upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro and received the Gemini Advanced 12 month subscription as part of the purchase. Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like? I've used the Google ecosystem of products since day 1 and this is the most frustrated I've been with it's product.","38":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)","39":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.  For some context, I\u2019ve owned many iPhones starting with the iPhone 3G, 4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/x\/12pm\/14pm etc as well as many Nokia phones (N8,N9,N95,N97,N97 Mini, Lumia series etc), BlackBerries and of course Android phones (HTCs, Nexus 4,5,6P,Pixel 2XL, Pixel 7P,8P and now 9P XL).This is just an appreciation post for the Pixel 9 Pro\u2026.  While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season! ","40":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding.

[**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","41":"**\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer\\*\\*\\***This post is NOT another \"here's why the Pixel is better than the iPhone\" rant. **It's a rant against tech sites** who seem to only mention Android's customization as the primary advantage over iOS when making their comparisons. If you're here to reply with \"but iPhones are better because of x,y, and z,\" then please don't bother replying and move on to the next thread.**Original Post**Every Android vs iOS comparison I read [lists the iPhone advantages and then lists a few Android advantages](https:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/why-i-carry-iphone-and-android-phone). However, they always start off the Android section with the SAME advantage... Customization.Well guess what, iPhone users don't care about customization; otherwise, they'd be using Android. I'm here to lay out some actual, functional advantages to using Android (specifically, the Google Pixel series):1. File Management - not only can you easily access the internal file structure from the phone, you can plug it into a computer and read it like a flash drive. This makes file management SUPER easy and effective on Android.2. Mobile Data - Android does not restrict you from using your mobile data to download \"large\" files >150 mb. What's the point of having unlimited data plans if you have to connect to WiFi just to download a game or music album?3. Cross-platform Compatibility - seriously, why should I have to buy a $1,500 Mac Book just to send text messages from my computer? Android Messages works through ANY browser. Plus, NFC actually works for more than just mobile payments.4. Deeper 3rd Party App Integration - \"but, Snap Chat looks better on iPhone!\" ....FVCK SNAPCHAT!  I'm talking about 3rd party apps being crippled on iOS because iOS doesn't play nicely with anything that doesn't have an Apple logo on it. Take Google Photos for example. The key feature is the cloud backups to preserve your photos in case anything happens to your device. But if you have an iPhone, you can't even count on the app to backup photos unless you open the G\\_Photos app, manually start the backup process, and then don't switch to a different app because of my next point...5. True Multi-Tasking - forget the fact that Pixels can run split screen apps or picture in picture. I'm talking about simply starting a process on one app, and switching to another app WITHOUT the first app pausing the process. It's not really a smart phone if the iPhone can't run processes in the background.6. Everything Else - better notification management, faster LTE\/WiFi modems, fast charging included standard, native USB-C support, in-app settings management (seriously, I have to exit the app I'm using and dig through the long a\\*\\* general settings menu to change an app-specific setting?), more advance sharing options, and I'm sure there's a ton more...But in just 5 minutes, I was able to list a bevy of genuine advantages the Pixel series has over the iPhone series, and I did so without ONCE mentioning, \"But the customization!\" These tech reviewers need to start digging deeper than just their home screen layouts on these phones. No one is going to give Android any serious consideration if they think the only advantage is changing the shape\/color of the app icons.\/rant","42":"# Initial PostVery upset right now, as over a decade of Timeline data has been lost!* Last year (approx. Aug 2024), I followed all of the steps that had been emailed out to complete the conversation to local encrypted storage for timeline data.* My main phone is a Google Pixel 8, running Android 15 and generally the latest updates of all apps.* My Timeline settings were definitely set to \"**Backup: On; Auto-Delete: Never**\" last year, and backups would have been successfully uploading to the cloud backup for months.* Then suddenly on 09\/Mar\/2025, I noticed that my timeline data was mostly empty - losing over a decade of data.* When attempting to \"Restore\" from the cloud backup (*which is dated \"2 days ago\" as of now, so either 07\/Mar\/2025 or 08\/Mar\/2025*), - from any device including totally fresh ones - and **NO** data is returned from before \\~6pm GMT on Friday 07\/Mar\/2025.* This is despite the fact that I **KNOW** for certain that the decade of data \\*used\\* to be included in that backup before. (Because I changed phones late last year in November and everything was transferred over then).* After reading lots of other people's forum posts complaining about the same problem, it now doesn't seem related to specific phones \/ versions, as I've seen it happened to people with Samsungs and different Pixels, using anywhere from Android 12 to 15... (*It definitely just feels like someone at Google accidentally deployed the wrong thing or deleted something from production!*)* Some users report that their high level 'Places', 'Vists' and 'Countries' etc, still show the old totals. Unfortunatly mine have been reduced to patechic post-March 7th figures.Posting here, to see if this is effecting anyone else, and we can align with each other.*Note: My:* [first post on \/r\/google](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/google\/comments\/1j7u1k1\/maps_timeline_backup_has_lost_over_a_decade_of\/)*, and my* [community post on Google forums](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&sjid=10310876563270854239-EU).*Also, note: because there is a sea of Timeline support questions\/articles\/reddit posts\/etc. that are relating to the migration to local storage last year - this is NOT the problem here. I successfully migrated, and that was successful,*. ***Instead this is a sudden loss of previously backed-up data occurred in early March 2025.***\\-------------------------------------------------------------------# SummaryIt appears to me that, something out of our control (*possibly due to a bug in Google Maps app or purely on Google's servers*) caused the Timeline data to be **NOT ONLY**\u00a0deleted all pre-March 7th from **OWN LOCAL DEVICES (!!!)**, but **ALSO** has\u00a0**caused previously-successful \"Cloud Backups\" to over OVERWRITTEN with a backup containing no data from before March 7th...**I know this is the case for me because:1. Doing an import of the current cloud backup to a different new device contains no data from before March 7th.2. And I know for a\u00a0**certainty**\u00a0that that **SAME** cloud backup **USED TO** contain a decade of timeline data, because in November last year I did a factory reset of my device and all the data was loaded successfully after importing.I worry that, regardless of whether or not any potential bug is \"fixed\" in the Maps application going forward - for me and many others it might not make a blind bit of difference - as the data in the backup on Google's servers has gone, and could only possibly be restored by Google themselves in the back-end (*e.g. Internally restore a March 6th backup and enable users like me to be able to \"import\" that data backup*).And as far as I know, it has been **complete radio silence** from Google employees about this....On the Google Maps help community forums, the user '*Vishal Saini*' has been replying to anyone and everyone who posts about this, saying that \"*a bug may have caused this*\" and half-implying that a Google development team \"*may\"* be looking into it (*but I understand that he is not a Google employee and I have no reason to believe he has anymore information than we do...*). This is \\*not at all\\* reassuring because, as explained, I think this issue is going to require manual intervention by Google employees to re-consolidate\/make available each users' last successful backup pre-March 7th...As this is an issue **affecting at least** **~~dozens~~** **of users** who have cared enough to post online about it (*see below for a list*) - meaning that once you include all those who don't bother to post\/haven't noticed yet\/don't care - it's really likely an issue that is **affecting** **~~100s if not~~** **~~1000s~~** **of users**...*(****EDIT: Because within a couple of days, I have found many reddit posts; >50 community forum posts all posted in a single day, often with a couple of others sounding \"me too\" in the comments; and over*** [***620 people marking \"I have the same question\" to this one in 7 days so far***](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/329356095)***(!!!)

You can do this via:>`Phone's Settings > Location > Location Services > Timeline > Export timeline data`If this returns a small file, move to the steps below, but if returns a relatively large '.json' file (e.g. >1MB), then you likely have all the data contained in that file. It doesn't necessarily ever make it viewable in the Google Maps app, but at least you'd still have the data yourself... And you could then view it in another tool, such as:\u00a0[https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/](https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*(NB: I'm not verifying the safety of this particular viewer - but it's just an example of multiple that you find when googling, including self-hosted ones).* Unfortunately, for me this is only post-March 7th data.The following steps have apparently worked for people to recover, but unfortunately none have worked for me:1. Go into Timeline, and turn it off and then on again.2. Import from the timeline backups.3. Log in to Google Maps app from a totally fresh device.4.

I have talked about it [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/n0pifs\/update_on_my_refund_issue_with_google_for_my_lost\/).## I have added some updates for people who are suggesting chargebacks as an option, and also for people who think I am being impatient (which is subjective I think), and of course to people who think I am a fraudster. Also, I would like to point out that in no way do I think Google is not within their rights to investigate this, but for me this is more about customer experience, and my confidence in ever again ordering from Google vs any other brand (Amazon for e.g.). This isn't a case of something being delivered by UPS, and me contesting I never received it. The package has not been scanned since it reached UPS. It would require multiple people to screw up at various points to this being delivered to me, yet not reflecting on UPS record.I ordered a Pixel 5, and UPS apparently lost the shipment. And even though UPS has confirmed that the package never reached me, Google is still refusing to refund my money.I keep chatting with their team to get my refund. First 2 days, they would just tell me, \"we have escalated this, please wait\", when I would want to speak with the escalation agent, one chat agent told me no, and then disconnected the chat, even without waiting for a reply. Please note that at no point was I ever rude or abusive to anyone. I was slightly irate (rightfully so), but I just wanted some update.After 2 days, UPS said they lost the package, but Google said they want UPS to complete an investigation before they will refund my money. Even though I as a consumer should not assume any responsibility of a shipping mishap, and the claims process with UPS is Google's job, apparently, Google likes to hold customer's accountable for delivery mishaps and takes zero financial liability.If they would have just refund my money right away (like most companies would, when they failed to deliver a product), I would have gone and bought a Pixel 5, but now I would never want to deal with Google customer service again. Not only would I not buy a Pixel (or any Android phone), I have already cancelled my Youtube premium and music subscription as well. And also, the cloud infrastructure that I was planning to build (of all my data)Imagine you ordered something from Uber Eats, and your food is not delivered, and you are hungry, and Uber says they are conducting an investigation before they can refund anything. This is basically just like that. I am out a $1000 dollars and all Google has given me is 1 email per day that \"we are doing everything we can\".I understand things can go wrong with shipping, I also understand every company has its policies have, but   this is not a repair or a replacement (I can only imagine the horror of dealing with Google if there is ever a hardware issue). This was a case of a complete no show. Google issuing me a refund should not have depended on any investigation. This policy of their is highly unfair to the customers, and as far as I know is unheard of.Yesterday I even got an email saying it was escalated to the \"highest tier of support\", and I thought wow, something would happen now, but it seems the answer is still the same - waiting for the investigation, and just more apology that they are literally holding my money without interest, for no reason apart from the fact that they don't want to pay me before UPS pays their claim.I have been a long time Android\/Google loyalist, but this \"fuck you\" policy of Google has made me realize why so many prefer Apple over Google. If it wasn't for the amazing products Google engineers make and the maps\/asisstant\/search\/browser sync experience, absolutely no one would even think about buying Google products.Edit 1: I cannot do a charge back, not unless I want to lose my Google account of more than a decade.What is the timeline? Am I being just impatient? For people who want to know the exact timelines to understand whether I am being impatient, I guess whether I am being impatient, and how long is long enough is fairly subjective of course. Perhaps I am being unreasonable, or may be not. It all depends on what your experience of shipment generally is, and also how urgent is your requirement. So, I will mention the timeline here, and people can decide whether they think it's reasonable or not. Again, I don't think there is a right answer to this, and depends on each individual. It has been 1.5 weeks since the purchase, 1 week since the latest estimated delivery date, 1 week since the issue was escalated, and a little more than 1 week since UPS had any updates on their tracking. It took Google 3 days to initiate an investigation through UPS. I kept asking them if it is done, and they said it is, but when I would ask UPS, they would say they still haven't received a request for investigation. Now, I understand that UPS investigations take 10 business days, which is 2 weeks. Till now Google has not once confirmed that they will refund my money if the investigation is complete and it is finalized that I never received the phone. I asked them directly 2 times, and both times, all they have said is they will get back once the escalation is done.Why should Google refund you based on just your word? Agreed, but this wasn't a case of product delivered, but I am contesting it is not. It wasn't even as if UPS just forgot to scan the package at the time of delivery. They haven't scanned it since it reached their warehouse. I agree they still need to do a thorough investigation to find what exactly happened to the package, but it certainly isn't a case of them delivering it, and me saying I haven't received it.Why do I want a refund and not replacement? Because I would like to go out and buy a phone from somewhere else, and not wait for a replacement to be shipped. At this stage, I don't even want an immediate refund, I just need realistic timelines, so I know that if this is not refunded by my next billing cycle, how will I manage my finances if I buy another phone.Why did I not buy it from BestBuy or Carrier in the first place if I was in such rush? Because neither of them had the Sorta Sage in stock, and I didn't anticipate that Google would take this long to get me a phone. In retrospect, yes, I would have just gone with the all Black, but at the time, I didn't anticipate this.For all who are suggesting I am just trying to defraud Google. If even there is a way to defraud a company like Google (it's everywhere), it realistically would have taken a huge coordinated effort to pull something like this off. And all this for a phone??? Well, it's a possibility, but a very unrealistic one.","44":"(Plz feel free to skip to the bottom for the main question of this post!)I've been on Pixel since the 2XL (and also had a Nexus 5), currently on a 6 Pro, and I think I may be done with Google. There's always the meme of \"Google kills its best products,\" but unfortunately it is true. I was an avid user of Inbox, and was pretty bummed when that was unceremoniously cut. I gave Stadia a shot, and while I didn't like the business model, the technology worked pretty well; but that also got cut. Then with them ending the Pixel Pass 2 months before a full cycle (with the caveat that they're offering some compensation\/security to those who had already subscribed), I don't have faith in investing my time or energy into any of their services. Beyond that, I also generally have no faith in Google's data security \/ privacy - I've had my data compromised TWICE with Chrome (the first time was my fault, the second was not), so now I refuse to use it. They are also very keen to sell user data (even if anonymized), and that leaves me with a pretty acrid taste in my mouth. Beyond that, the 6 Pro has been a pretty bad device to me. Lots of inconsistency and crashes, the audio is really bad (both recording and playback, even after an RMA), bluetooth has been bad, battery is very bad, screen is just okay, the phone-specific services have been bad (esp google photos with their 'back up on the cloud' thing, it totally destroyed my folder structure and put stuff in random places), etc. I'll say that the camera is great, and that's basically the one saving grace haha. Basically, there's very little keeping me tied to the Pixel. And, to a greater extent, Android as a platform. I'm pretty close to jumping ship to iOS, but that's mainly because it's the only other viable option. Linux for mobile just isn't there yet, I played with Ubuntu Touch and it felt too preliminary for me. I've also played with iOS in the past and wasn't super fond of it; but at least Apple has good data privacy \/ security, and they seem committed to most of their services. Anyways, the point of this post is this: I'm curious what is tying you to Pixel as a device, and Android as a platform. I already have one foot out the door, but at least wanted to do some due diligence and see if I'm missing out on something which makes you feel passionately about it =] Thanks!! All the best","45":"I recently switched to a Pixel 3 XL from an iPhone X and wanted to give a quick review in case someone else is in the same boat.While my iPhone X was a solid and reliable device, after 7 years of little change I grew bored of iOS, especially compared to all the cool stuff Google is doing with the assistant and AI. Luckily I was in between carriers and needed to return my iPhone X to T-Mobile, leaving me the option to either renew and get another iPhone with the same familiar iOS, or try something new. I only wanted to go the Pixel route because it's theoretically the most bullet-proof option, so I switched to Google Fi and got a Pixel 3 XL (along with a Pixel Stand).2 weeks later and I'm pleased to admit the experience has been great and rarely do I miss iOS. That said, I went into this very open minded and prepared for trade offs in advance, ultimately making the switch from iOS to Android easier. Some of the things I did before switching to Android were:* USE THE TRANSFER CABLE that's provided in the box during setup. If you do anything, do this.* Replace all Apple apps with their equivalent Google apps. You can use 3rd party but I wanted the most seamless experience so went all Google (KeyChain passwords are a pain to transfer so I used this as an opportunity to update all my old passwords, which I needed to do anyway. Also if you have a lot of notes you'll need to individually copy\/paste them to Keep, which is a lot easier to do on the desktop browser)* Make sure your Apple data is backed up* Disable and unsubscribe from iMessage (unless you don't care about SMS texting)* Cancel any reoccurring Apple subscriptionsOnce I was fully switched over there was a slight adjustment period but after a day I was hooked. A few of my favorite features thusfar:* The assistant is genuinely in a league of its own. I find myself willingly using it way more often than I did Siri simply because I known I'll get the results faster than searching myself. I also love the squeeze feature because I don't need to sound like a crazy person in public yelling \"hey google\"* The way Android adapts to your habits is brilliant. Keep dismissing an annoying notification? It'll ask if you want to stop receiving it - not the app as a whole, but that certain message relating to the app, so you'll still see what you want to. Dim your screen a lot? It'll figure out the optimal brightness for every situation. Open Waze every day at 6am? It'll figure it out and have the app waiting for you to open. It's small things like this that makes Android disappear into the background.* Now Playing and the always on display are awesome. I can just glance at my phone and know the time, battery, messages and song playing.* I actually prefer Messages to iMessage. Group chats are the same, pics are high res, emojis are identical and you can search for them in the keyboard along with gifs, and you can text from ANY chrome browser so i no longer need my Apple account linked to my work computer.* Having Google Now access by swiping left on the home screen shows relevant news articles from all over the web and it gets better the more you use it. I've discovered some great stuff from it.* Digital Wellbeing is so much more useful and easier to understand than iOS' version.* Having Google Maps be the default for everything is amazing* Google Photos is creepy but also magic. I tagged 1 person and it automatically found a hundred more. I find myself searching for old photos based on memories, like \"Ben and I in New York together\" and it'll pull up that exact photo. It even works for pets, which makes for a big time waster.* The camera is amazing, we all know it.* Call Screening is awesome and is a unique bridge between texting and voicemail. I don't use it all the time, but when I do it makes perfect sense. For example, if I'm in a meeting and need to take a call but can't necessarily get up and walk out, I can find out what's important in real time and say I'll call them back in 5min.I'm sure I'm missing more, but you get the point, I'm a fan. That's not to say it's perfect nor that I don't miss certain aspects of iOS. Some things I wish were better:* I took for granted how smooth iOS and the iPhone X's gestures were. I miss swiping from the edges to get around and I'm still not completely use to it.* I also took for granted how often I use 3D touch, especially when typing to move the cursor around and select text. I find myself struggling to select\/copy\/paste text and editing anything is a chore.* If you have a Mac computer then using Airdrop and continuity to bounce between Safari tabs and copy\/paste text across devices instantly is sorely missed. Though Chrome does sync tabs and I can easily text myself something, it simply isn't as good. That said Google Photos and Drive are instantly synced to the cloud, which is must faster than iCloud that sometimes wouldn't sync photos until the next hour.* I can't pinpoint it, but apps don't feel as polished. For example, Instagram isn't as fluid and is difficult to scroll through, and some times even freezes.* The fingerprint sensor is fine but it has more false reads than I'd like and I wish it offered face unlock as a low-security option (at least for the Pixel Stand!)* Speaking of the Pixel Stand, it rarely works for me and I've read I'm not the only one. It sometimes doens't rapid charge, the photo album has never worked nor has the daily summary tab.* I don't hate Chrome, but the UI is a little confusing. I wish it had shortcuts to open a tab, favorites and history. It all takes 2-3 more steps than Safari.* \"Layering\" of the same app is VERY confusing at first. For example, when using the camera and switching to night sight it feels like you're switching to a separate app; the other controls disappear and an X appears that takes you back to the main camera. Why not just add it to the bottom scroll next to camera and video mode? Or even more frustratingly, when you use the home screen search widget it opens results in what looks like Chrome but is actually Google Now. So if you later return to Chrome your past searches and tabs aren't in it, so you need to return to the Google Now app to keep searching, which natively opens with a blank page deleting whatever it is you were looking at. Yes, I know there's a setting that opens Google Now searches in Chrome, but it's still counter-intuitive and requires more thinking than it should.*When uploading images from another app you're only able to see the main camera roll, albums are confined to Google Photos which makes no sense.There's a few more small quirks that make me go \"huh?\", but I have faith that Android Q will iron out a lot, sort of like how iOS 12 fixed all of iOS11 issues. I also believe the Pixel 4 will be even better and I hope the deign is more radical.**TLDR;** If you're on the fence, know that Android is more than capable and delivers an exciting new experience that doesn't leave you missing much from iOS. But also be aware that there are tradeoffs and it won't be as tightly integrated and screwed together as an Apple product, at least not for a little longer. That said, if you're in the market for a new phone then now is a better time than ever to switch. Apple isn't releasing anything exiting for a while, whereas Google is doing a lot of thoughtful stuff with AI that actually makes your life easier, and I don't think any of these things are on Apple's radar. For the time being I'm more optimistic in Google's future and am willing to invest more of my time\/money to see what they're capable of.","46":"I've been using a back up phone alot recently ( Motorola edge 40) and I've noticed a few things it does so much better than my main phone ( pixel 8 Pro)And it got me thinking.. For those of u who have used android phones from other manufacturers what is it that makes the pixel better for you? For me it was originally for the stock android experience but after using the Motorola I realised that I prefer Motorolas implementation... Shockingly. Things that moto does better imo1. Dual sim works better ( easy switching data service for sim provider via quick toggle) 2. Hide ssid when using WiFi hotspot3. Shows WiFi standard in status bar when using WiFi 6 and above 4. No 5g restrictions ( the same sim in my pixel does not allow for 5g but works fine with the moto) 5. No bluetooth codec restrictions (lhdc, ldac aptx adaptive all there)6. Dolby atmos works well for me and is more useful that spatial audio on the pixel. With the pixel I always come back for the camera though and of course the excellent software support. Correct me if I'm wrong but right now only the following manufacturers have a ui\/Ux experience close to stock1. Google 2. Motorola 3. Sony And the pixel experience is moving us further away from true stock android? Does this mean that Sony and motorola are the manufacturers closest to real stock android right now?","47":"I know there have been a couple of these lately and I've been inspired by those other users to write about my experience as well. My background in summary: Android user since 2010, ditched it for iPhone formally in 2018. Tried out Pixel 6A in 2022 but quickly returned it, now back to Pixel 7 for the foreseeable future. As far as Android goes I had always been an AOSP purist. My fondest memories of using Android were always using AOSP roms on 3rd party phones and of course, on Nexus devices of which I had many back in the day. Pixel was the obvious next step when the Android itch started hitting me again. When I switched to iPhone I was coming off that era of flashing and rooting, so I wanted stability over everything. iPhone certainly provided that and during that time I also got in deep with the Apple ecosystem. Fast forward to 2022, I was in NYC and visited a Google store. The Pixel 6A was on sale for cheap so I decided to grab one. It was pretty good, but at that time I was still sorely attached to iOS so I returned it. There were key features in iOS that were still just too important to me like Car Play and Apple Card (the latter of which I've stopped using recently). This is where my stubborness comes from.Things started changing this year though, with iOS 17 out in the wild I felt like things were starting to feel really old to me. I'm now gonna talk about how Pixel fixes many of these issues for me:1. Overall interface fluidness - when people say iOS is smooth, they're not wrong. But using it long enough you realize how SLOW everything is in reality. Things load but there's a delay before you can actually interact with them. Android never had that problem, but with this 90hz display and with how much the UI has improved, this is one area that I'm thoroughly enjoying.2. Gboard - can't begin to express how much I missed it, I had simply forgotten how good it was. Autocorrect works well, gesture typing is better and has more useful features, and the GIF search actually nails what I'm looking for every time. iOS's keyboard was always too aggressive to correct things when I didn't want it to, which is a problem I also face on Mac constantly. 3. Notifications - do I even need to go into detail here? iOS is a mess in this regard. I still feel like making the lock screen view and the notification center be the same thing was a mistake when it was first implemented in iOS 11. What's worse is they've kept changing how notifications work over the years, so just when you became used to interacting with them a certain way, they change it. Android's implementation is still as good as the day I left it. 4. The look of the UI - I used to be a sucker for iOS's translucency-obsessed design, but it was wearing off on me. Material You rocks. 5. THE FREEDOM - you're telling me I can patch Reddit Sync and still use it? Say no more. Android very obviously trumps iOS in this area. Now some things that I'm having sort of a hard time with that iOS really did well:1. Android Auto - the big problems I had with AA back in 2018 when I owned a Galaxy were the poor audio quality and the battery drain. iOS is superior in both of those areas, especially with charging. Every single iPhone I've owned always charged comfortably, while every Android phone I've owned doesn't. I've decided to get a Moto MA1 and an Anker fast charger to remedy that, but it sucks that I have to invest in separate gear just to have my phone not lose battery while using it in my car. 2. Passwords - Google password manager just doesn't work me. I easily exported all my Keychain passwords to a CSV file but the page to import them never opens. I managed to do it on Chrome desktop through the browser's settings but for some reason they just never synced. The password manager import page on the Pixel itself also does not work. Quite disappointing. 3. Apps - some very specific apps, namely my local bank, still has a very outdated interface on Android while the iOS version recently got a major refresh. Otherwise, most of the apps that I use have pretty good parity. Overall, I'm loving my Pixel so far. It's just what I wanted at the moment. Feel free to ask any questions, I'm down to discuss my experience in transitioning after so long.","48":"The last Google phone I had was the Nexus 6P at launch, [remember when phones came is cool packaging and included everything](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/McZQBtO.jpeg)? Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https:\/\/imgur.com\/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons\/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my \"Google\" folder is [even bigger](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify\/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+\/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a \u00a31400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light.","49":"I am a faithful Android user, having gone through the original G1, HTC Sensation, the Nexus 4, the Moto X, the OG Pixel, and most recently the Pixel 3. I briefly used an iPhone 6 when my OG Pixel suddenly stopped charging and my younger brother was gracious enough to let me borrow an extra phone he had for a couple weeks. At the time, iOS was significantly different and as a user who loved the customization Android affords, I hated the iPhone without question. This time, I took my Pixel 3 rafting without a proper waterproof cover and drowned the phone. I tried taking it to UBreakIFix and while super friendly, they were unable to bring the phone back to fully functional. So I have temporarily switched to my wife's old iPhone X running iOS 14.5 and I have honestly learned a lot from my time using it over the past month. My disclaimer is I'm not a power Apple user and so some of my issues I describe below might have workarounds that I was too lazy to research so forgive me for those, and because it's such an old device I'm not commenting on hardware including the camera (though I'd guess most people recognize Apples hardware itself is gorgeously constructed overall). Nonetheless, I thought as fellow dedicated Android users, you might be interested in what I've learned -Pros:1)  FaceID is way better than I could have ever imagined. Holy shit it's fucking legit. Even in low light, it's pretty impressive, and even on a 4 year old device the speed is impressive. The major oversight here is with the pandemic FaceID becomes useless in public spaces and you have to pull down your mask and click \"try FaceID again\" which is mildly annoying2) Powerbeats Pro pairing with the iPhone is just gorgeous in its simplicity and speed. My issues with my Powerbeats connecting to my phone disappeared with the iPhone. I recognize this is an unfair comparison due to the special chip for compatibility between the devices. I've seen videos of how smooth this pairing is but goddamn. I think Pixel buds and Samsung buds do the same with their respective devices though the Beats have better audio quality (hence why I own the Beats)3) After sharing a screenshot Apple gives you the option to delete that screenshot. that's awesome and over time I loved how smooth the process of taking, editing, sharing, and deleting the screenshots are.4) Its annoying that all audio and video calls from the device are listed in on section (see #17 below) but at the same time it's kind of amazing that all your app calls and videos are easily accessible in one place which makes redialing through that app (such as Duo) really easy which is pretty damn cool.5) I like the three beeps that lets you know a call is disconnected.6) The \"Ask App Not To Track\" prompt is incredible. There's really nothing on Android (yet?) that comes close to the simplicity of this prompt. And reaaaaally opened my eyes on how many of the apps I use are thirsty for data on my use. And I loved that the iPhone would verify that I'm okay with an app accessing my location in the background if the app was constantly grabbing my location.Cons:1) the widgets are cool but are years behind for the most part though 'Stack' is actually legit 2) setting up your home screen is way more work intensive than Android and not nearly as pretty nor customizable and if you want to put an app in a specific section of the screen, you have to plan how you will get it there.3) there's no easy or straightforward way to restore your WhatsApp chats across platforms - this is less an iPhone deficit than a WhatsApp deficit but the fact the WhatsApp app on iPhone can't access your WhatsApp data directly from Google Drive is a major oversight. I imagine I'll face the same issue (reversed) once I get the Pixel 6. There are third party solutions but probably defeats the whole \"end to end encryption\" function that is an essential WhatsApp selling point4) contact syncing is annoying and even multiple hours after setup my texts were showing up as from different people's phone numbers instead of their names - this resolved after about 24 hours but the iOS migration app developed by Apple did a weird thing where all my previous group chats became separate threads including my number so when I sent a message on the same thread from iPhone, I would receive the message I just sent. So I ended up having to recreate all my group chats again. Super annoying.5) why isn't there a way to make Google Assistant default (instead of Siri?) If this existed I'd be hard pressed to find a complete Android trump over iPhone. But you've gotta open the assistant app. You can't make the Google search widget trump the iOS search bar and the Google search bar doesn't have app access like it does in Android which also is annoying6) This is Google's fault more than iPhones but it's a disadvantage to a user completely baked into the Google ecosystem: the fragmentation of reminders across Calendar and Assistant is a huge issue making Google Reminders way way way less useful on iPhone than Android. I imagine the workaround would be using Apple Reminders which I'm sure would work great but I have a Google Home so then I'd have even more fragmentation7) the lack of screenshot copy:paste is a bummer and selecting text is way more annoying (what the fuck why is it so annoying?), and pasting text is similarly difficult, to the point of making copy\/pasting a huge chore. And I love sharing information I've copied! So this sucks hard.8) the way the keyboard works sucks and somehow typing is less accurate which makes no sense since I'm still using Gboard. And the keyboard will randomly switch back to the iPhone keyboard. Which is also so annoying.9) I can't really interact with the widgets without it just opening the app which really sucks10) The keyboard doesn't autopopulate email addresses and names (again confusing since I'm using Gboard) maybe because it doesn't have as much access as Gboard does on Android? But it's super annoying and slows down phone use to have to type out your email address every time11) How has iOS not found a better notification tray and something other than the damn red dots. I hate those red dots so much. Why doesn't the red dot disappear after you've cleared a notification from the notification tray?  Or even sometimes after you've opened the app? What the fuck? Now that's some dumb shit. On further review, this seems to only be true for certain apps, but still annoying 12) The lack of ability to snooze notifications is also a huge bummer13) Just showing all emoji colors when searching for emojis instead of long pressing to pick the emoji of your choice is also stupid14) Lack of Bitmoji integration into Gboard is also sad15) Because of the lack of proper access to file organization for the Google Photos app, the app is much messier on the iPhone and pulls all pictures from the device into the app which is super annoying, there's definitely a workaround for this but then you can't see those pictures at all. This really blows. If you were a dedicated Apple user this would be a non issue as you'd use Apple Photos so I will note this is more of a problem for people dedicated to Google Photos16) Why can't you click in the middle of words to fix your typing? That is some seriously dumb shit17) Why does the iPhone default to include all FaceTime calls with phone calls in the same section? And if you press the contact it would be wonderful to verify that you want to video before dialing the way Android does.18) The lack of a back gesture is so painful. As someone with a small hand, it's so much harder to reach for the top of the screen to go back to the previous screen\/app19) Chrome is my default browser. Why does the iPhone keep opening Safari? This is a very small frustration but still frustrating20) Why does Yelp only use Apple Maps? That's super annoying. This seems like SUCH an easy fix but alas, in some ways it makes sense Apple wants reign over some items21) Spotify in CarPlay does not work nearly as smoothly as Apple Music does for my wife. Not sure if this is a software limitation or a device limitation though.TL;DR: iOS 14.5 has a lot to offer overall, but power Android users and\/or Android users baked into the Google ecosystem will have a tough time completely smoothly using an iPhone. This is not exactly shocking information but maybe the software details I listed above will be helpful or useful to anyone who finds the Apple hardware incredibly compelling.","50":"People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.","51":"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.-----UPDATE-----Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility \u2764\ufe0f I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.-----------my response to how Google handled this--------Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line \"do no evil\" means you inherently \"do good\" cause apparently you just don't \"do\" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.----------------------- Other people ------------------------Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?Phone: Pixel 3OS: Android 11Service: Verizon","52":"**NOTE: Please see updates at the bottom**  **NOTE: Final Update 12\/14\/2022 will be found at the bottom of the post**I purchased a Google Pixel 5a back in April.

I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.**Updates:**I wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT)* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL](https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL)* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.* No the phone was NOT damaged* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of \"its not eligible, because its not eligible\"* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.  Check your facts before making accusations:[https:\/\/imgur.com\/Q2jvTh2](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Q2jvTh2)**Final Update 12\/14\/2022:**Thanks to the help of u\/dmziggy I finally got a replacement from Google.  However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won't get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google's reputation which is well deserved. ","53":"I'm absolutely floored and frustrated, and I need to share this cautionary tale. My mom, mid-60s and not exactly a tech wizard, is currently locked out of her entire digital life, and it's all because her Google Pixel 6 decided to abruptly brick itself.Here's the breakdown:* **The Sudden Death:** A few days ago, her Pixel 6 just went dark. No warning, no signs. A lab couldn't revive it.* **The Recovery Nightmare:** My mom, bless her heart, apparently never set up a separate recovery email. Or, if she did, it was the same email she's now locked out of.* **The Google Voice Trap:** Her recovery phone number is her old US Google Voice number. She and my dad moved overseas less than a year ago and got a local number, but, as you can imagine, changing recovery numbers wasn't a priority for her.* **The Password Paradox:** She actually remembers her Google password, but it seems she got locked out after multiple attempts (or some other Google security measure). Now, it's forcing verification via that US Google Voice number, which is inaccessible because the phone is dead.* **The Chromebook Betrayal:** She has a Chromebook, which I thought would be a saving grace. Nope. It mysteriously signed her out, and it's also requiring verification via the same inaccessible number.* **The Fallout:** All her important accounts\u2014health portals (MyChart), Facebook, everything\u2014are tied to that Google account. She's essentially lost access to her medical records and social connections.I'm beyond frustrated. This is a complete disaster. We've opened a new email, but it's a band-aid on a gaping wound.Seriously, how is this not happening to more people, especially older folks? Phones can just die, and if you don't have robust recovery options, you're screwed.**My Plea to You:*** Go. Now. Check your recovery email and phone number. Make sure they're up-to-date and accessible.* Set up multiple recovery options.* Consider a legacy contact.* Get those authenticator app offline codes and store them somewhere safe.* Back up everything, and test your backups.* Educate your older family members.It's insane how much we rely on these devices and accounts, and how easily it can all be taken away.Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.TL;DR: Mom's Pixel 6 died, she's locked out of her Google account, and therefore, her entire digital life, because of outdated recovery info. Check your recovery options NOW.","54":"Hey r\/GooglePixel,I\u2019m not super Reddit-savvy, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down.","55":"**Hey** r\/GooglePixel , we\u2019re Spigen!To celebrate the upcoming release of the Pixel 9 series, we're hosting a giveaway to show our appreciation for all the love (and feedback) this sub has given us over the years.

Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers \/ tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending GoogleEdit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. - work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. ","57":"I recently tried to use the Pixel 7 (coming from the Pixel 4a, used the Pixel 2 previously) and I just can't get used to the size difference.I'm not sure if there are others who experience the same thing, but 6.3\" for a phone seems to be on the larger\/near unusable side for me. It's not even being able to reach across the width of the screen, it's how tall the thing is and cumbersome it is to carry around. It feel slippery with the glass, the bump doesn't work for holding it with smaller\/regular sized hands as well.I'm curious if others have experienced the same thing. I imagine this shift to larger screens is matching the time and what sales figures dictate, but Google - please consider those of us who enjoy a smaller phone!Edit: First, lots of mentions of the Pixel 6a. Although it has a smaller screen, it has nearly the same footprint as the Pixel 7, so it's simply not a \"small\" phoneSecond, Asus Zenfone 9. I'm not sure how well it will work with my phone plan, but I'm willing to give it a shot, especially because it's quite close to stock android. I may update with a later post! Not sure if that's allowed though, as it's technically not Pixel-related.Final update (in case anyone is reading): Zenfone wasn't for me. Camera wasn't good at all, and software support is too lacking to justify. Going to hold out as long as I can with the 4a. Might have to jump into the world of iPhone in a year...","58":"Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?","59":"Hi everyone,We're excited to announce the newest additions to #teampixel: meet the Pixel 4a.&#x200B;To learn more about the ideas and innovation that went into our newest Pixel check out our [blog](https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/pixel\/pixel4a-new-helpful-google-phone), and find the tech specs [here](https:\/\/store.google.com\/product\/pixel_4a_specs).The device is available in select countries on the [Google Store](https:\/\/store.google.com\/us\/category\/phones).&#x200B;***Pixel 4a FAQs*****Where can I order the device?**Pixel 4a is now available for pre-order in the US on the [Google Store](https:\/\/store.google.com\/category\/phones) and on [Google Fi](https:\/\/fi.google.com\/about\/phones\/).

If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.","61":"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.-----UPDATE-----Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility \u2764\ufe0f I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.-----------my response to how Google handled this--------Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line \"do no evil\" means you inherently \"do good\" cause apparently you just don't \"do\" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.----------------------- Other people ------------------------Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?Phone: Pixel 3OS: Android 11Service: Verizon","62":"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers \/ tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending GoogleEdit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. - work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. ","63":"Hey Pixel owners!Just wanted to share my experience using Google phones for a decade and also why i decided to give another brand a try for now. **TLDR: I feel like i've been a beta tester for google since the Pixel 6 and upwards.**I've been using google phones since the Nexus 6P and instantly fell in love with them! The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?","64":"So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall. Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!","65":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)","66":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.  For some context, I\u2019ve owned many iPhones starting with the iPhone 3G, 4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/x\/12pm\/14pm etc as well as many Nokia phones (N8,N9,N95,N97,N97 Mini, Lumia series etc), BlackBerries and of course Android phones (HTCs, Nexus 4,5,6P,Pixel 2XL, Pixel 7P,8P and now 9P XL).This is just an appreciation post for the Pixel 9 Pro\u2026.  While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season! ","67":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.","68":"Why did they change this? Google Podcasts was lean and mean and just the way I liked it. I had my subscriptions and had no need to go through 15 layers just to download and listen to a podcast. And it was easy to \"explore\" other Podcasts and come across something interesting in my explore feed (my only gripe was that I couldn't get shit like Shapiro or other right wing grifters out of my Explore feed).Now on YouTube Music, it's a bloated home screen full of extraneous shit. It defaults to the podcast video unless otherwise specified. I've downloaded the audio versions, but since i have my settings set to only \"stream\" when connected to WiFi, it seems like they only actually download a small percentage of the time. There have been multiple times where I download a podcast, see the checkmark verifying that, and then when I step outside it kicks out. I'm sure there are easy enough solutions to this, maybe, but I legitimately hate the changeover. It sucks. Simple isn't a bad thing.Edit: Appreciate all the suggestions and will take a look into them. Also glad to hear I'm not the only one baffled by this stupidity. But even with these other options - the reason I went with the Pixel is because I liked the simplicity. I liked not having to depend on various outside apps or bloat to take advantage of my phone.Edit 2: A month later, but I'm still getting responses so I figured I'd mention - I've been using Pocketcasts and so far, so good. Not quite as seamless as Google Podcasts, but much better than YT Music.","69":"# Update 7\/19\/24Google's team has identified a solution for people experiencing issues after factory resetting your Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a.

You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","71":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market. NOT a member of Google's review free phone group.**Proof I have the phone**https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XrSz0iA**Device Info HW Screenshots**https:\/\/imgur.com\/Rk29cdo**Size** Smaller than Pixel 7, but slightly wide and taller than Pixel 6a. The 6a would still be the best one handed phone below $500 IMHO. Above $500 it would be Galaxy S23 (never had the Zenfone 9 to compare).**Design** Same as Pixel 7, they did make the display flush with the frame like on Pixel 7. If you thought Pixel 7 had sharp edges then Pixel 7a also has them. ~~Plastic frame~~ Metal frame since 6a has metal frame, and plastic back since its not cold to touch on the frame like Pixel 7. Volume rockers and power button have moved down a bit when compared to Pixel 6a. **Hardware** Tensor g2, 8gb ldppr5 samsung ram, goodix finderprint, face unlock on deck, samsung display, stereo speakers. **Weight**6.8oz or 193gthe pixel 7 comes out to 197g on the same scalethe pixel 6a with a screen protector comes to 187g**Display** Same size as Pixel 6a, 90hz confirmed. UI is smooth as Pixel mostly are unless you switching from a 144hz phone and scroll through twitter like crazy in which case you will find it laggy. Colors are good, not S23 quality but good. Bezels are bigger as compared to Pixel 6a. Maybe because of frame wrap around display design.On Pixel 6a, display sits a bit above the frame. Not good for direct sunlight just like Pixel 7 & Pixel 6a. Pixel 6a screen protector will work on Pixel 7a, will be close but will line up.**Battery** 4300mah per device info hw app. 18-20w wired charging per the usb metered cable I have. Wireless charging confirmed. No reverse wireless. **Biometrics**Under display fingerprint scanner (NOT ultrasonic) is as fast or slow as Pixel 7. Does not unlock with unrecognized fingerprint (like it did on Pixel 6a at launch). Face Unlock on deck. **Sound & Haptics**Stereo speakers are decent, and haptics are same as Pixel 6a. Not Pixel 7 or Galaxy S23 class.**Software**Running March 2023 security, and October 2022 Play System. No updates available, might be released on launch day. I dont see spatial audio option, but clear calling is present. **Camera** Gcam version is 8.8.225.What can I say, its a Pixel. Pictures are Pixel quality. Main and wide angle pictures are both 16.1mp. Main is f\/1.9 and wide angle is f\/2.2. front is f\/2.2, 12.2mp pictures. Front camera can do 4k, no option to switch between 30 and 60fps, so am assuming its 4k30 only. I dont see Action mode or cinematic mode as a camera option. Do see long exposure.

Used Pixels the last 5-6 years, going from a Pixel 2 to 3a to most recently a 5. IMO the 5 was (is?) literally a perfect phone, the fingerprint reader is 100% accurate (with the tape hack), it STILL takes amazing pictures, amazing battery performance even after 3 years, etc etc. If it wasn't losing security updates I would continue to use it. However, recently I decided to try to embrace iOS considering a lot of the other tech in my house is Apple. I have multiple sets of AirPods, M1 Mac, as well as an Apple TV. I also wanted to feel what iMessage and Facetime were like after being denied them for so long. I got an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB on launch day and have been using it the last ~month. My impressions:### The Good* Of course, beautiful hardware. Definitely the best industrial design in the world for consumer electronics. * Performance hiccups are virtually nonexistent. * When you do things the Apple Way, or go 100% 1st party, it really does work well. Some examples would be things like the 1st party Mail app, Airpods switching seamlessly between MacBook to iPhone to Apple TV. Spatial Audio. ### The Bad* When you *don't* go 100% first party, or do things the Apple Way, the result is painful. Eg, not being able to set Google Maps to be the default mapping application is pretty annoying. * iMessage is cool but I've noticed that both Google and Apple appear to be converging onto some sort of frankenstein protocol where \"reacts\" from either system show up correctly on the other. I had a bit of an \"oh shit\" moment when I first texted someone on Android from my iPhone and they reacted to a message with a thumbs up and it showed up...fine. Same as how I could see iPhone reacts on Pixel. Okay. So really the benefit is just...read receipts, typing notifs, and high quality image sharing? * Facetime is awesome - but I can get an iPad for that seeing as the main use would be showing off my kid to his grandparents. * The camera is good, but...only perhaps marginally so compared to my 3 year old Pixel 5? This I think was the most surprising. I expected to be \"wowed\" by the camera considering the attention Apple gives it - and it's really just okay. I think I did not appreciate how far ahead Google is with computational photography. I\u2019m heard iPhone dominates when it comes to video and I don\u2019t doubt that. However I rarely shoot videos, or if I do, they\u2019re just for fun. * Photos management is a mess on iOS. This one was a big surprise to me. I thought as a \"creator's platform\" it would offer a lot more flexibility in terms of organization and management, not the case. iCloud is a very poor, unintuitive system. Pretty clearly designed for people who will get lost if any kind of folder system is introduced. ### The Ugly* I feel like I'm going fucking insane with navigation. In case you aren't aware, iOS **does not** have an analogy for the Android \"swipe from right edge inward\" motion. Instead, you have to reach to the complete opposite side of the device to do 90% of \"back\" functions. I've tried to get used to it and it's just not getting better. This is a huge deal! This is something fundamental about my phone that affects literally every app and every aspect of the experience. * Notifications on iOS are completely bonkers. Much less control, and handling any specific notification takes 2x-3x times as many taps or swipes as it would on Android. Hard to see, hard to manage. * Typing is an exercise in frustration. Even with using 3rd party keyboards, it just doesn't work very well and doesn't feel natural. Trust me, I've been trying to get used to it, but I think Pixel typing was just one of those things where I didn't realize how good it was until it was taken away. I could go on and on, but I think it's really disappointing how the iPhone hardware is top notch, absolutely beautiful in hand, but the OS itself is so so so locked down and dare I say \"dumbed down\". The answer to most of my dozens of \"how do I do this\" questions has been some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\/not using it as intended\". It's just incredibly frustrating for it to get such fundamental things wrong about how the user interacts with the system. And some of it is so simple, it just boggles the mind what the designers are thinking over in Apple HQ. It's almost like they're making decisions just to be different, or based on a model of user interaction that assumes the user is computer-illiterate. Which, fair enough! But it's not for me. Anyway, I just went to best buy today to see the size of the P8 in person and from what I could tell, it\u2019s really similar to the P5, which is a huge selling point for me. Will wait for them to become generally available and then get around to selling my iPhone and purchasing the P8.","73":"So both my wifes Mazda 3 2012 and my Mazda 6 2011 are having bluetooth connection issues. We both have Google Pixel 8 Pros. Has anyone had any connection issues. It seems that it pairs to the car but doesnt actually connect. Any help out there?  UPDATE UPDATE!! GREAT NEWS! JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on\/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on\/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too. So theres definitely something with the new android jan update that has worked for me. I have also noticed that the BT connection is solid with out any skips or jitters.Give it a go.","74":"Not sure why, but I just wanted to put this somewhere and I found this Reddit to be the most fitting. I just want to release some steam.Me and my wife have been a Pixel (and Nexus) user from day one. Imported Pixels from other countries, just to be able to use them: USA (Pixel 1 and 5), Germany (Pixel 2XL, 3, 4, 4XL and 6) and next to this the Nexus 5, 5X and 6P (a.k.a. the skateboard or banana). Convincing my family to also go for the A-series of the Pixels and they really like them. They're not power users: 3G connectivity is fine, pictures should be good and battery life of 1 day is fine.Only, since I have replaced my Pixel 5 for an 8 (finally a smaller one!), due to a bad battery, I have been struggling. I know - especially from the Nexus-era - day-one devices aren't always great and you could need a couple of weeks for the software to get bug-free. Not really had this problem with my other Pixels, but that's mainly because I've never bought them new.I'm using the Pixel 8 for almost a month now and I feel like I have paid 675 EUR for a mid-range device with a great camera (that has to be said), but very bad battery performance and connectivity issues. My Pixel 8 will not last a day, even with 2x 45 minutes of wireless charging in my car when commuting. During wireless charging and wireless Android Auto, it gets super hot (even without a case) that my music will stutter. When picking it up to see, it feels very hot as well and it even states a warning about low performances due to the internal temperature.Since a week or so, I have disabled 5G as I have read that 5G drains the battery even faster due to a not-so-optimized modem. It is a bit better now, but only with about 10% in the late afternoon. I don't even use social media: I mainly use my phone to chat via Whatsapp (which I also do mostly via my Macbook), scroll through Reddit (is that social media?) and listen to music, but only in my car. I browse from time to time, but that is mostly it. No games, no movies, no streams.I kinda regret my so-called upgrade as it most definitely doesn't feel like an upgrade. I don't want to use any other Android brand as I believe a company that creates both the hardware and the software should provide the best experience: Apple iPad, Apple Macbook, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel. It is true for most devices in this row and it has been true for the Pixel series as well, up until now. I even kinda feel like I should have gone for the iPhone 15, while I don't even like Apple that much: I mean, it works flawlessly as a laptop to me and my iPad for drawing is also great, but I don't pick up my iPad that much for any other app. I mostly use my phone and I have been a proud Android user forever, since I switched from a Nokia with keyboard to the OnePlus One.**Edit 1:** I don't even have high refresh rate on. Just rocking 60 Hz.**Edit 2:** Small update: I have set back everything to the settings I have had before, being:- 5G enabled- Adaptive connectivity- BT enabled (and NFC\/GPS)- No smooth display (so 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz adaptive)- Dark mode- Previous default dark backgroundI have been using my phone now for about 7 hours and am at 48%. Working from home, so great WiFi connectivity. Nothing really strange here, only in my Batteryusage overview I see:- 19% Maps (SOT: 12 min. \/ Background: 9 min.)- 16% Spotify (Background: 20 min.)- 10% Android Auto (Background: 1 hour 23 min.)Rest is 5% or smaller.I did drive my car today, 2x 10 min. with Wireless Android Autio (yes, I have a USB-C cable laying in my car now, but I wanted to test out the 'original 'situation'). I did not use Maps and I did not use Spotify. Although, both are enabled (Spotify paused) with Android Auto in my overview screen.So, I think Android Auto + the fact that AA uses a lot of these resources as well, take a lot of the battery juice remaining.Next drive I will use wired AA and see what that will give. Most likely, less impact from AA, but still the same impact from Maps and Spotify even when not actively in use.**Edit 3:** I have checked my old Pixel 5 via the ADB commands on this Reddit shared: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gge9cd\/reading_battery_health_statistics_actual_capacity\/ - I find that my Pixel 5 has 665 cycles and 3408 mAh left from the original 4080 mAh. I am thinking of replacing the battery, but do you think this would help? It's a relieve just to hold that phone, so light.A reputable repair company charges 60 EUR for a battery replacement, only they say there is a high chance of breaking the screen, which is on my own risk and costs 299 EUR. I won't be doing this myself and I'm really not looking for another second hand - used - phone from 2020 with the same battery quality.**Edit 4:** I'm at 3 hours 3 min. of SOT, still with the 3 above being the biggest battery drainers. Now on 20%, 17% and 11% respectively. Didn't use AA in the meantime. Got 16% battery left.**Edit 5:** I'm at 3 hours 20 min. of SOT at 1%. Battery saving kicked in at 10%. SOT is 7% of the total of system. My wife has a Pixel 6 and has 5 hours of SOT and 30% remaning. She is using Instagram, Snapchat, etc. socials, Vinted\/Chrome (shopping) and YouTube and such all day.I also see Mobile network has a total of 19 min. but is 56% of the total battery used. This is outrageous!**Edit 6:** Another day another test. I'm ay 51% right now with 51% SOT. I have disabled 5G again as it couldn't find any network, so back on 4G again which at least is stable. Most used app is WhatsApp with 13% battery usage. Mobile network at 39% (been out a lot today). Will result in about 3 to 4 hours of SOT by the end of the day.","75":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it.","77":"I've had my pixel 8 pro for at least a month now and I'll go over to the main points but the title says the main thing.Camera: The camera shoots video better than professional cameras with perfect stabilization, 4k60fps framerate stable videos, the photos are perfect because of the ai running on the TPU chip, I don't mind the little loading after taking a photo because it makes them perfect even in the most unlikely and worst conditions. The 5x optical zoom does the difference too.UI and UX: The pixel experience is perfect, no bloatware, attention to the detail, perfect UI, simple, easy to root or unlock bootloader if you're that kind of person, It all couldn't be better. Kudos to Google for that.Hardware and performance:CPU is great, GPU is not the best but can run any game at **max settings** **at at least 50fps**, this includes genshin impact and fortnite at max settings btw. The TPU allows for lightning quick ai photo perfection, recording summarization, audio s\u00e9paration in video, message remixing and more. Also 12gb ram which is perfect. Build quality: Couldn't be better the phone itself is smooth to the touch, beautiful, doesn't break easily if you don't throw it on the floor, stable on a flat surface despite the camera and moreScreen: Georgous, adaptative refresh rate means always on display consumes about 0.7% battery per day if always on. Adaptative refresh rate also triggers when content on the screen doesn't move aka when you read which makes the device last multiple days. It's also OLED of super AMOLED I forgot so the colors are perfect and accurate and beautiful.Overheating: Doesn't, heats just a little bit while heavy gaming but not that bad (not **over**heating)Fingerprint sensor: It's optical so if your screen is dirty or your finger is wet it won't work well and even sometimes when everything is right it won't work, it will tho if you set your main finger two times work perfectly every time except if wet or way too dirty.Face unlock: Everything perfect except it doesn't work in the dark if youre too far from your screen because not enough light. It also detects if your eyes are closed or if you're not looking at it in which case it wont unlock.Battery life: On TikTok lasts an average of nine hours because dynamic refresh rate can't kick in, on heavy gaming 5 for the same reason and also heavy processing, for light gaming 8 because the dynamic refresh rate cant kick in either and processing, while for reading it lasts multiple days. If you use this phone normally it will last one day or two before requiring to charge, it also has adaptative charging so if you charge at night and you setup bedtime mode it'll turn on bedtime mode disabling notification for the night and charging your phone to about 80% and then it'll charge slowly hitting 100% when your alarm rings, slow charging preserves battery. The part of this phone that consumes way too much battery is the modem which is not energy efficient (what connects to the cell tower) meaning that heavy networking will consume more battery.Software updates: 7 years of android updates and feature drops garrented. (More than iphone)Price: 900 bucks, not expensive for a device this quality.Do I recommend: If you're ready to put in the price to get a perfect phone that lasts 7 years, then yeah buy it I promise you you will never regret it. Else buy the 8 or 8a but expect worse battery life, camera and slightly worse build quality and 8gb ram instead of 12, but you'll get he same chip so same general performance except the phone will heat slightly more while gaming because of reduced size","78":"**August 10 2022 update**: I have returned my Pixel Buds Pro, so I will not be updating this thread. Some of the reasons for doing so:\\- Transparency mode is a big deal for me. And while they are pretty good on the PBP's, the AirPods Pro still stand unmatched. I rely on this (I guess I'm spoiled on them too) as I wear them almost all the time when out and about, and feel very constricted and not enough sound comes through like on the Airpods. It also has very aggressive wind cancellation, so while walking out and about it will just basically block all sounds out of one ear. Quite often I will toggle the modes just to find out if I am truly in ANC or transparency mode.\\- Price. If I was newly buying them and didn't already have the Airpods, then it would be a no brainer. But for what they are currently, I was hoping for a significant upgrade over the Airpods. I prefer better transparency at the expense of shittier call quality. Also, after switching back to the APP's, I really have enjoyed the sound quality, overall things sound fuller and just... better. Sorry, I'm not a sound engineer so I can't break things down specifically. Paying $294 CAD for these just aren't feasible, and I will be looking out for deals in the future or purchasing second hand if deals come by.\\- Future features. The spatial audio and 5 band EQ sounds nice, but it's not here yet. I've learned my lesson being a Pixel fanboy up until now, that it's better to wait it out and purchase after the features have been released.&#x200B;**FYI** I make updates to this post frequently. I am glad to hear this review has helped so many, and that fueling my the reason to continue updating, especially for those of you that want to know the experience while eagerly waiting for yours to ship! I respond to every question I have an answer for, and I'll get back to all your questions as soon as I can!So I just got my Pixel Buds Pro, and I am quite impressed. I know that a lot of people here are asking about what the difference is from the airpods pro. While I love the Airpods Pro, I have a Pixel phone and it doesn't always play nice, but man the feature of the APP's are amazing enough for me to cross-brand like this, as I'm sure many of you can concur with.&#x200B;Here goes (ratings are relative to experience with Airpods Pro)&#x200B;**ANC** is pretty great. Everything around me is quiet. Standing beside a blender is similar if not better than the APP's. 10\/10**Transparency** mode, on the other hand, still feels a bit muffled. Don't get me wrong, it certainly beats what I had with the WF-1000XM4's, or their canned counterparts. But still nowhere near the APP's. It is easily dealt with though, and will possibly get better over updates, so I'm hopeful. 7\/10&#x200B;**Audio quality**: I'm no audio engineer, so please take this for my own amateur opinion: They are leaning to the trebly side in videos, and makes the sound feel distant. Music sounds quite full though. 7\/10 **\\*\\*\\*EDIT** I have been listening to more videos and when there are high pitched noises, even at low volumes, the high frequency knocks my eardrums out. That is unacceptable. I'm knocking it down to 4\/10 for that. **\\*\\*\\*ANOTHER EDIT**: it seems like the only app that is giving these issues currently is YouTube. I tested this by comparing a music video on YouTube and the same one in the YouTube Music app. They sound completely different. YouTube music sounds well balanced. Sound quality on YouTube music so far is now 9\/10. If you're a YouTube music subscriber, you can test these out for yourself, here are the two links. Disclaimer, it is Pakistani music, but you'll appreciate the difference regardless. [Youtube](https:\/\/youtu.be\/5Eqb_-j3FDA) [YT Music](https:\/\/music.youtube.com\/watch?v=5Eqb_-j3FDA&feature=share)**\\*\\*\\*New Phone call quality**: With the APP's, I've had issues with people not being able to hear me clearly while outdoors. I've also had issues where wind will cut out what the other person is saying. *The following are a few situations I've tested with the Buds and my rating for each. Note that I wait a while to ask the person on the other end about call quality, and they initially have no idea that I am using a new headset, so that I could get an accurate response. I then follow to ask them how the quality is, and then ask them to closely monitor the call following that as well. All these situations are rounded into the ratings I give at the end.*\\- Indoors, quiet environment: As you can imagine, they are 10\/10. People can hear me clearly with no fuss, and I can hear them. 10\/10 (APP's 10\/10)\\- Indoors, in lobby of my building, people walking about and security making their usual calls and such: Again, people can hear clearly, and I can hear them. Zero issues. After asking, they had no idea I was walking about nor around people. Not the case with the Airpods, but at least they didn't hinder the call at all. 10\/10 (APP's 8\/10)\\- Outdoor walking, wind and dogs barking: I couldn't believe the clarity of the calls I had, I could hear people perfectly. Even with wind, people could hear me clearly as well. When I asked about quality, they said they could hear me clearly with no fuss at all Didn't have to repeat a thing, which was quite often the case with the Airpods. 10\/10 (APP's 6\/10)*For the following, it's worth noting I drive a 2008 Hyundai Sonata on all seasons, in Toronto. Hopefully this remotely gives you an idea of road noise, as it is hard to explain.*\\- Driving on highway \\~95km\/hr, windows fully down (worst case): People struggle to hear me clearly. This was expected. The crazy thing is that I can still hear them crystal clear. For what it's worth, I give them an 6\/10 (APP's 2\/10)\\- Driving on highway \\~95km\/hr, windows down to moderate level: People can now hear me, while not perfect, but good enough to carry on a conversation with a few repeated sentences. I couldn't do this with the APP's. 8\/10 (APP's 4\/10)\\- Driving on highway \\~95km\/hr, windows fully up A\/C on: I used to have an issue with the A\/C fan and the Airpods, and people would not be able to hear me great, and I kept hearing them cut out. No longer an issue with the Pixel Buds. I could hear people crystal clear, and after asking, people knew I was driving, but it didn't get in the way of the conversation itself. Never once had to repeat. 10\/10 (APP's 6\/10)&#x200B;**Fit and feel**: I had the comply foam tips on the Airpods, but I would feel comfortable even with the original silicone tips. With the Pixel Buds Pro, not so much. They are miles ahead of the A series however, since those wouldn't even stay in my ear for more than 3 seconds. I will be getting a set of Comply's for the Pixel Buds. Other than this, they fit in my ear quite well and sit flush within the canal. I also love that I can flip the case opened and closed as easily as I could with the APP's case, so yes it's a fidgeter's dream. The open\/close feel is just as solid as the APP's as well. 7\/10&#x200B;**Features:** I love being able to control volume from the swipe controls. That cannot be done with the APP's, and something that I have longed for. I also love the ability to customize if I want to switch between two or three modes (ANC\/Transparency\/everything off). Also, being able to use Google Assistant directly from Buds without hotword is amazing. It would have been nice to have some sort of stem though, since everytime I swipe\/touch I feel a bit of pressure on my ear, and can hear the swipe motion in my drum. 9\/10&#x200B;Got some pictures for you all too: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dybI6dB](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dybI6dB)Let me know if any of you have questions.UPDATES BASED ON YOUR QUESTIONS so you don't have to scroll through the replies (updated once a day)\\- Wireless Charging? Yes! On Gen 1 Pixel Stand? Yes, upside down\\- How flush they are: The are significantly more flush to my ears than the AirPods Pro's\\- How are the magnets inside?

I have a 2018 Cadillac (with their mediocre CUE system), and everything worked great on my P6P.I've found a bunch of different threads where people had issues with P8 or P7 phones, but nothing seems to be working.  I've tried:* Deleting the phone\/car pairing, and re-pair (I've done this after every step)* Reboot both devices (also done after every step)* Delete all other bluetooth devices from both phone and car* Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload* Disable Bluetooth LE audio hardware offload* Disable Bluetooth LE audio* Set Bluetooth AVRCP Version to 1.3* Show Bluetooth devices without namesAfter all of these changes, I'm still seeing the exact same behavior:The car and the phone appear to pair correctly, and the car reports that the phone is connected.  The phone shows \"Connecting\", and then either loops \"Connecting\", or eventually says that something went wrong and to power cycle the other device (car).  On occasion, when I've hit \"forget\" on the car, it mentions something about a pin error (however, I verify every time that the pins match between the phone and the car).Any help?EDIT: After talking with support on 8\/23, they decided that my phone was defective, and sent me a new one.  I received it yesterday, 8\/28, and it behaves identically.  Ran through the same troubleshooting steps, including a new factory reset, and it still doesn't work.My conclusion is that, unfortunately, there's something significantly wrong with the bluetooth chip or software stack for the P9Pxl.  Of the four cars I've tested it with, it only pairs successfully with one.  And neither P9Pxl phone will successfully pair with my Jabra 85t headset.  Again, my P6P works flawlessly with all these devices.At this point, I feel like my only recourse is to send the phones (both original and replacement) back.  But before I do that, I'll reach out to support here, and hopefully they have a better suggestion.","80":"I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my pixel. My phone got stuck immediately after one ring and I was unable to do anything other than click through apps with an emergency phone call running in the background. This is all while the phone informed me that it had sent my location to emergency services. Sadly I couldn't tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again. Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a land line, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over asap. I'll let you know from experience that the last thing you want to go wrong during an actual emergency is your phone to mess up. Especially when time is of the essence, and the faster you get emergency services to your door, the more likely it is that you will survive.I'm hoping that someone from Google can let me know that you're solving for this problem. Cause let's be real, as someone without a landline, I sure as hell don't want a phone that freaks out when I try to call 911 in the middle of a life threatening emergency. I'm supposed to trust that a phone will do the main thing is built for, and place the call, and let me speak to the human on the other end.-----UPDATE-----Tried calling again to see if the bug persists, and it does. I filmed it with my partners phone, and am happy to share. Going on 5 minutes and no response from emergency vehicles and no evidence that 911 was called from a phone log perspective. Checked my Verizon phone log and can see all other calls from today and Friday, but no evidence Verizon knew I was trying to call 911.This is blowing up - wanted to clarify that I had been able get through on other calls the whole time and the 911 call was the only one that hasn't worked or been recorded on either my phone call log or my Verizon call log. I also contacted Google already, but haven't heard back. Also shout-out to whoever pointed me to the FCC as I'm filing the too. Google Support reached out to me through here - Thanks for the upvotes and the visibility \u2764\ufe0f I've sent over a debugging report after replicating the issue. Hopefully their teams can figure out the issue.-----------my response to how Google handled this--------Hey! I wanted to give Google some time after posting their response in this thread and separately on Reddit before posting the below but at this point no one from Google has reached out to me to let me know 1) that there was a bug confirmed and it wasn't just my phone, or 2) how to fix it. Thank goodness Reddit peeps tagged me in things to make sure I was aware that there was a response and a fix for it. You would think with a bug this big Google would have at least responded in our email thread we have going to inform me how to fix it. Actually I would have expected Google to go out of their way and send a push to all Android devices with teams installed to inform their consumers of the possible issue.You know it's amazing how a phone can bring feelings of safety, and how shockingly unsafe one feels when they know their phone is royally effed. The world is a tad bit scary when you're a woman alone walking your dog at night after a day in the hospital. Especially when you're a woman walking their dog alone at night who can hear gun shots a few streets down and is acutely aware of her  inability to call 911 for help. Be it for her own safety or for someone else's. People shouldn't have to wait for this story to make headlines to find out they need to resolve an issue of this magnitude, especially not the person who brought the bug to your attention in the first place. You have the ability to push a notification that informs us our software is out of date, which means you have the ability (and in my opinion the responsibility) to inform us that our life line to emergency services is potentially flawed due to a gap in YOUR software. This issue is bigger than bad press or your bottom line and you should be acting accordingly. I guess I shouldn't presume that the tag line \"do no evil\" means you inherently \"do good\" cause apparently you just don't \"do\" anything at all when it matters. Consider my lesson learnt.----------------------- Other people ------------------------Several other people have messaged me about running into the same issue, including one person today - a few days after Google acknowledged the issue, and a day after Microsoft acknowledged the issue. As this is a known issue actively impacting people after both parties took partial responsibility and both acknowledged the issue, does it make sense to reach out to a lawyer?Phone: Pixel 3OS: Android 11Service: Verizon","81":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.","82":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","83":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market. NOT a member of Google's review free phone group.**Proof I have the phone**https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XrSz0iA**Device Info HW Screenshots**https:\/\/imgur.com\/Rk29cdo**Size** Smaller than Pixel 7, but slightly wide and taller than Pixel 6a. The 6a would still be the best one handed phone below $500 IMHO. Above $500 it would be Galaxy S23 (never had the Zenfone 9 to compare).**Design** Same as Pixel 7, they did make the display flush with the frame like on Pixel 7. If you thought Pixel 7 had sharp edges then Pixel 7a also has them. ~~Plastic frame~~ Metal frame since 6a has metal frame, and plastic back since its not cold to touch on the frame like Pixel 7. Volume rockers and power button have moved down a bit when compared to Pixel 6a. **Hardware** Tensor g2, 8gb ldppr5 samsung ram, goodix finderprint, face unlock on deck, samsung display, stereo speakers. **Weight**6.8oz or 193gthe pixel 7 comes out to 197g on the same scalethe pixel 6a with a screen protector comes to 187g**Display** Same size as Pixel 6a, 90hz confirmed. UI is smooth as Pixel mostly are unless you switching from a 144hz phone and scroll through twitter like crazy in which case you will find it laggy. Colors are good, not S23 quality but good. Bezels are bigger as compared to Pixel 6a. Maybe because of frame wrap around display design.On Pixel 6a, display sits a bit above the frame. Not good for direct sunlight just like Pixel 7 & Pixel 6a. Pixel 6a screen protector will work on Pixel 7a, will be close but will line up.**Battery** 4300mah per device info hw app. 18-20w wired charging per the usb metered cable I have. Wireless charging confirmed. No reverse wireless. **Biometrics**Under display fingerprint scanner (NOT ultrasonic) is as fast or slow as Pixel 7. Does not unlock with unrecognized fingerprint (like it did on Pixel 6a at launch). Face Unlock on deck. **Sound & Haptics**Stereo speakers are decent, and haptics are same as Pixel 6a. Not Pixel 7 or Galaxy S23 class.**Software**Running March 2023 security, and October 2022 Play System. No updates available, might be released on launch day. I dont see spatial audio option, but clear calling is present. **Camera** Gcam version is 8.8.225.What can I say, its a Pixel. Pictures are Pixel quality. Main and wide angle pictures are both 16.1mp. Main is f\/1.9 and wide angle is f\/2.2. front is f\/2.2, 12.2mp pictures. Front camera can do 4k, no option to switch between 30 and 60fps, so am assuming its 4k30 only. I dont see Action mode or cinematic mode as a camera option. Do see long exposure.

I just want to release some steam.Me and my wife have been a Pixel (and Nexus) user from day one. Imported Pixels from other countries, just to be able to use them: USA (Pixel 1 and 5), Germany (Pixel 2XL, 3, 4, 4XL and 6) and next to this the Nexus 5, 5X and 6P (a.k.a. the skateboard or banana). Convincing my family to also go for the A-series of the Pixels and they really like them. They're not power users: 3G connectivity is fine, pictures should be good and battery life of 1 day is fine.Only, since I have replaced my Pixel 5 for an 8 (finally a smaller one!), due to a bad battery, I have been struggling. I know - especially from the Nexus-era - day-one devices aren't always great and you could need a couple of weeks for the software to get bug-free. Not really had this problem with my other Pixels, but that's mainly because I've never bought them new.I'm using the Pixel 8 for almost a month now and I feel like I have paid 675 EUR for a mid-range device with a great camera (that has to be said), but very bad battery performance and connectivity issues. My Pixel 8 will not last a day, even with 2x 45 minutes of wireless charging in my car when commuting. During wireless charging and wireless Android Auto, it gets super hot (even without a case) that my music will stutter. When picking it up to see, it feels very hot as well and it even states a warning about low performances due to the internal temperature.Since a week or so, I have disabled 5G as I have read that 5G drains the battery even faster due to a not-so-optimized modem. It is a bit better now, but only with about 10% in the late afternoon. I don't even use social media: I mainly use my phone to chat via Whatsapp (which I also do mostly via my Macbook), scroll through Reddit (is that social media?) and listen to music, but only in my car. I browse from time to time, but that is mostly it. No games, no movies, no streams.I kinda regret my so-called upgrade as it most definitely doesn't feel like an upgrade. I don't want to use any other Android brand as I believe a company that creates both the hardware and the software should provide the best experience: Apple iPad, Apple Macbook, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel. It is true for most devices in this row and it has been true for the Pixel series as well, up until now. I even kinda feel like I should have gone for the iPhone 15, while I don't even like Apple that much: I mean, it works flawlessly as a laptop to me and my iPad for drawing is also great, but I don't pick up my iPad that much for any other app. I mostly use my phone and I have been a proud Android user forever, since I switched from a Nokia with keyboard to the OnePlus One.**Edit 1:** I don't even have high refresh rate on. Just rocking 60 Hz.**Edit 2:** Small update: I have set back everything to the settings I have had before, being:- 5G enabled- Adaptive connectivity- BT enabled (and NFC\/GPS)- No smooth display (so 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz adaptive)- Dark mode- Previous default dark backgroundI have been using my phone now for about 7 hours and am at 48%. Working from home, so great WiFi connectivity. Nothing really strange here, only in my Batteryusage overview I see:- 19% Maps (SOT: 12 min. \/ Background: 9 min.)- 16% Spotify (Background: 20 min.)- 10% Android Auto (Background: 1 hour 23 min.)Rest is 5% or smaller.I did drive my car today, 2x 10 min. with Wireless Android Autio (yes, I have a USB-C cable laying in my car now, but I wanted to test out the 'original 'situation'). I did not use Maps and I did not use Spotify. Although, both are enabled (Spotify paused) with Android Auto in my overview screen.So, I think Android Auto + the fact that AA uses a lot of these resources as well, take a lot of the battery juice remaining.Next drive I will use wired AA and see what that will give. Most likely, less impact from AA, but still the same impact from Maps and Spotify even when not actively in use.**Edit 3:** I have checked my old Pixel 5 via the ADB commands on this Reddit shared: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gge9cd\/reading_battery_health_statistics_actual_capacity\/ - I find that my Pixel 5 has 665 cycles and 3408 mAh left from the original 4080 mAh. I am thinking of replacing the battery, but do you think this would help? It's a relieve just to hold that phone, so light.A reputable repair company charges 60 EUR for a battery replacement, only they say there is a high chance of breaking the screen, which is on my own risk and costs 299 EUR. I won't be doing this myself and I'm really not looking for another second hand - used - phone from 2020 with the same battery quality.**Edit 4:** I'm at 3 hours 3 min. of SOT, still with the 3 above being the biggest battery drainers. Now on 20%, 17% and 11% respectively. Didn't use AA in the meantime. Got 16% battery left.**Edit 5:** I'm at 3 hours 20 min. of SOT at 1%. Battery saving kicked in at 10%. SOT is 7% of the total of system. My wife has a Pixel 6 and has 5 hours of SOT and 30% remaning. She is using Instagram, Snapchat, etc. socials, Vinted\/Chrome (shopping) and YouTube and such all day.I also see Mobile network has a total of 19 min. but is 56% of the total battery used. This is outrageous!**Edit 6:** Another day another test. I'm ay 51% right now with 51% SOT. I have disabled 5G again as it couldn't find any network, so back on 4G again which at least is stable. Most used app is WhatsApp with 13% battery usage. Mobile network at 39% (been out a lot today). Will result in about 3 to 4 hours of SOT by the end of the day.","85":"# Initial PostVery upset right now, as over a decade of Timeline data has been lost!* Last year (approx. Aug 2024), I followed all of the steps that had been emailed out to complete the conversation to local encrypted storage for timeline data.* My main phone is a Google Pixel 8, running Android 15 and generally the latest updates of all apps.* My Timeline settings were definitely set to \"**Backup: On; Auto-Delete: Never**\" last year, and backups would have been successfully uploading to the cloud backup for months.* Then suddenly on 09\/Mar\/2025, I noticed that my timeline data was mostly empty - losing over a decade of data.* When attempting to \"Restore\" from the cloud backup (*which is dated \"2 days ago\" as of now, so either 07\/Mar\/2025 or 08\/Mar\/2025*), - from any device including totally fresh ones - and **NO** data is returned from before \\~6pm GMT on Friday 07\/Mar\/2025.* This is despite the fact that I **KNOW** for certain that the decade of data \\*used\\* to be included in that backup before. (Because I changed phones late last year in November and everything was transferred over then).* After reading lots of other people's forum posts complaining about the same problem, it now doesn't seem related to specific phones \/ versions, as I've seen it happened to people with Samsungs and different Pixels, using anywhere from Android 12 to 15... (*It definitely just feels like someone at Google accidentally deployed the wrong thing or deleted something from production!*)* Some users report that their high level 'Places', 'Vists' and 'Countries' etc, still show the old totals. Unfortunatly mine have been reduced to patechic post-March 7th figures.Posting here, to see if this is effecting anyone else, and we can align with each other.*Note: My:* [first post on \/r\/google](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/google\/comments\/1j7u1k1\/maps_timeline_backup_has_lost_over_a_decade_of\/)*, and my* [community post on Google forums](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&sjid=10310876563270854239-EU).*Also, note: because there is a sea of Timeline support questions\/articles\/reddit posts\/etc. that are relating to the migration to local storage last year - this is NOT the problem here. I successfully migrated, and that was successful,*. ***Instead this is a sudden loss of previously backed-up data occurred in early March 2025.***\\-------------------------------------------------------------------# SummaryIt appears to me that, something out of our control (*possibly due to a bug in Google Maps app or purely on Google's servers*) caused the Timeline data to be **NOT ONLY**\u00a0deleted all pre-March 7th from **OWN LOCAL DEVICES (!!!)**, but **ALSO** has\u00a0**caused previously-successful \"Cloud Backups\" to over OVERWRITTEN with a backup containing no data from before March 7th...**I know this is the case for me because:1. Doing an import of the current cloud backup to a different new device contains no data from before March 7th.2. And I know for a\u00a0**certainty**\u00a0that that **SAME** cloud backup **USED TO** contain a decade of timeline data, because in November last year I did a factory reset of my device and all the data was loaded successfully after importing.I worry that, regardless of whether or not any potential bug is \"fixed\" in the Maps application going forward - for me and many others it might not make a blind bit of difference - as the data in the backup on Google's servers has gone, and could only possibly be restored by Google themselves in the back-end (*e.g. Internally restore a March 6th backup and enable users like me to be able to \"import\" that data backup*).And as far as I know, it has been **complete radio silence** from Google employees about this....On the Google Maps help community forums, the user '*Vishal Saini*' has been replying to anyone and everyone who posts about this, saying that \"*a bug may have caused this*\" and half-implying that a Google development team \"*may\"* be looking into it (*but I understand that he is not a Google employee and I have no reason to believe he has anymore information than we do...*). This is \\*not at all\\* reassuring because, as explained, I think this issue is going to require manual intervention by Google employees to re-consolidate\/make available each users' last successful backup pre-March 7th...As this is an issue **affecting at least** **~~dozens~~** **of users** who have cared enough to post online about it (*see below for a list*) - meaning that once you include all those who don't bother to post\/haven't noticed yet\/don't care - it's really likely an issue that is **affecting** **~~100s if not~~** **~~1000s~~** **of users**...*(****EDIT: Because within a couple of days, I have found many reddit posts; >50 community forum posts all posted in a single day, often with a couple of others sounding \"me too\" in the comments; and over*** [***620 people marking \"I have the same question\" to this one in 7 days so far***](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/329356095)***(!!!) I'd revise my estimate that the true numbers affected are much more likely to be in 10,000s of total users at the very least...)***Surely, with such a widespread outage, Google would be able to restore those previously-successful, now-deleted, cloud backups that they were were storing successfully up until at least 06th March 2025?!Or is this just unfortunately another lesson that mega corporations like this, can treat users like s\\*\\*t, by not even acknowledging anything happened, and it doesn't make a damn difference...\\-------------------------------------------------------------------# Resolution~~The closest so far is I got~~ [~~this response on the Community forums~~](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&msgid=330063355)~~:~~>*Vishal Saini: \"We have been receiving such reports since March 6\/7, 2025, it may be a transient issue, so you should wait for a few days. Alternatively, to check data availability, please try importing your data, if the backup option was enabled, this is a new option, for that you need to tap on the Cloud button - three dots - Import, if it doesn't work then try importing to a spare phone, if you have a spare phone, if none of the solutions work then you should wait for a few days, if it\u2019s a transient issue, otherwise, the timeline data deleted by the system cannot be recovered.\"*~~That gives a very slight slither of hope that it is a reasonably widespread problem that they are working on resolving and may fix itself in time... But if not, it's pretty shitty behaviour that they have deleted many users data that they explicitly stated was securely \"backed up\"...~~**EDIT: As explained above, I don't think this person works for Google, nor have I seen no evidence that he know anymore than we do -** [**he directly ignored my question about this when asked**](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&msgid=330260816) **- so I don't think listening to his speculation is any help....**The **FIRST** thing I recommend anyone who experiences this tries to do, is to attempt to do a manual backup of the unencrypted data. You can do this via:>`Phone's Settings > Location > Location Services > Timeline > Export timeline data`If this returns a small file, move to the steps below, but if returns a relatively large '.json' file (e.g. >1MB), then you likely have all the data contained in that file. It doesn't necessarily ever make it viewable in the Google Maps app, but at least you'd still have the data yourself... And you could then view it in another tool, such as:\u00a0[https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/](https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*(NB: I'm not verifying the safety of this particular viewer - but it's just an example of multiple that you find when googling, including self-hosted ones).* Unfortunately, for me this is only post-March 7th data.The following steps have apparently worked for people to recover, but unfortunately none have worked for me:1. Go into Timeline, and turn it off and then on again.2. Import from the timeline backups.3. Log in to Google Maps app from a totally fresh device.4. Deleting the Maps app cache (but importantly NOT the data!) 5.

Their support supervisors don't try to connect the dots on data that you give them.  They don't look at attachments.  They will not talk to you on the phone, either.  There's only Level 1 support by phone, due to an awful system Google intentionally has set up.  The Google Fi doesn't have access to the Pixel resources.  In the letter, you'll see there was like 8-10 supervisor responses, and denial reasons were all over the board.There's more to the story than what you see in the letter... This is a summary of \"the final phase\" which turned out to be a cluster of back-and-forth and confusion like the other two phases. Yes, there was a Round 1 and Round 2, which I haven't even gone into.  What you see here is 'Round 3' only.**Solution:** Write a letter to their Investor Relations and tweet u\/MadeByGoogle (I have 0 followers and it still got a response).  In less than 24 hours, I got an email today saying \"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_ and I am a higher level specialist that stumbled upon your case during a routine audit.\"**Letter & More Info are Seen here:** [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA\\_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf\/pub](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQMRYHiEsUVnsITX3alXWTQyA_0dIvzTOfS2ozNNJw1YiNmIFVvltqZfX8FzaTIUx42IuRAA1FRYalf\/pub)The letter is pretty scathing, and I also called them out for something that I am fairly certain is illegal... I'm still debating on showing this to an attorney.**End Result:** I'm never buying a Google phone again.  I'm getting used to a iPhone that was given to me, and I'm likely to stay iPhone at this point.  Once I receive the device, it's getting sold. Feel free to take a few pages out of my book to get the message across... Stand your ground if you know you're right... What a colossal waste of time. **What I would do if I had to do this shit all over again:** \\#1: I wouldn't buy a Google phone at this point, and I still want to hear back from Investor Relations with an authentic answer. I hope one of their reps is reading this thread. #2: If you're out of warranty... I'd start off by doing what it says by \"asking your question to our Twitter account by tweeting '@MadeByGoogle' seen on the [1-year warranty info page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/11833075?hl=en) \\- they're better than any other basic customer support function and \"have a seemingly North American written response\" *if you know what I mean*... - I think either them or Investor Relations is what triggered the 'Customer Service Audit' where a Level 4 up specialist looked into my case, saw all the bullshit, and stepped in. In this thread, you'll hear people talking about their war stories and they mentioned resources like the BBB, the FTC, and maybe a few other channels. #3: I'd have your Date of Purchase, Date of Activation, Date of Issue, Original IEMI number (seen on the box), new IEMI number (if applicable), a picture\/copy of your uBreakIFix receipts (keep ALL of them), and a link to the 1-year warranty page all handy at a moment's notice. You also need to explain to them that changing the motherboard changes the IEMI number, because they don't seem to get that... #4: Don't let them forward you to the ***Fi*** department (I bought from the *Fi store*)... The extended 1-year warranty is in the realm of the ***Pixel*** department. #5 - For you folks who have their phones completely bricked (no charging): The fix is the same as the black screen issue. It'll need a new motherboard. I think it'll be helpful for uBreakIFix to attempt a repair under the black screen warranty. Google can diagnose this as a \"power issue\" but my battery was never replaced and it magically started working again after the motherboard was replaced. Shocker, right? I hope this helps.**EDIT #1:** The only thing I \"won\" was the battle. I'll be \"breaking even\" once I receive my phone. I \"lost\" my patience and a shitload of time, lol.**EDIT #2:** The Radio is NOT under warranty; however, supposedly the radio is integrated into the motherboard (source: uBreakIFix) and when I'm getting a new motherboard, I'm getting a new radio along with it.  The Radio issue only came after the attempted black screen fix.&#x200B;","87":"So I've been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback, and I think it's finally ready to share. This will be mostly an Apple vs. Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones. For context I went from Pixel 4a \u2192 iPhone 13 Pro \u2192 Pixel 5. I used the iPhone for ~5 months before throwing in the towel. These are obviously not all of the differences, but these are the ones that I found most \u201cimpactful\u201d on my personal experience.In order from most impactful to least. Pros:- iOS is just way faster and more reliable. Apps work so much better and faster on iOS, and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts. Memory management is better, apps seem to never ever have to relaunch, Apple does more with less (software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware). It really does seem to \u201cjust work\u201d for the most part. What it does do, it does consistently well, and things behave the way you expect them to. I haven\u2019t encountered a single bug. By far and away the biggest pro. Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole. My Pixel 4a had a number of issues. The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue (presumably) that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call, making it unable to answer, and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call. And the fingerprint sensor did not work. I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again. WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 (just silence), and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether (mobile and WiFi) multiple times\/day until I restarted it, which was also really fun to diagnose...- iMessage: Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones. Android has an equivalent product, but like many of their equivalent products, they have failed to proliferate. Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriers\/OEMs fight over standardization, which means nobody uses any of them. It\u2019s fine, but thanks to Apple, it only works on Apple devices.- Support: if you need help with an issue, unless you pay extra for AppleCare, Apple will direct you to their (mostly useless) online self-help resources, but worst-case scenario you can just walk into an Apple store (assuming you have one nearby) and they won\u2019t  turn you away. When I was looking for a new phone, it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone. When I walked into the Apple store, this is what ultimately sold me. Their reps are super nice and eager to help. Google has \u201cPreferred Care\u201d via uBreakiFix, but it\u2019s really not the same experience and there are no \u201cGoogle Stores\u201d, to my knowledge.- Video: quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip. I don\u2019t think anyone will argue against that. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos, the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesn\u2019t matter.- Ecosystem: If you DO have ALL Apple products, they work together exceptionally well. Android has some stop-gap solutions with Windows but unless you\u2019re using a Chromebook (which comes with its own compromises) there is no powerful and versatile desktop\/laptop solution. There is no good tablet or watch currently. There are options on the horizon but they\u2019ve tried this before and failed.- Connectivity: I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone. The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones.- Battery life: It\u2019s a longboi. Apple\u2019s vertical integration allows for super powerful, but also high efficiency hardware. The battery will easily last me a couple of days.- Haptic Feedback: yes it\u2019s as good as everyone says, it\u2019s almost like a whole language, and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome.- Shortcuts: I didn\u2019t really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature, but not super user-friendly. The fact that there\u2019s a sort of \u201cstore\u201d where you can simply install them is super-cool, and makes them more user-friendly. It\u2019s pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a \u201cShortcut\u201d is run. Android has some similar (but inferior) apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT, but nothing baked into the OS. Google has \u201croutines\u201d via Assistant but they\u2019re incredibly limited in what they can do.- iPhones have 5+ years of software support. The latest Pixels get \"at least\" 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that \"may include feature drops\". Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record. Hold that thought though until we get to the cons.Cons:- Spam handling: As someone who receives about 4-5 annoying spam texts\/calls per day, they just make me miserable. Firstly, and I\u2019m not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app, but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database, so it gives you a sort of quasi-caller-ID (whatever happened to caller ID anyway?). Secondly, the Pixel has the Call Screen feature, and a robust SMS spam filtering service (not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call) that works really well. There are very few things I consider \u201cinvaluable\u201d in a smartphone, but Call Screen is one of them. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined. You don\u2019t even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filtered...or buy an iPhone. iMessage has\u2026almost nothing. You can filter unknown senders\/callers, and you can bring in other 3rd party call\/message filtering apps but they don\u2019t seem to work well, and are typically a paid service. When searching through Apple support, they just direct you to talk to your carrier. Blocking callers is like a 12-step process, and there's not even a way to mark them as junk. This was \u201cthe last straw\u201d for me and why I eventually threw in the towel. I had a particularly bad day for spam. Like 10 calls\/texts in the span of a few hours. Huge #1 con for sure, but that\u2019s just me.- Notification handling and customization: On Android, notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance. Some can be silenced. The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone (if you\u2019re right-handed). Persistent notifications are non-existent, and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about. After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE, OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade. FUCKING WHY!? The swipe gestures are difficult to use. Many times I try to do a horizontal half-swipe or whatever to get to the \u201coptions\u201d menu to change notification settings, but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence. There\u2019s no way to access notification history, like you can very easily and intuitively on Android, so they\u2019re just gone forever. I\u2019ve noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications, as they have a thousand of them, but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized. The notifications on iOS don\u2019t disappear when I read them on another device (specifically Gmail) like they do on Android.- Keyboard: The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple, and something you interact with every time you pick up the device, is nothing short of astonishing. The Apple keyboard has a mind-bendingly stupid button-accessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals. GBoard on Android allows you to add a second long-press layer, add a number row, and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate. Swipe typing on iOS just\u2026doesn't seem to work very well at all. Swipe typing on Android makes one-handed typing very easy. I can even do it without looking. The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it, where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away. SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears, but other times it doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s just very confusing and inconsistent. The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud, almost ear-shattering clack. GBoard has a nice sound, like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper. It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately. 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard.- Anti-right-to-repair stance: Does it really do any good to have 5+ years of software support if they don\u2019t support the hardware? Apple is an industry-leader in preventing repairs of their own devices, and irreparable construction methods. They go to great lengths to ensure this, going so far as to serialize virtually every part, like camera modules, so they won\u2019t work, even if you swap them from one iPhone to another. They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts (sold illegally) from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits. The agreements with Apple\u2019s vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple. That means if you have a broken $5 microchip, you can\u2019t easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device, at a price that is not at all cost-effective, in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one. Although they do provide cost-effective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries.- Custom notification sounds: This is a huge one for me, because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket, and whether or not I need to read\/respond. This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what I\u2019m doing. Not possible on most iOS apps.- No universal back gesture: This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone. It\u2019s very intuitive and natural; if you want to go back, you just swipe from the edge of the screen. iOS doesn\u2019t seem to have any sort of universal \u201cback\u201d function at all. Sometimes, you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right, but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this. Also, even when it does work, swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do right-handed. The Android gesture is ambidextrous.- Desktop messaging: More \u201cwalled garden\u201d problems. In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer. On Android you can use whatever you want, it\u2019s just done through the browser. So I\u2019m forced to type on, and read from, my tiny little phone screen when I\u2019m at home, on that miserable little keyboard, instead of my 49\u201d desktop monitor and full-size physical keyboard.- Text selection: It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly, and for so long. I still don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time. Long-pressing on the screen brings up a magnified view, which is promptly hidden by the finger you\u2019re using to select when moving up. Moving this magnified view up\/down on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue. It could even be tailored to right and left-handed users, but that type of customization is atypical of Apple. You can also long-press on the space bar, but the thing moves so damn fast that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it. It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down\u2026- I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage. I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title. Instead I have to send through the contacts app, which makes it not even worth the effort. I just end up typing in my information, on that miserable little keyboard. I suspect this is another \"walled garden\" thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage, if you opt into it.- Weight: I guess some people equate a heavy phone with \u201cpremium\u201d build quality. I\u2019m of the opposite opinion. Pixel 5 is 151g vs. iPhone 13P 204g (35% lighter!). Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions. Most of this weight savings is derived from the (more durable) aluminum frame construction vs. heavier, more fragile \u201cpremium\u201d glass.- No plugins for Firefox (ad blockers, dark mode, etc). All browsers are modified versions of Safari.- Face ID: Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen, which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android. This is not an issue specifically with Apple\u2019s implementation of Face ID, but just the concept of Face ID in general. If you ask me, FaceID offers no benefits to account for this, and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor. Shortly after that, many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate (it's also just a more convenient location). Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived \u201cprogress\u201d while actually being the opposite, in my opinion.- Default SMS: If, for example, you wanted to use Signal, on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person you're messaging is not using Signal. Not possible on iOS.- Stupid fucking lightning cables: Absolutely no reason for these things to have them, but you have to spend another $100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around, in addition to USB-C cables for other devices, for absolutely no reason.- Aesthetics: Pixels and Google in general just feel very \u201cfun\u201d. Very colorful, and the Pixel UI reflects that, with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default, and \u201cMaterial You\u201d that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at. iOS, on the contrary, is fairly \u201cboring\u201d to look at, and does not change on a regular basis, much less in the last 5? years.- Slow charging (7.5W wireless, 20W wired). Bit of a nitpick here since they\u2019re more efficient and have smaller batteries, but many Android flagships are running 45-200W charging. My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless (with compatible charger, obviously). Not a huge issue either way for me, personally, as I\u2019m never far from a charger for very long.- Siri vs. Google Assistant. Google Assistant is still just so so much better.- Cost: the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was $1k. The Pixel 4a I had previously, which is, in my opinion, superior, was $350.Conclusion: The iPhone works better but the Pixel\/Android does more. I think that\u2019s the most succinct way I can put it.Apple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability, efficiency, ecosystem, and speed but just flops on the easy stuff, which is such a shame. It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000% better. I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality.","88":"Chalk me up as another sucker for Google's trade-in program. I should have known better. I\u2019ve read all the horror stories people have had. I guess I just hoped it had been up and running long enough that the issues would be worked out by now. Plus it just seemed much easier than trying to sell it on my own. Huge mistake.Here are the detailed logs of my interactions with Google over the last six(!) weeks of trying to get this resolved.* **3\/18\/18** \u2013 I purchased a Pixel 2 XL 64GB and initiated a trade-in for my old Pixel XL 32GB. The offer stated that I would receive a refund of **$288.00** to my Synchrony account as long as it powered on, had no cracks in the screen, and had been factory reset. The phone was in mint condition. I had never used it without a case or screen protector and it was literally flawless. Looking back, I should have sold the phone on Swappa. I\u2019m sure I would have gotten a bit more money out of it. I just got caught up in the (supposed) ease of trading it in.* **3\/26\/18** \u2013 I received the trade-in kit and recorded video of me performing a factory reset, powering off the phone, and sealing it in the box. I made sure to show the phone from all angles to make it clear that there was nothing wrong with it. Then I dropped it off at the post office.* **3\/30\/18** \u2013 The phone arrived at its destination in Atlanta.* **4\/6\/18** \u2013 I received a partial refund of **$165.60** with a note claiming \u201cphone doesn\u2019t turn on\/off\u201d. I called in to dispute it, spoke with a rep named Zander who assured me it would be resolved shortly. He asked me to submit my video of the phone working and was told I would be updated within 24-48 hours. I emailed him the video while still on the phone with him and he told me he received it. I was assigned case number: **4-5739000021983**.* **4\/10\/18** \u2013 I emailed Zander back asking for a status update and received no reply.* **4\/13\/18** \u2013 I emailed Zander again, still no reply.* **4\/17\/18** \u2013 I contacted Google via web chat and was told the case was still being investigated and that I should hear back from them soon.* **4\/27\/18** \u2013 I contacted them via web chat again with the same response- it was still being investigated.* **5\/3\/18** \u2013 I called in to check on the status and spoke with a rep named Christy. She said she would personally help me get this resolved and that she would re-escalate the case to an account specialist since no progress had taken place. She said she would stay in contact and that I would hear back in 3-5 days. I was assigned a new case number: **6-9336000022109**.* **5\/7\/18** \u2013 Christy emailed me to say that they were still looking into it and that she would keep me updated.* **5\/12\/18** \u2013 Christy emailed me again to say the same thing, it was still being worked on with no progress.* **5\/18\/18** \u2013 Christy called me and said the investigation had been concluded. She wouldn\u2019t give me any details about it but said the best they could do is give me a **$50** Google Store credit. I told her I didn\u2019t think that was acceptable as I was supposed to receive an additional refund of **$122.40**, not a credit towards a future purchase. At this point I'll never buy something from them again so the credit is worthless. She put me on hold and came back offering me additional **$30** credit. I didn\u2019t accept that as it still wasn\u2019t what I had been promised and I don\u2019t want to settle. I purchased the phone on the premise that I would receive the full **$288.00** as a refund. She then hung up on me!* I called back in and was transferred to the Order Management team. I was placed on hold multiple times for 45 minutes without accomplishing anything. This rep seemed really interested in the fact that I had video evidence of the old phone working and he finally offered to let me speak with a supervisor. He claimed the supervisor wasn\u2019t immediately available though and that he would call me back later that day. I never received a call back.* **5\/21\/18** \u2013 I called in and was transferred to the Order Management Team. I spoke with a rep named Will who said that the case is still open and he promised me he would have a supervisor call me back that day. I told him I just wanted to speak with a supervisor immediately since I didn\u2019t receive a call back last time but he said it wasn\u2019t an option. I reluctantly agreed to wait for a call back. Surprise- I never received a call.I\u2019m appalled at how horrible Google\u2019s customer service is. I\u2019ve bought several devices from them over the past eight years including a Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Galaxy Nexus, all the way back to my Nexus One. I hate to say it but this is will be last purchase I make from them. I\u2019ve been nothing by loyal to them and I\u2019m blown away that they continue to treat their customers like this. It\u2019s clear that they just don\u2019t care. They\u2019re too big and individual customers clearly don\u2019t matter to them.So here I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel like my only option is to turn to the community for help. Maybe posting it here will help bring my issue to light and get it resolved. u\/PixelCommunity are you out there? Anyone from Google Support? I just want you guys to make this right.**UPDATE 5\/22\/18**: Thank you everyone for upvoting this and helping it to gain traction. I never expected this kind of support, but I really appreciate this empathy I've received from this community. It worked! I just received an email from Google Support from a rep named **Jules**. She was extremely apologetic about this situation and has gone ahead to issue the remaining refund. I'm honestly stunned at the moment. It's hard to believe that six long weeks of pushing this have finally paid off. Thank you thank you thank you, to the r\/GooglePixel community and to Jules. You guys have made my day!**UPDATE 5\/23\/18**: I've also been contacted by a Google employee named Jason who has been awesome. He's gone above and beyond to make sure I'm happy and taken care of. Google, if you're listening, **Jules** and **Jason** are fantastic. They deserve all the credit for resolving this and delivering excellent customer service. Please use them as examples for the rest of your teams. They know how to treat customers and deserve to be praised for their efforts. Thanks again!**UPDATE 6\/15\/18:** I never expected to be posting an update like this, but I feel I wouldn't be doing Google justice if I didn't. **Jason** and another employee named **Kyle** put together a care package for me. It was completely unnecessary but incredibly kind of them. They sent me a[ few goodies](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/xcbgaAJ), including a Google Home Mini, a fabric case for my P2XL, and pair of Pixel Buds! I'm at a loss. They completely turned this crummy situation into something fantastic. Thank you guys so much!","89":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.","90":"I just received them, maybe a mistake from Fnac... They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w7x9g1\/pixel_buds_pro_more_info\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Edit : 1 day laterHey there,I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w61knw\/comment\/ihbi45t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.# How did I get them earlier ?I just ordered them on Fnac. The \"Pre order\" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.# What's inside the boxWhen you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.# Design and comfortI thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Best regards redditors,Linkakox","91":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it.","93":"Not since the original Pixel have I been this fully satisfied with a phone. It's definitely not perfect, but it does a REALLY good job of covering so many of my core concerns. I was coming from a Pixel 3 XL, having owned the 2 XL, and 1 non-XL before that, (not to mention Nexi 5x, 6, 5, and 4 prior). My 3 XL, which I know is not universal, had become a deeply laggy mess. In particular it would frequently seize up for 1-3 seconds while doing an input (keyboard, swipe, tapping a button, or pressing volume) and then register it as though I had held down that control that whole time. It otherwise performed relatively well, but was still inconsistent. And battery life was pretty awful overall, with me often at 30% around 1PM (and this was after replacing a bloated battery). And memory management was horrific, with multitasking limited enough that depending on what I was doing, I wouldn't switch out of some apps because I knew I'd lose my place. Additionally 11 made everything worse, made Android Auto perform a lot more slowly, and made it so if I was doing anything too intensive (AA Maps + Podcast, or playing a game) the phone would constantly re-send the latest notification to my Wear OS watch, draining its battery. I was done.The 5 fixes every single one of these issues. It's absurdly fast. I know there were concerns about the processor, and I know most people have dispelled them, but truly, for me, coming from the 3 XL the performance difference is night and day. No lags, fast task switching, fast and reliable interactions, just overall really beautiful. Photo processing is  the only downside here, and I do see it. It's recognizably slower and I do worry about how that'll be long-term. That's the only performance hit.RAM management is an instant game changer (literally), as I can swap out of a game, check email, open a link, do some research, and go back to the game and pick up where I left off. It's exactly what I wanted.Android Auto is SO much quicker and more responsive, consistently. And my watch battery is right now at 81% when driving with it would have driven it to the low 60s or mid-50s. Oh, and bonus: I have a magnetic mount in my car. On my 3 XL I originally used a case with a plate, but after I realized the plate completely screwed up the compass, I found that with a thin clear slightly grippy case, there was enough for the magnet to latch onto in the phone that it could sort of hold the 3 XL on its own. The 5, meanwhile, latches on HARD without a case and holds really solidly. Easy to remove, but doesn't fly off if I hit a heavy bump like the 3 XL. Bonus.Also, totally subjective, but I really like the size. I mainly bought XLs for the battery, and this made that unnecessary. It's way more one-handable and light. Also the surface isn't slippery, and I'm not as terrified of dropping it, so I'm running without a case for now. And the green is very nice. My first non-black phone since the Nexus 6.But the biggest thing of all that changes the entire game is the battery. The absolute lowest I've seen the phone since getting it (accounting for time charging while driving, or leaving it on a wireless charger which isn't optimized for this phone so is only putting out 5W max) is 69% outside of the first evening of over-use. And that's with the same normal use (probably more because it's new and exciting) I put my 3 XL through, including games, text messaging, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, research, OneNote, Excel, etc., etc., etc. This is my work and life phone and I use it a LOT. Today's the first day in YEARS I didn't carry an external battery in my pocket for safety. I seriously don't feel like I need it. It's taking work to get used to, but battery anxiety may be over with this phone. And honestly, this plus the RAM were the two biggest things I wanted from this phone and I got them.It's not without issues. As mentioned, photo processing is slower. The haptics are a step down in quality from previous Pixels. The front speaker might as well just be the bottom-firing one because the left one's pretty junk (hoping for tuning in updates). Phone calls are \\*fine\\*, but definitely not as good, but I rely 80% on Bluetooth so that's not huge for me. Also the bottom speaker placement is annoying FOR ME, because I mostly hold my phone in my left hand, which means it rests on my pinky, and my pinky sits precisely on the speaker and blocks it. Hopefully I can adjust my hold to fix that.So yeah, it has a few small issues that would probably bother me more if it weren't for the life-changing stuff above that really makes me so insanely happier with this phone. This phone is as perfect for ME as I can reasonably want.I know there are a ton of these threads, but I still wanted to share my joy, and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have.EDIT: Also, I live in LA, and use T-Mobile, so I happen to have 5G nearly everywhere I go which I honestly didn't expect. Some places where I had terrible LTE aren't any better. Everywhere else I've ranged as high as 160Mbps down and 98Mbps up, but usually have at least 30\/40. Do I need that? Nah. But it's cool.","94":"[2023 Update] - I have continued to update this post and we are now into 2023 and already seeing reports of Pixel 7s failing to reach 911\/emergency services. It would be really great if we could get some acknowledgement from Google! (u\/PixelCommunity)## OverviewMany of you have probably seen some of the recent posts about Pixels failing to connect to emergency services. I noticed that each one of these posts would also bring replies from other people with the same issue, but many of these commenters never made standalone posts. So, I decided to compile a list of all of the unique reports I could find (for 2022 only) for visibility. In summary:- Below are are 20+ reports of emergency call failures (some links involve multiple failures\/multiple phones) from Pixel users _this year alone_, including from the [past week](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/xwjnf2\/pixel_6_pro_failed_to_connect_to_911_last_week\/).- I've left out the numerous reports from before 2022 in case they were related to the Teams\/alternate dialer bug, which was supposed to have been patched in January.- Not a single word (that I'm aware of) from Google on this. (Google did quickly fix a similar issue affecting a single carrier in Japan, but that is clearly unrelated to this widespread issue).- Very similar versions of this issue have been reported in the US, Spain, and Australia, among other countries.## What about iPhone\/Samsung\/etc.?It's difficult to know for certain as we have to rely on individual reports online or company PR, but:- I haven't been able to find *a single report* (!!) on Reddit or elsewhere of an iPhone or another major Android brand having this issue within the last few years. (If you can find any such reports, please let me know and I will update this post!).    - So far commenters have pointed out a handful links to iPhone failures: one in 2018, one in 2014, and one in 2008. Still looking for more recent\/widespread reports.- Apple and Samsung both sell *10-20x* the number of phones Google does ([source](https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/google-nearly-quadruples-market-share-3-percent\/)), so it is _very_ surprising that Pixel emergency failure reports are so numerous and easy to find while there don't seem to be *any* for these other phones.- One notable feature of many of the reports below is that people were able to dial 911 with their work phones\/partner's other brand phones\/other bystanders' phones, which to me suggests that these issues weren't caused by local 911 outages.## The List - Pixel Emergency Failure Reports in 2022So, here are the reports I've been able to find for Pixels in 2022 in one afternoon of digging:1.

I am a die-hard Pixel fan and love everything about the experience (I even have a 7, 7 Pro, and 2 watches on preorder - too late to cancel now so I'll have to return), but I just don't feel okay gambling my life (or my partner's) with this issue.I've been happy to see that in the past few days some tech news sites ([PhoneArena](https:\/\/www.phonearena.com\/news\/pixel-911-emergency-calls-bug_id143002) and [AndroidPolice](https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/google-pixel-phones-struggling-to-reach-emergency\/)) have posted articles about this issue, but I haven't yet seen another exhaustive compilation, and of course, still no word from Google on this.[Edit] - I (foolishly) stuck with Pixels and we've been happily using our 7\/7 Pro and Pixel Watches, but now reports have started to roll in of Pixel 7s having the same emergency calling issues... here we go again! (Or maybe I shouldn't say again because the 6 continues to have this issue).**If you know of another report or if this has happened to you please comment and I will add to the list.**--## EDIT: FAQsI've noticed some common questions\/comments come up in the replies, many of which are addressed in the linked posts (or comments by the original posters). To save people from having to read through all of the accounts\/dig through comment history, I'm going to compile some of these here.1. **Could these be people who never updated after the 911 bug Google fixed in January?**    - It's possible that a few of the earlier reports in this list are caused by that, but some of the later reports [specifically verified](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/xwjnf2\/comment\/ir9v1di\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that their software was up to date.     - I specifically excluded any reports from early January 2022 or before to reduce the likelihood that that bug was involved.2. **Could these reports just be due to being in areas with poor signal?**    - Many of the reports (see the 1st and 3rd for examples) mention other facts that preclude this possibility:         - Successfully making regular calls in the same place right before\/after        - Family members on the same plan successfully dialing 911 from the same location        - Their phones showing full signal3. **Could this be related to 2G\/3G phaseout?**    - I am not knowledgeable about this, but I have a few thoughts. First, the issue has happened in multiple countries, which does make me think this is unlikely. Second, even if it were related, why hasn't this affected other phones? If this were the case, it doesn't excuse Google as clearly other manufacturers had no problems4. **What about the iPhone rollercoaster 911 calls?**    - The major difference there is that this represents a phone unintentionally contacting emergency services, rather than being unable to in the midst of an emergency.5. **Is this a carrier-specific issue?**    - Right off the bat the existence of this issue in multiple countries\/continents suggests that this is not the case. However, even within the US reports there are multiple carriers mentioned: definitely **Fi** and **Verizon**, possibly others.6. **Isn't this just anecdotal?**    - Yes, so of course we don't know the full extent of the issue, but if we apply some **basic reasoning** we notice a few important features of this issue:        - There are numerous anecdotes of Pixels specifically failing _in 2022_        - There are (currently) _zero_ anecdotes of iPhones or Samsungs failing in the past 4 years (let alone in 2022)        - iPhones and Samsungs both sell **10-20 times** the numbers that Pixels do        - Even if you assumed that every member of r\/GooglePixel was a current Pixel owner (~890k members), this represents only 2-5% of Pixel owners in the wild. Even if having a 911 issue might make a user _more likely_ to join Reddit and post here, it is very unlikely that _all_ or even _most_ people who experience such an issue would happen to come to Reddit or post on support.google.com.        - The OP of the 1st report has a video on her instagram of her reproducing the issue reliably _days later_ from her home.    - While these facts don't _prove_ anything, by _far_ the simplest possible explanation is that:        - There is an issue specifically with Pixels        - Statistically, it is likely that only a small percentage of people with the issue have reported it in a public forum, meaning that it is overwhelmingly likely that this issue affects more people than have reported it here.--Edit: thank you anonymous stranger for the award!","95":"I haven't seen one of these posted yet so I figured I'd create one:# The Verge ( [Google Pixel Buds Pro review: the sweet sound of redemption - The Verge](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/23281445\/google-pixel-buds-pro-noise-canceling-earbuds-review) )*Score: 8\/10.*Good Stuff* Good active noise cancellation* Improved sound and lengthy battery life* Multipoint support* No more frequent audio dropoutsBad Stuff* Transparency mode isn\u2019t as good as it could be* No support for advanced Bluetooth codecs* Audio fidelity falls short of the very best earbuds* Mic quality could still use some work# Ars Technica ( [Earbud review: Google Pixel Buds Pro fall well short of their $200 price | Ars Technica](https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2022\/07\/earbud-review-google-pixel-buds-pro-fall-well-short-of-their-200-price\/) )Verdict: Google Pixel Buds Pro don't skimp on advertised new features, but Google's $100 Pixel Buds A undercut this newer model in serious ways.

","96":"Pixel 6 boy here.Android pushed the Android 15 OS update the other day and ever since my Bluetooth is very unstable when connecting to the car, but for audio (music) only.The telephone function still works as expected, although I will note there are extra notes and tones when a call ends, and reminds me as though the phone was plugged in via aux as opposed to Bluetooth, however my buttons on the steering wheel still control the hang up and answer call function.The biggest problem is the audio connection. I have to go into Bluetooth settings, select my device, and repeatedly disconnect and reconnect until it finally settles on a connection it's happy with.I was googling and followed the suggestion to forget my car from the device list and then try to re-pair, unfortunately now it won't pair with the car. I'm not ruling out the chances that it's a problem with the OEM radio in the car, but that is the constant, and the phone is the device that has changed and I have only experienced this since the update.Has anyone else with a Pixel 6 had the same issue? How can you report the bug back to Google? I commute a lot and can't be without the car connection. I feel really quite let down by the oversight. ","97":"*(Edit: Full review added to the post instead of linking off)*After reading a lot of questions and feedback in here about various aspects of the [Pixel Buds 2](https:\/\/nickdenardis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/google-pixel-buds-2.jpg) I decided to write up what my first 48 hours have been like with them.I have no comparison to other wireless earbuds but work at a computer all day on calls, record podcasts, and an avid runner.This is my take as an average new user and address my experience with some of the things others have been mentioning, hissing, connection, mic quality, connection to a Macbook, etc.\\-----## AppealWireless headphones have never been my thing. I\u2019ve had numerous wired headphones though, from the [Apple in-ear](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ie-business\/shop\/product\/ME186ZM\/B\/apple-in-ear-headphones-with-remote-and-mic) to [Sony in-ear](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-MDRXB50AP-Extra-Earbud-Headset\/dp\/B00JRD13T8) to the [Pixel USB-C earbuds](https:\/\/store.google.com\/us\/product\/usb_c_earbuds). For me, it\u2019s all about how secure they are in my ear while on a long run.The appeal of the Pixel Buds came from using assistant with the USB-C earbuds, it\u2019s just so convenient. For context, I\u2019ve never tried the original Pixel Buds or any other wireless headphones.## FitDecided on the smallest pads. The medium size seemed fine, but after having them in for more than an hour at a time, I found the smallest ones were the best mix of fit and ability to hear talking when audio is paused.They are seriously light though, it hardly feels like there is anything in your ears.## Audio volumeAt first, they felt pretty quiet, but after some adjusting, they seem only slightly on the quiet side. There is definitely something odd about the volume controls though. At times it felt like there were two volume controls while connected to a Mac. The output volume works like normal, but then there seems to be a separate Buds volume that is controlled through swiping. Sometimes they update in sequence, but with the Mac volume all the way up, I can still turn up the Buds by swiping until they top out. Not ideal, and probably a bug, but it may be why some people feel they are quieter than they should be.## Swiping and touch controlsThese feel completely natural and work really well. On two occasions though while running and trying to turn the volume up it thought I long-pressed and read me the time and all my notifications. This could have been due to sweat, but it was unexpected.## Battery lifeTo be honest these (or any in-ear headphones) are not something I would want to wear all day long. I am on calls for 3-4 hours per workday, but I haven\u2019t yet had the chance to see how long I would keep them in.Spend the second day doing a ton of yard work and had them in \\~40% of the day. Feels natural to put them back into their case when not in my ears and the longest amount of time wearing them only reduced the battery to 40%.They come fully charged out of the box and after 48 hours the case is still at 38%. Even if I traveled a lot and wasn\u2019t able to get to a charger each night, the amount of battery seems on par for what is reasonable and I likely wouldn\u2019t spend more for a higher capacity battery.## Adaptive soundSo far so good on this front. It is nice to hear conversations around me without have to take the Buds out. While running next to a loud road the sound did turn up automatically and then back down when it got quieter. While mowing the lawn it did the same. I would say the feature is pretty helpful but found myself still adjusting the volume between podcasts and wish the adaptive sound would equalize the output audio instead of assuming all audio is already equalized.## MicrophoneI\u2019m used to recording audio on my computer with a podcasting mic. This one was a bit weird for me to wrap my head around. While connected to the Pixel 3 XL and making a call outside in a windy environment the person I was talking to said I sounded normal and they couldn\u2019t hear any wind at all, which was great.I make a lot of calls from my computer though, a 2017 Macbook Pro 13\u2033 with Touch Bar. This is where things get complicated. I tried to record the mic and got some really horrible results similar to [Tech FireSide](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcqkhyYvpa8). But realized it was only because Mac OS was doing some sort of downsampling only while recording, the actual call quality was really good.After listening to someone else talk on them from the Mac or phone I can say the mic really is high quality and on-par with a wired microphone.A real world test after a full work day will be telling though.## Connection qualityConnected to the Pixel 3 XL the connection has been great, I was able to walk a good \\~30 feet away inside and \\~100 feet outside with no regression in the audio quality. Connected to the Mac though I was surprised the range was only about 15 feet at best. Apparently the 2017 Macbook Pro only has Bluetooth 4.2, which severely limits the range.When moving from the Pixel to the Mac and back and forth multiple time the speed was fantastic. Only two or so seconds to disconnect and reconnect.Some people have reported one or both Buds cutting out with head or body movement. I\u2019ve run multiple miles with my phone in a [SPIbelt](https:\/\/spibelt.com\/) and cut the lawn with my phone in the pocket with no cutting out from either earbud.## Google AssistantSomething I\u2019ve struggled with is going truly voice-based for all interactions. With the USB-C pixel earbuds, I was able to hear all notifications and they were read to me. I could prompt this by holding the mic button and it would read the time and then all unread messages.Without the cord and with my hands dirty I\u2019m looking for a way to do the same but with only my voice. I\u2019ve tried the recommended \u201cread my messages\u201d with mixed results. I have checked my app notification settings and all the relevant ones are on.I still haven\u2019t found a consistent voice command to have Google read me all my unread notifications without touching the physical buds.## Firmware updateIt took a few times of taking the Buds in and out of their case and then leaving them alone for them to update then report their new version. There was no audible sound or notification to let me know they were being updated or that the update was complete.## HissingI have not experienced hissing when connected to the Pixel 3XL, even when listening to audio at the lowest volume. As soon as they are paired with the Macbook Pro though there is a noticeable hiss when in-between apps\/music but it seems to silence itself after a second or two. Definitely not noticeable or a dealbreaker and feels like it is coming from the computer instead of the Buds.## OverallThe first two days have been wonderful. I don\u2019t have a lot of context to other wireless headphones but compared to the wired ones I\u2019m used to the Pixel Buds are great. I\u2019ve found myself leaving them in my ears more than their wired counterparts.I mostly listen to books and podcasts but the overall sound quality is great although if I really wanted to listen to rich music I would opt for over the ear headphones any day.For me, the largest sell is the ability to access the Assistant and everything on my phone with voice.\\-----Hope this helps someone!","98":"So I just picked up the pixel buds 2 and have been highly anticipating them throughout the spring. I've never had \"nice\" Bluetooth earbuds, just a couple pairs of the cheap ones on Amazon. I do, however, heavily use and love my Sony ~~XM3s~~ WH1000XM3's for music, phone calls and PS4. I picked up the pixel buds looking for that seamless integration with my Pixel 4XL. So after my first work-from-home day, here are my impressions.I got what I wanted, seamless integration with the pixel 4XL. Setup was quick and easy. The buds pair almost instantly when you open the case. You get a nice overview of battery level for each individual earbud and for the case itself in the settings menu.Speaking of battery, I've found that the earbud battery life is about accurate to what Google says. At 5hrs of music playback and 3 hrs of talk time, it doesn't compete with other earbuds in the price range.However, this hasn't been an issue for me so far because when I've been on phone calls today, I've just been using one earbud at a time. I absolutely love this feature and it seems to work very well. Want to use just one earbud? Take one out of the case and stick it in your ear. The phone recognizes which one you're using and which one is charging in the case. I took my first hour-long call this morning with the left earbud and drained it down to 66% battery, then swapped for the second consecutive hour call in matter of like 3 sec. I think I'll be doing this for most of my use cases, even when traveling, but if you're someone that needs both earbuds for long phone call sessions (over 3 hrs at a time) I wouldn't recommend these.Sound is much different than my Sony's but I love it. You can easily hear the outside world, and there is crisp, clear music kind of just happening in your ears. It's much different than the ANC XM3s. You're kind of in your own isolated world with those headphones - it sounds that way and certainly feels that way as well. I imagine I'll be using the Sony's and pixel buds in different scenarios from now on. If I'm just listening to music at my desk, or on a plane, I'll be using the Sony's. If I'm exercising, taking calls, or working in the lab while on a call, I'll be using the pixels. In fact I think I'll be taking most of my calls with the pixel buds from now on.Comfort: for my ears, these are very comfortable. They don't form a seal like other earbuds, but the little rubber spine fits perfectly- I don't think I could shake them out if I tried. I do have a cheap pair of ~~Aukey~~ Taotronics Airpod knock offs, and when I'm on a call with those, I purposely have to loosen them from my ear a bit, because it's hard to talk with a perfect seal on your ear. Anyways, the pixel buds are pretty comfortable for me for the first hour or two of wearing. After that, I felt like I wanted to take them out and let my ears breathe. However, my wife tried them and they absolutely do not work for her ears. The little rubber spine just does not have a place to rest for her ears. That being said, she knows she has weird ears and has a lot of trouble finding earbuds that work for her in general. She primarily uses the Bose 700's.Later in the afternoon, I gave a test call to my wife from the car, and results were great. Used the Google assistant via the headphones to place the call, and that worked immediately, just like using it from my phone. At first I had just the right earbud in, and my wife said the audio was clear and she couldn't hear any of the background noise from inside the car. She couldn't tell I was actually calling from the car. I popped the other earbud in, and she said the audio got a bit louder, but still just as clear. Then I rolled down the windows expecting the mics to pick up the wind whipping around in the car, but nothing. Seems like whatever tricks Google came up with to cut out background noise really works, and call quality is great.Overall, I'm loving the new pixel buds. I've seen some reviews mention that they're a bit overpriced, especially compared to the Samsung buds. I haven't tried those so I'm not in a position to compare value, but I will say that I don't feel like I paid too much. I'm very happy with the features, build quality and sound quality, enough so to write up a review on them.TL;DR. Good sound, good comfort, great call quality, great build quality, great features, seamless integration with my Pixel, meh battery life. I'm a happy customer on the whole.Edit: I actually have the Taotronics (not Aukey) Airpods knock-offs. Did a little layman's sound comparison with them, my WH1000XM3s and the Buds2 in one of the comments below.Edit2: I have the over-the-ear WH1000XM3's, not the WF1000XM3 buds. I knew about Sony's buds, but didn't know they're also named the XM3's.","99":"The last Google phone I had was the Nexus 6P at launch, [remember when phones came is cool packaging and included everything](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/McZQBtO.jpeg)? Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https:\/\/imgur.com\/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons\/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my \"Google\" folder is [even bigger](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify\/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+\/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a \u00a31400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light.","100":"What the hell are you doing, Google?After updating(Pixel 4), I have noticed a couple of really bad design elements, disallowing the person to choose what's best for them and then - plain worsening of the usability aspects.\"Pixel that adapts to you\" my ass. Changing accent colors based on wallpaper is marketed as advanced adapting? Taking away the user's options is the worst thing that Google could do to their customers - people who enjoy customization & advanced users who use Android devices for a reason.Here is a list of some of the \"this is dumb\" experiences I have found from my usage, and from others as well1. Lock screen clock. It's huge, it's not adjustable in any way and it looks ugly (this, of course, depends on the person, but not having the ability to change it is pretty wild) [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/V51VthNj\/a3650fda](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/V51VthNj\/a3650fda)2. Clock widget on the home screen. What is up with the ugly ass background, why can't we have an option to enjoy the wallpaper that we as users CHOOSE to set. Wasn't this what the marketing was all about? Phone adjusting to ME? This is just purely idiotic decision - why wouldn't you leave the old widgets as well, why do you have to push such shitty UI elements onto people? [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/ZBY6b6Ty](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/ZBY6b6Ty)   edit: this seems to be a bug. some people(including me) are not seeing the option to remove the background, some are.   3. Can't click on the date in the \"At a glance\" widget to open Calendar. (From comments) You can't click on the clock in the notification shade as well anymore.4. The bubbly\/stretchy animation - it's smooth, but it's not really nice seeing my whole screen bouncing around when I get to the bottom or top of something. This is especially noticeable in The App Drawer. This now feels like a kid's toy, not a device that power users could use.5. Quick toggles - I for one don't mind the new design, but the fact that you can't change how round the borders are and how much space there is in the toggles themselves - that's just wasted space. On a similar note - it's impossible to flick-swipe the toggles away now. You have to swipe up 2 times, instead of 1 flick, to return to the app you were using. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hjqj3bf4](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hjqj3bf4)6. What's a lot worse - is the fact that, for some reason, Google decided that transparent backgrounds are the enemy of state and forced solid background in both - app drawer and app switcher (and probably elsewhere). What makes it worse though, is how bad it's done. If you go in an app, press and pull the app switcher up (without releasing), the background is your wallpaper. Only after you release - the background becomes solid. (From comments) This also happens for the notification shade, even if you don't have any notifications... WHAT PROBLEM DOES THIS SOLVE OTHER THAN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY MY WALLPAPER? [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zK9pBGx](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zK9pBGx)7. Continuing with the idiotic design elements - The App Drawer. It doesn't look half bad, until you start scrolling. Suddenly a big gray rectangle appears at the top. For some reason the search bar is sticky, with an ugly solid background, and, of course, there's no way to change it. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zv5qW83](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/zv5qW83)8. The \"styling\" of the Google Launcher. You can't change the style of little icons anymore, you can't change the style of big icons, you can't change the fonts, you can't change the accent colors to anything else than the bland 4 colors that are provided by Google. You basically can't do anything customization-wise, that you could on Android 11.[https:\/\/postimg.cc\/94ZXzfmP](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/94ZXzfmP)9. And now to the worst offender - the notifications. Grouping is different (worse), each notification in the shade takes up a lot more space - not because there's more information, but because of the rounded corners and added spacing in each notification. One message takes up half the screen, basically. [https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hc3g7cfM](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/Hc3g7cfM)10. (From comments) Everything looks monotonous.11. (From comments) At a glance widget taking up the whole width of the screen for some reason.12. (From comments) Font size feels too big. If you go into settings and change it - then it's too small. There's a noticeable \"gap\" between the settings now, where you can't get the font to be \"just right\".Don't get me wrong - the update is probably a good thing, but the \"minor\" things that Google has left in there - that look plain ugly, that worsens the experience, that ruins the look of the device completely is too much to handle.In addition - I'm usually very open minded to visual changes and different experiences, but this update, especially from UI\/UX perspective just feels cheap. It feels like I traded in my smartphone for a toy.I would like for someone at Google to read this, but they probably won't, and probably wouldn't care anyways. For the first time since owning the device I'm feeling like I will have to go with custom rom to be able to adjust MY experience with the device.Google has released first hardware upgrade for their cameras in years - that could welcome a lot of new users. The new Tensor chip sounds awesome as well. The price is very aggressively set.But every single thing of that won't matter, if the software experience feels cheap and looks like crap.Rant over, cheers.&#x200B;edit: adding some points from comments as well","101":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","102":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market.

The 6a would still be the best one handed phone below $500 IMHO. Above $500 it would be Galaxy S23 (never had the Zenfone 9 to compare).**Design** Same as Pixel 7, they did make the display flush with the frame like on Pixel 7. If you thought Pixel 7 had sharp edges then Pixel 7a also has them. ~~Plastic frame~~ Metal frame since 6a has metal frame, and plastic back since its not cold to touch on the frame like Pixel 7.

UI is smooth as Pixel mostly are unless you switching from a 144hz phone and scroll through twitter like crazy in which case you will find it laggy. Colors are good, not S23 quality but good. Bezels are bigger as compared to Pixel 6a. Maybe because of frame wrap around display design.On Pixel 6a, display sits a bit above the frame. Not good for direct sunlight just like Pixel 7 & Pixel 6a.

They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w7x9g1\/pixel_buds_pro_more_info\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Edit : 1 day laterHey there,I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w61knw\/comment\/ihbi45t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.# How did I get them earlier ?I just ordered them on Fnac. The \"Pre order\" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.# What's inside the boxWhen you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.# Design and comfortI thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now !

They're not power users: 3G connectivity is fine, pictures should be good and battery life of 1 day is fine.Only, since I have replaced my Pixel 5 for an 8 (finally a smaller one!), due to a bad battery, I have been struggling. I know - especially from the Nexus-era - day-one devices aren't always great and you could need a couple of weeks for the software to get bug-free. Not really had this problem with my other Pixels, but that's mainly because I've never bought them new.I'm using the Pixel 8 for almost a month now and I feel like I have paid 675 EUR for a mid-range device with a great camera (that has to be said), but very bad battery performance and connectivity issues. My Pixel 8 will not last a day, even with 2x 45 minutes of wireless charging in my car when commuting. During wireless charging and wireless Android Auto, it gets super hot (even without a case) that my music will stutter. When picking it up to see, it feels very hot as well and it even states a warning about low performances due to the internal temperature.Since a week or so, I have disabled 5G as I have read that 5G drains the battery even faster due to a not-so-optimized modem. It is a bit better now, but only with about 10% in the late afternoon. I don't even use social media: I mainly use my phone to chat via Whatsapp (which I also do mostly via my Macbook), scroll through Reddit (is that social media?) and listen to music, but only in my car. I browse from time to time, but that is mostly it. No games, no movies, no streams.I kinda regret my so-called upgrade as it most definitely doesn't feel like an upgrade. I don't want to use any other Android brand as I believe a company that creates both the hardware and the software should provide the best experience: Apple iPad, Apple Macbook, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel. It is true for most devices in this row and it has been true for the Pixel series as well, up until now. I even kinda feel like I should have gone for the iPhone 15, while I don't even like Apple that much: I mean, it works flawlessly as a laptop to me and my iPad for drawing is also great, but I don't pick up my iPad that much for any other app. I mostly use my phone and I have been a proud Android user forever, since I switched from a Nokia with keyboard to the OnePlus One.**Edit 1:** I don't even have high refresh rate on. Just rocking 60 Hz.**Edit 2:** Small update: I have set back everything to the settings I have had before, being:- 5G enabled- Adaptive connectivity- BT enabled (and NFC\/GPS)- No smooth display (so 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz adaptive)- Dark mode- Previous default dark backgroundI have been using my phone now for about 7 hours and am at 48%. Working from home, so great WiFi connectivity. Nothing really strange here, only in my Batteryusage overview I see:- 19% Maps (SOT: 12 min. \/ Background: 9 min.)- 16% Spotify (Background: 20 min.)- 10% Android Auto (Background: 1 hour 23 min.)Rest is 5% or smaller.I did drive my car today, 2x 10 min. with Wireless Android Autio (yes, I have a USB-C cable laying in my car now, but I wanted to test out the 'original 'situation'). I did not use Maps and I did not use Spotify. Although, both are enabled (Spotify paused) with Android Auto in my overview screen.So, I think Android Auto + the fact that AA uses a lot of these resources as well, take a lot of the battery juice remaining.Next drive I will use wired AA and see what that will give. Most likely, less impact from AA, but still the same impact from Maps and Spotify even when not actively in use.**Edit 3:** I have checked my old Pixel 5 via the ADB commands on this Reddit shared: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gge9cd\/reading_battery_health_statistics_actual_capacity\/ - I find that my Pixel 5 has 665 cycles and 3408 mAh left from the original 4080 mAh. I am thinking of replacing the battery, but do you think this would help? It's a relieve just to hold that phone, so light.A reputable repair company charges 60 EUR for a battery replacement, only they say there is a high chance of breaking the screen, which is on my own risk and costs 299 EUR. I won't be doing this myself and I'm really not looking for another second hand - used - phone from 2020 with the same battery quality.**Edit 4:** I'm at 3 hours 3 min. of SOT, still with the 3 above being the biggest battery drainers. Now on 20%, 17% and 11% respectively. Didn't use AA in the meantime. Got 16% battery left.**Edit 5:** I'm at 3 hours 20 min. of SOT at 1%. Battery saving kicked in at 10%. SOT is 7% of the total of system. My wife has a Pixel 6 and has 5 hours of SOT and 30% remaning. She is using Instagram, Snapchat, etc. socials, Vinted\/Chrome (shopping) and YouTube and such all day.I also see Mobile network has a total of 19 min. but is 56% of the total battery used. This is outrageous!**Edit 6:** Another day another test. I'm ay 51% right now with 51% SOT. I have disabled 5G again as it couldn't find any network, so back on 4G again which at least is stable. Most used app is WhatsApp with 13% battery usage. Mobile network at 39% (been out a lot today). Will result in about 3 to 4 hours of SOT by the end of the day.","105":"So I've been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback, and I think it's finally ready to share. This will be mostly an Apple vs. Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones. For context I went from Pixel 4a \u2192 iPhone 13 Pro \u2192 Pixel 5. I used the iPhone for ~5 months before throwing in the towel. These are obviously not all of the differences, but these are the ones that I found most \u201cimpactful\u201d on my personal experience.In order from most impactful to least. Pros:- iOS is just way faster and more reliable. Apps work so much better and faster on iOS, and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts. Memory management is better, apps seem to never ever have to relaunch, Apple does more with less (software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware). It really does seem to \u201cjust work\u201d for the most part. What it does do, it does consistently well, and things behave the way you expect them to. I haven\u2019t encountered a single bug. By far and away the biggest pro. Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole. My Pixel 4a had a number of issues. The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue (presumably) that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call, making it unable to answer, and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call. And the fingerprint sensor did not work. I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again. WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 (just silence), and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether (mobile and WiFi) multiple times\/day until I restarted it, which was also really fun to diagnose...- iMessage: Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones. Android has an equivalent product, but like many of their equivalent products, they have failed to proliferate. Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriers\/OEMs fight over standardization, which means nobody uses any of them. It\u2019s fine, but thanks to Apple, it only works on Apple devices.- Support: if you need help with an issue, unless you pay extra for AppleCare, Apple will direct you to their (mostly useless) online self-help resources, but worst-case scenario you can just walk into an Apple store (assuming you have one nearby) and they won\u2019t  turn you away. When I was looking for a new phone, it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone. When I walked into the Apple store, this is what ultimately sold me. Their reps are super nice and eager to help. Google has \u201cPreferred Care\u201d via uBreakiFix, but it\u2019s really not the same experience and there are no \u201cGoogle Stores\u201d, to my knowledge.- Video: quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip. I don\u2019t think anyone will argue against that. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos, the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesn\u2019t matter.- Ecosystem: If you DO have ALL Apple products, they work together exceptionally well. Android has some stop-gap solutions with Windows but unless you\u2019re using a Chromebook (which comes with its own compromises) there is no powerful and versatile desktop\/laptop solution. There is no good tablet or watch currently. There are options on the horizon but they\u2019ve tried this before and failed.- Connectivity: I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone. The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones.- Battery life: It\u2019s a longboi. Apple\u2019s vertical integration allows for super powerful, but also high efficiency hardware. The battery will easily last me a couple of days.- Haptic Feedback: yes it\u2019s as good as everyone says, it\u2019s almost like a whole language, and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome.- Shortcuts: I didn\u2019t really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature, but not super user-friendly. The fact that there\u2019s a sort of \u201cstore\u201d where you can simply install them is super-cool, and makes them more user-friendly. It\u2019s pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a \u201cShortcut\u201d is run. Android has some similar (but inferior) apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT, but nothing baked into the OS. Google has \u201croutines\u201d via Assistant but they\u2019re incredibly limited in what they can do.- iPhones have 5+ years of software support. The latest Pixels get \"at least\" 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that \"may include feature drops\". Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record. Hold that thought though until we get to the cons.Cons:- Spam handling: As someone who receives about 4-5 annoying spam texts\/calls per day, they just make me miserable. Firstly, and I\u2019m not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app, but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database, so it gives you a sort of quasi-caller-ID (whatever happened to caller ID anyway?). Secondly, the Pixel has the Call Screen feature, and a robust SMS spam filtering service (not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call) that works really well. There are very few things I consider \u201cinvaluable\u201d in a smartphone, but Call Screen is one of them. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined. You don\u2019t even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filtered...or buy an iPhone. iMessage has\u2026almost nothing. You can filter unknown senders\/callers, and you can bring in other 3rd party call\/message filtering apps but they don\u2019t seem to work well, and are typically a paid service. When searching through Apple support, they just direct you to talk to your carrier. Blocking callers is like a 12-step process, and there's not even a way to mark them as junk. This was \u201cthe last straw\u201d for me and why I eventually threw in the towel. I had a particularly bad day for spam. Like 10 calls\/texts in the span of a few hours. Huge #1 con for sure, but that\u2019s just me.- Notification handling and customization: On Android, notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance. Some can be silenced. The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone (if you\u2019re right-handed). Persistent notifications are non-existent, and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about. After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE, OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade. FUCKING WHY!? The swipe gestures are difficult to use. Many times I try to do a horizontal half-swipe or whatever to get to the \u201coptions\u201d menu to change notification settings, but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence. There\u2019s no way to access notification history, like you can very easily and intuitively on Android, so they\u2019re just gone forever. I\u2019ve noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications, as they have a thousand of them, but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized. The notifications on iOS don\u2019t disappear when I read them on another device (specifically Gmail) like they do on Android.- Keyboard: The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple, and something you interact with every time you pick up the device, is nothing short of astonishing. The Apple keyboard has a mind-bendingly stupid button-accessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals. GBoard on Android allows you to add a second long-press layer, add a number row, and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate. Swipe typing on iOS just\u2026doesn't seem to work very well at all. Swipe typing on Android makes one-handed typing very easy. I can even do it without looking. The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it, where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away. SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears, but other times it doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s just very confusing and inconsistent. The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud, almost ear-shattering clack. GBoard has a nice sound, like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper. It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately. 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard.- Anti-right-to-repair stance: Does it really do any good to have 5+ years of software support if they don\u2019t support the hardware? Apple is an industry-leader in preventing repairs of their own devices, and irreparable construction methods. They go to great lengths to ensure this, going so far as to serialize virtually every part, like camera modules, so they won\u2019t work, even if you swap them from one iPhone to another. They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts (sold illegally) from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits. The agreements with Apple\u2019s vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple. That means if you have a broken $5 microchip, you can\u2019t easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device, at a price that is not at all cost-effective, in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one. Although they do provide cost-effective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries.- Custom notification sounds: This is a huge one for me, because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket, and whether or not I need to read\/respond. This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what I\u2019m doing. Not possible on most iOS apps.- No universal back gesture: This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone. It\u2019s very intuitive and natural; if you want to go back, you just swipe from the edge of the screen. iOS doesn\u2019t seem to have any sort of universal \u201cback\u201d function at all. Sometimes, you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right, but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this. Also, even when it does work, swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do right-handed. The Android gesture is ambidextrous.- Desktop messaging: More \u201cwalled garden\u201d problems. In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer. On Android you can use whatever you want, it\u2019s just done through the browser. So I\u2019m forced to type on, and read from, my tiny little phone screen when I\u2019m at home, on that miserable little keyboard, instead of my 49\u201d desktop monitor and full-size physical keyboard.- Text selection: It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly, and for so long. I still don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time. Long-pressing on the screen brings up a magnified view, which is promptly hidden by the finger you\u2019re using to select when moving up. Moving this magnified view up\/down on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue. It could even be tailored to right and left-handed users, but that type of customization is atypical of Apple. You can also long-press on the space bar, but the thing moves so damn fast that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it. It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down\u2026- I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage. I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title. Instead I have to send through the contacts app, which makes it not even worth the effort. I just end up typing in my information, on that miserable little keyboard. I suspect this is another \"walled garden\" thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage, if you opt into it.- Weight: I guess some people equate a heavy phone with \u201cpremium\u201d build quality. I\u2019m of the opposite opinion. Pixel 5 is 151g vs. iPhone 13P 204g (35% lighter!). Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions. Most of this weight savings is derived from the (more durable) aluminum frame construction vs. heavier, more fragile \u201cpremium\u201d glass.- No plugins for Firefox (ad blockers, dark mode, etc). All browsers are modified versions of Safari.- Face ID: Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen, which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android. This is not an issue specifically with Apple\u2019s implementation of Face ID, but just the concept of Face ID in general. If you ask me, FaceID offers no benefits to account for this, and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor. Shortly after that, many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate (it's also just a more convenient location). Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived \u201cprogress\u201d while actually being the opposite, in my opinion.- Default SMS: If, for example, you wanted to use Signal, on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person you're messaging is not using Signal. Not possible on iOS.- Stupid fucking lightning cables: Absolutely no reason for these things to have them, but you have to spend another $100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around, in addition to USB-C cables for other devices, for absolutely no reason.- Aesthetics: Pixels and Google in general just feel very \u201cfun\u201d. Very colorful, and the Pixel UI reflects that, with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default, and \u201cMaterial You\u201d that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at. iOS, on the contrary, is fairly \u201cboring\u201d to look at, and does not change on a regular basis, much less in the last 5? years.- Slow charging (7.5W wireless, 20W wired). Bit of a nitpick here since they\u2019re more efficient and have smaller batteries, but many Android flagships are running 45-200W charging. My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless (with compatible charger, obviously). Not a huge issue either way for me, personally, as I\u2019m never far from a charger for very long.- Siri vs. Google Assistant. Google Assistant is still just so so much better.- Cost: the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was $1k. The Pixel 4a I had previously, which is, in my opinion, superior, was $350.Conclusion: The iPhone works better but the Pixel\/Android does more. I think that\u2019s the most succinct way I can put it.Apple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability, efficiency, ecosystem, and speed but just flops on the easy stuff, which is such a shame. It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000% better. I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality.","106":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.","107":"With June around the corner, millions of users will lose access to unlimited High Quality Photos storage. If you have an OG Pixel or are willing to spare double-digits dollars, you can easily sync your new phone's captures to your old Pixel for unlimited backup at Original Quality. Below I'll describe how I use [Syncthing-Fork](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid) to automatically and instantly sync photos with insignificant battery drain. We'll also touch on battery maintenance for the OG Pixel, such as cycling the battery with a smart plug, [Tasker](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm), and [AutoInput](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoinput).---#Installation and Folder Selection [Syncthing-Fork](https:\/\/github.com\/Catfriend1\/syncthing-android) is a \"Syncthing Wrapper for Android.\" I originally used the official app but battery drain was consistently high and the connection was not stable. The fork resolved both issues for me. Install Syncthing-Fork on both phones so we can select the relevant folders. Open the app and hit `Menu (\u2630) > Web GUI > + Add Folder > General`. * `Label` your folder whatever, e.g. \"Camera\"* `Path` to the relevant folder, e.g. `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/DCIM\/Camera` Go to the `Ignore Patterns` tab to exclude things. I don't sync thumbnails (high frequency changes) or photos queued for deletion (unimportant) and input `*thumbnail*` and `*trashed*` on separate lines in the text box. You may also add paths to subdirectories that should be ignored, such as `Messenger`. Note the operator guide under the text field.Finally, go to the `Advanced` tab:* `Type` as \"Send Only\" so external devices can't modify your new phone's files* `Pull order` \"Oldest First\" because ??? This is unimportant because syncing occurs so frequently that your pool is only 1-2 items. * `Save`Repeat the above steps for additional folders except do not repeat individual `Ignore Patterns` because we can do it globally later. Finish adding your folders. Remember that subfolders ARE included. Each sync'd folder will contain `.stfolder` and other `.stremoved*` files. Removing these files will break your sync. To fix, simply replace the removed file with one of the same name. Learn more about ignoring files [here](https:\/\/docs.syncthing.net\/users\/ignoring.html).I sync the following folders* `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/DCIM\/Camera`* `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/Movies\/`* `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/Pictures\/`If you created a folder and specified `Ignore patterns`, you should have a '.stignore' file in your `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/DCIM\/Camera` folder. Copy that to your root direction (e.g. `\/storage\/emulated\/0\/`). Open `.stignore` with a text editor and it should look like this:> `**.thumbnails`  > `(?d)**thumbnail**`  > `**.trashed*`    > `**.tmp`Right now, it will ignore any files and folders with those terms in their names. Please modify however you want per the linked documentation above. Include directories with respect to the root directory (e.g. `!(?d)\/Movies\/Messages`).---#Syncing to OG PixelOn your new phone, `Syncthing-Fork > Menu (\u2630) > Show device ID`.

Kinda pricey, would not recommend.The absolutely best method requires you have a bootloader unlocked OG Pixel so you can install [acc by VR25](https:\/\/github.com\/VR-25\/acc\/releases) alongside [AccA by MatteCarra](https:\/\/github.com\/MatteCarra\/AccA\/releases). This method will allow you to directly power the device and bypass the battery entirely. If the device loses power, it will revert to battery. Unfortunately my version is from Verizon (but was only $60 mint condition) so I had to use Tasker and AutoInput.Install Tasker\/AutoInput, then go through the setup and accessibility and write secure adb stuff. Each app will walk you through how to do it.Create two Tasker profiles with state = `power` and source = `AC`, and toggle `Invert` for one. First profile is `Invert` and turns on the plug when your battery drops too low. Second profile turns off the plug upon your specified charge level. There's some stuff with AutoInput I'm too lazy to explain at the moment, but here's my tasks ([to turn on charger](https:\/\/taskernet.com\/shares\/?user=AS35m8mGsA8aGfmf4DUXCBRb5YEzCAiP1MgGf5ZDirUBHL9i9OnWONuPxxhrHm%2F5FI%2FS&id=Task%3AAC+Off%2C+%3C30%2C+ON), and [to turn it off](https:\/\/taskernet.com\/shares\/?user=AS35m8mGsA8aGfmf4DUXCBRb5YEzCAiP1MgGf5ZDirUBHL9i9OnWONuPxxhrHm%2F5FI%2FS&id=Task%3AAC+On%2C+%3E70%2C+OFF)). Link your profile active when power is on (AC not Inverted) to the task that turns off when the battery hits 70. Link the Invert profile to the one that turns on when the battery hits 30. I can confirm it will automatically turn off at 70%. I will update if it doesn't turn on or there are any update. Assume the taskernet link is the most up-to-date.","108":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950.","109":"It was brought to my attention that I forgot to specify which pixel.  It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly.","110":"**NOTE: Please see updates at the bottom**  **NOTE: Final Update 12\/14\/2022 will be found at the bottom of the post**I purchased a Google Pixel 5a back in April.

I have a $500 paper weight sitting on my desk.**Updates:**I wanted to provide a couple of updates based on some of the comments.* The phone was not purchased by Google, but through mint mobile.  Mint is pawning the issue to Google, as they state that their warranty is straight from the manufacture.  Their RMA page did not work, and this is the response I got from them when reaching out to the support:[https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lCnqZJT)* Regardless, Google should honor the warranty when bought through a third party reseller, as stated clearly on their website:[https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer](https:\/\/support.google.com\/store\/answer\/6160400?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmade-by-google-devices-bought-from-approved-third-party-retailer)[https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL](https:\/\/imgur.com\/1JZKlrL)* Some have suggested that I go into a uBreakFix and have them deal with it.  I tried that already, they sent me away saying I need a warranty claim number from Google for them to work on it.* No the phone was NOT damaged* Even if the warranty was not valid for some reason, Google should at least give an explanation for why, not jus this BS answer of \"its not eligible, because its not eligible\"* Because no modern day human can go without a cellphone, I had to go buy a new phone in the meantime.  I went with a OnePlus and have been very pleased with it, for far less money than the Google Pixel.  So at this point a replacement would be nothing but a waste of my life, as I would have to sell it to get my money back.  The hours of my life that are lost are a separate issue, which also has me bitter over this entire experience.* To those accusing me of lying about talking to Google on the phone, there IS an option for them to call you when chatting with support.

However I am still stuck because I had to buy a new phone in the meantime, so its still a loss for me.  I am going to sell the phone, but I won't get back what I paid.  Because of this, I will be leaving this post up as a mar on Google's reputation which is well deserved. ","111":"Hey r\/GooglePixel,I\u2019m not super Reddit-savvy, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down.","112":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google.","113":"I am an iPhone user that has been eying the switch to Google or Samsung ever since they committed to 7yr extended software support like Apple. I use Windows and am fed up with Apple's \"walled garden\" nonsense so I'm ready to switch.My Verizon app offered me a free Pixel 9 Pro on my existing plan with a 3yr commitment, I have no plans to leave so this seems like a no brainer. Final cost is $100 in taxes and setup fees for a $1K phone. But when I called my local Verizon store about the deal, the store manager strongly recommended that I stick with iPhone or go with Samsung if I want to switch, but they require a plan upgrade as well. He said that he's had so many customers complain or return Pixel phones for random hardware and software issues and even viruses. Most of the tech reviews I've seen for the newer Pixels seem very positive so I'm confused.In your experience as actual Pixel users, are his concerns valid? Have you had many issues with your phones?EDIT:Thank you all for your feedback. Sounds like the vast majority of you are happy with your Pixels. I decided to skip the store and just get the Pixel 9P on Verizon's website. I'm excited for the new phone! Hopefully I can navigate my way through Android, but if I have issues at least I know there is a very active subreddit here.","114":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!","115":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","116":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market.

You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Best regards redditors,Linkakox","119":"I'm so frustrated with this phone at this point.&#x200B;It's less than a year old. I received it November of last year.\u2022 It randomly stops charging before reaching full charge. Stopped charging at 8% last night and died before I even got in my car to drive to work.\u2022 Battery life is extremely inconsistent.\u2022 Charge times are extremely inconsistent. Right now I have it connected to a 2.4-amp USB port with a 3-amp cable and it says \"slow charge, 18 hours to full charge\"... Which means that even with a 2.4-amp port and a 3-amp cable it's charging at less than 277-milliamps... In the last 2 hours it's gone from 13-14%. Then I used it for a call, while still on the charge cable, and it dropped to 12%.\u2022 The battery is clearly bad and has very high internal resistance and yet Google nor Verizon's warranty provider will do anything about it. They plug it in, stick their finger in their nose and say \"Well it looks like it's charging to me...\"\u2022 I live in SoCal. It's...warm. To say the very least. Within 5 minutes of getting in my car, if I don't hold the phone in front of an A\/C vent, it'll go into thermal protection and turn off all services.\u2022 If I'm sitting in the car with family, who are iPhone\/Galaxy users, I'll have no internet connectivity (despite having full or near-full bars) while everyone else in the car has connectivity. All of our phones are on the same plan.\u2022 While I know it's a 'feature' of Android and not the phone itself, I absolutely hate the 'swipe right to go back' 'feature'. It is infuriating.\u2022 The touch screen, when using multi-touch features (like zooming) is laggy.\u2022 I do a lot of close-in photography of motherboard components and the likes. The camera takes forever to focus, if it focuses at all.This phone is a mess. I'm very much considering having the battery replaced in my Pixel 2 and just going back to that.&#x200B;\/rant","120":"People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.","121":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!","122":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","123":"I've been on Android almost my entire adult life. Used Pixels the last 5-6 years, going from a Pixel 2 to 3a to most recently a 5. IMO the 5 was (is?) literally a perfect phone, the fingerprint reader is 100% accurate (with the tape hack), it STILL takes amazing pictures, amazing battery performance even after 3 years, etc etc. If it wasn't losing security updates I would continue to use it. However, recently I decided to try to embrace iOS considering a lot of the other tech in my house is Apple. I have multiple sets of AirPods, M1 Mac, as well as an Apple TV. I also wanted to feel what iMessage and Facetime were like after being denied them for so long. I got an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB on launch day and have been using it the last ~month. My impressions:### The Good* Of course, beautiful hardware. Definitely the best industrial design in the world for consumer electronics. * Performance hiccups are virtually nonexistent. * When you do things the Apple Way, or go 100% 1st party, it really does work well. Some examples would be things like the 1st party Mail app, Airpods switching seamlessly between MacBook to iPhone to Apple TV. Spatial Audio. ### The Bad* When you *don't* go 100% first party, or do things the Apple Way, the result is painful. Eg, not being able to set Google Maps to be the default mapping application is pretty annoying. * iMessage is cool but I've noticed that both Google and Apple appear to be converging onto some sort of frankenstein protocol where \"reacts\" from either system show up correctly on the other. I had a bit of an \"oh shit\" moment when I first texted someone on Android from my iPhone and they reacted to a message with a thumbs up and it showed up...fine. Same as how I could see iPhone reacts on Pixel. Okay. So really the benefit is just...read receipts, typing notifs, and high quality image sharing? * Facetime is awesome - but I can get an iPad for that seeing as the main use would be showing off my kid to his grandparents. * The camera is good, but...only perhaps marginally so compared to my 3 year old Pixel 5? This I think was the most surprising. I expected to be \"wowed\" by the camera considering the attention Apple gives it - and it's really just okay. I think I did not appreciate how far ahead Google is with computational photography. I\u2019m heard iPhone dominates when it comes to video and I don\u2019t doubt that. However I rarely shoot videos, or if I do, they\u2019re just for fun. * Photos management is a mess on iOS. This one was a big surprise to me. I thought as a \"creator's platform\" it would offer a lot more flexibility in terms of organization and management, not the case. iCloud is a very poor, unintuitive system. Pretty clearly designed for people who will get lost if any kind of folder system is introduced. ### The Ugly* I feel like I'm going fucking insane with navigation. In case you aren't aware, iOS **does not** have an analogy for the Android \"swipe from right edge inward\" motion. Instead, you have to reach to the complete opposite side of the device to do 90% of \"back\" functions. I've tried to get used to it and it's just not getting better. This is a huge deal! This is something fundamental about my phone that affects literally every app and every aspect of the experience. * Notifications on iOS are completely bonkers. Much less control, and handling any specific notification takes 2x-3x times as many taps or swipes as it would on Android. Hard to see, hard to manage. * Typing is an exercise in frustration. Even with using 3rd party keyboards, it just doesn't work very well and doesn't feel natural. Trust me, I've been trying to get used to it, but I think Pixel typing was just one of those things where I didn't realize how good it was until it was taken away. I could go on and on, but I think it's really disappointing how the iPhone hardware is top notch, absolutely beautiful in hand, but the OS itself is so so so locked down and dare I say \"dumbed down\". The answer to most of my dozens of \"how do I do this\" questions has been some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\/not using it as intended\". It's just incredibly frustrating for it to get such fundamental things wrong about how the user interacts with the system. And some of it is so simple, it just boggles the mind what the designers are thinking over in Apple HQ. It's almost like they're making decisions just to be different, or based on a model of user interaction that assumes the user is computer-illiterate. Which, fair enough! But it's not for me. Anyway, I just went to best buy today to see the size of the P8 in person and from what I could tell, it\u2019s really similar to the P5, which is a huge selling point for me. Will wait for them to become generally available and then get around to selling my iPhone and purchasing the P8.","124":"I just received them, maybe a mistake from Fnac... They work really well, I love them ~~but the Pixel Buds app don't work since it's not updated yet.~~ [More info about Pixel Buds app with the Buds Pro](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w7x9g1\/pixel_buds_pro_more_info\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Edit : 1 day laterHey there,I decided to tell you about everything I know and have tested about the Buds Pro, that you don't have to search all my answers through the comments. You can find all the pictures and the mic test about them [**here**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/w61knw\/comment\/ihbi45t\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**,** or in the comments.# How did I get them earlier ?I just ordered them on Fnac. The \"Pre order\" state wasn't there when I ordered it, so they shipped it as a normal package.# What's inside the boxWhen you receive your package, you will find in there the **carry case** where are the **Buds**. They are **already fully charged** (the Buds and the case) so you don't have to wait. You will also find **eartips** in a white tube, the instruction manual and the warranty one.There's **no USB-C cable** in the box, so be sure to have one or have a wireless charger.# Design and comfortI thought first that Buds pro were **very large** as we saw on Google pictures but **they are clearly not that large**. I have small ears and they fit in (pictures in the link above) so I'm pretty happy with. You can lay down on bed with them even sleep.**Buds Pro are definitely more confortable than the previous version** (I only owned the series A version). I wore them today for 6 hours without interruption and I don't have this little pain as I got with the series A. You completely forget them and **you also don't have the feeling of having your ears clogged**.The case feels nice and is more round-shaped than the series-A one, so a little larger. When I put them on light, there is also less reflexion on Pro case.# Are they secure ?Buds pro feels less secure than the Series A, but **they are still secure.** I was afraid first about them falling while eating, walking, running, biking, etc... But they are clearly not ! **You can definetly wear them while doing your favorite sport, just be sure to use the right eartips and insert the buds until that they feel snug and sealed.**# Touch controlsYou can **do everything you could do with the Series A** (check the manual on the pictures). Except that you **can also control the volume by swipping the Buds** and that pressing the Buds for 2 seconds ~~will not activate the assistant~~ but the ANC mode.# Audio qualityI can't describe the audio quality because I don't have the words for and every ears are different but they are better than the Series A.If you need the **bluetooth codec**, it's **AAC**.# Mic testI'm not confortable talking English but I tried. I don't have the perfect voice to mic test but you still get some samples.You can listen to the **4 samples** I did for you in the link above. **It has to be you to judge the microphone quality** because I don't care about the mic, I just need one who works well and where you can hear me clearly. They do it so they are fine for me.I also went outside, took my bike and drove around. I called my mother while biking, there was some wind, but she said that she can hear me clearly.# LatencyI tested the latency with Youtube and some games. **I didn't notice latency on Youtube**, but I think that normal. There's also no latency using my computer and playing some battle royale games as Fortnite and Naraka Bladepoint. Otherwise, **on some games** like Geometry Dash, Arcaea, **you can notice a lag between the image you see and the sound you hear...** I just tested those games, if you have more apps, or games, to ask me to try, just tell me.# Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode**ANC works pretty well.** I can't compare it with other device because I don't own earbuds with ANC, except the Bose 700 I got when there was Pixel 6 preorder. But ANC works. Just need to press one earbud for 2 seconds.If ANC is not activated, then the Transparency Mode will be active and it is a really really great mode. **You can hear all your surrounding** (voices, vehicles, noises, etc...) without taking off your Buds and **slightly louder than usual**. Even my voice was louder than usual lmao.FYI, you can't active both mode at the same time.# Multipoint ModeYou can definitely **connect the Buds Pro on two devices**. Even on a Windows computer. I didn't test on Mac because I don't own one, but I'm sure they do too.You can switch media pretty easily, but you have to be sure to pause or stop the media on the first device and then press play on the other.I also tested the feature I was watching a video on Youtube and asked my family to call on my phone. It works, well just in this way for now. The media you are playing will pause automatically and your buds will switch to your phone that you can answer.But I also tested when I was listening a media on my phone and then someone calls me on **Teams** or **Discord**. **Unfortunately** it doesn't pause the media on my phone, doesn't switch, and also you can't hear the bell of your computer. It will switch only if you are in front of your computer, see the call and answer it with your mouse. Maybe I did someting wrong...# Google AssistantAssistant works just by saying \"Hey Google\". ~~But~~ **~~I didn't find a way to activate it using the touch control~~**~~.~~ According to the manual, you have to choose between ANC control and Google assistant when you touch and hold the Buds. ANC control will be set by default. I'm sure you can change that using the Pixel Buds app, but it's not updated yet.# BatteryThe battery of the Buds Pro is great. It **lasts long**. I just wore them for 6 hours and they went from 100% to 30%. **Both buds** **discharge equally**. They still can have 1 or 2% of difference but it's random.They c**harge up really fast tho**, I'm even surprised about how fast they are when charging up. Even the case wirelessly (I actually use the Pixel Stand 2nd Gen). You can use your Pixel 6 to charge them.# Connection IssuesI didn't have connection issues for now.# Is it worth the upgrade ?I was particularly afraid about the Buds was not secure at all, large that you can't lay down with them and that I will keep the Series A in this cases. But I was completely wrong. I can get rid off my Series A, get rid off the little pain in my ears and give it to my family. So, in my opinion they are worth and also because you can control the volume using the touch control. I will not make a Youtube video about them because I don't have the confidence for it, I let all experimented Youtubers do it when they can.If you are in low budget, you can still get the Series A, they are really great too.That's what I tested with the Buds Pro, I hope that helps you to choose if you want to keep your first version, your Series A or if you want to upgrade it. Excuse my English too, I'm doing my best for you beside I'm French.I'm gonna enjoy them for a while now ! If you need more pictures, more samples, or others questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Best regards redditors,Linkakox","125":"I was lucky to get to try a pixel 8 pro at my local store and there are some things i have noticed. I dont think tech reviewers have talked about this but i still wanted to point out some of the stuff that felt different\/same.- Less wide more narrow: The pixel 8 pro display has an aspect ratio of 20:9 vs 19.5:9 as it was on the pixel 7 pro which makes the phone feel smaller than it is. Reminded me of an galaxy s21 ultra which can be good and bad as media consumption and webpages looks a bit off if you are coming from pixel 6 or 7 pro.- Haptics are much stronger and more refined! Android 14 makes haptic feedback much more noticeable than before and feels very nice when typing something or moving across the interface.- Bad news. pixel 8 pro feels just as hot as pixel 7 pro does when doing stuff on your device. Of course it never was too hot as i had experienced on my own 7 pro but it does not bode well as even the same areas feel exactly the same.- Same dumb fingerprint scanner. Feels exactly the same which isnt surprising since its the same physical scanner from the 7 but hoped it would at least feel more accurate but doesnt. - Speakers sound better? Its hard to tell since it was inside a store but they sounded nicer and felt more unified than before. But the buttom speaker is still a bit louder. - Feels very nice to hold but slippery as heckThese are just the things i have noticed, we will prob get more stuff as the reviews go live on tuesday. But handling the phone made me question if i even want a pixel 8 pro as i just cant decide if the change of aspect ratio was a good move or not as i prefered the more squarish look for consumption and web. Might have to get a galaxy s23 ultra and compare these two.EDIT:Since a lot of people are asking about how I got fingerprint to work. I just put the device into recovery mode and reset it then the phone works like a normal retail unit, since demo mode is just an app.","126":"I've been using the Pixel 8 Pro for approximately two weeks now. As a long-time iPhone user (I made the switch back during the early days of TouchWiz, for those who remember), I'd like to share my thoughts and review.    **Screen**:    Pros: The screen is overall excellent. While transitioning from the iPhone 13 Pro, I didn't notice a significant difference in quality, although the colors on the Pixel might appear slightly muted in comparison. The screen's brightness is impressive, making it highly visible outdoors. Additionally, it boasts sharp resolution, and I've kept it at the default settings.    Cons: One minor drawback is the brightness lag. Adjusting brightness takes a moment, and it can be a bit bothersome. It appears as though the ambient light sensor registers the surroundings only when the phone turns on, resulting in a brief delay in brightness adjustment.    **Performance**:    In terms of raw power, the Pixel 8 Pro is admittedly not as powerful as my iPhone 13 Pro. However, what most users truly care about is snappiness, and in this regard, the Pixel excels. Almost everything opens instantly (with 0.5x animations). The user interface is fluid, albeit somewhat less exciting compared to OneUI. However, it remains highly capable and well-designed. The only area of concern is RAM management, where Android 14's aggressive background task handling doesn't quite feel \"flagship\" to me. Nevertheless, the phone performs reliably and swiftly in meeting its intended tasks.    **AI**:    Google places a significant emphasis on AI. While it holds great potential, it's not particularly practical at the moment, primarily due to the time it takes for processing photos\u2014time that may not always be readily available when interacting with a mobile device. The photo features are impressive and remarkably capable but currently not a priority for me.    **Camera**:    Pros: The camera performance is widely acclaimed. Photos are exceptionally detailed and clear, with a remarkable night mode. The dynamic range surpasses that of my iPhone 13 Pro. Video quality is good, although iPhones maintain a slight lead, but not by a significant margin.    Cons: Lens switching is probably one of the worst i have ever seen. Apple engineers can't be that smarter to have figured the trick behind smoother transitions between lenses since the iPhone X. Like come on this is a flagship (or at least priced as one).  Front camera in application is dogwater, will talk about this in Apps segment.    **Battery**:    I've noticed mixed results in terms of battery performance:    On Wi-Fi: The battery performs admirably, offering over 8 hours of screen-on time for a variety of activities, from social media to YouTube and light gaming. It's important to consider that Wi-Fi usage typically occurs indoors, with moderate brightness and minimal GPS usage\u2014all factors contributing to extended battery life.    On 5G cellular: this shit is ass, yesterday i got aroung 2h30 of SOT from 97% to 15% using GPS for around 15min, 5G all day and browsing social media and texting (no calls) (X, instagram and WhatsApp) and listening to music. I don't know what modem Google is using inside this phone but they must change the supplier asap. it's horrendous.  **Apps**:    Here's where Android seems to lag behind iPhones, and the difference becomes quite noticeable:    Stock Apps: Many stock Google apps work seamlessly, including Settings, Gmail, Chrome, Drive, Clock, and Phone. However, some apps, like Camera and Google News, exhibit lag and unresponsiveness. Notably, the Camera app's viewfinder for photos is prone to lag, crashes, and occasionally displaying the wrong picture.    Third-Party Apps: This is a significant pain point. Waze, spotify, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Banking apps, Microsoft app suite run all MUCH better on iOS than Android, i just can't figure out why but it's facts.  When it comes to camera being used in apps, I won't even rant because people ask if im using some old emergency phone when in video calls. yes it's that bad.    Regarding the Reddit app on Android, well, let's just say it has  A LOT of room for improvement (we all know 4 interns made it...).    In contrast, most apps on iOS deliver a consistently smooth and fluid experience, creating an impression that everything was designed by Apple.    In summary, the Pixel 8 Pro is an excellent phone with minimal trade-offs. The camera is outstanding, the screen is beautiful, and the battery performs well on Wi-Fi. It's a no-brainer for Android enthusiasts, but the price point, at 1100 euros, may deter some potential buyers including me even though I pre-ordered it with the Pixel Watch 2.","127":"# Initial PostVery upset right now, as over a decade of Timeline data has been lost!* Last year (approx. Aug 2024), I followed all of the steps that had been emailed out to complete the conversation to local encrypted storage for timeline data.* My main phone is a Google Pixel 8, running Android 15 and generally the latest updates of all apps.* My Timeline settings were definitely set to \"**Backup: On; Auto-Delete: Never**\" last year, and backups would have been successfully uploading to the cloud backup for months.* Then suddenly on 09\/Mar\/2025, I noticed that my timeline data was mostly empty - losing over a decade of data.* When attempting to \"Restore\" from the cloud backup (*which is dated \"2 days ago\" as of now, so either 07\/Mar\/2025 or 08\/Mar\/2025*), - from any device including totally fresh ones - and **NO** data is returned from before \\~6pm GMT on Friday 07\/Mar\/2025.* This is despite the fact that I **KNOW** for certain that the decade of data \\*used\\* to be included in that backup before. (Because I changed phones late last year in November and everything was transferred over then).* After reading lots of other people's forum posts complaining about the same problem, it now doesn't seem related to specific phones \/ versions, as I've seen it happened to people with Samsungs and different Pixels, using anywhere from Android 12 to 15... (*It definitely just feels like someone at Google accidentally deployed the wrong thing or deleted something from production!*)* Some users report that their high level 'Places', 'Vists' and 'Countries' etc, still show the old totals. Unfortunatly mine have been reduced to patechic post-March 7th figures.Posting here, to see if this is effecting anyone else, and we can align with each other.*Note: My:* [first post on \/r\/google](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/google\/comments\/1j7u1k1\/maps_timeline_backup_has_lost_over_a_decade_of\/)*, and my* [community post on Google forums](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&sjid=10310876563270854239-EU).*Also, note: because there is a sea of Timeline support questions\/articles\/reddit posts\/etc. that are relating to the migration to local storage last year - this is NOT the problem here. I successfully migrated, and that was successful,*. ***Instead this is a sudden loss of previously backed-up data occurred in early March 2025.***\\-------------------------------------------------------------------# SummaryIt appears to me that, something out of our control (*possibly due to a bug in Google Maps app or purely on Google's servers*) caused the Timeline data to be **NOT ONLY**\u00a0deleted all pre-March 7th from **OWN LOCAL DEVICES (!!!)**, but **ALSO** has\u00a0**caused previously-successful \"Cloud Backups\" to over OVERWRITTEN with a backup containing no data from before March 7th...**I know this is the case for me because:1. Doing an import of the current cloud backup to a different new device contains no data from before March 7th.2. And I know for a\u00a0**certainty**\u00a0that that **SAME** cloud backup **USED TO** contain a decade of timeline data, because in November last year I did a factory reset of my device and all the data was loaded successfully after importing.I worry that, regardless of whether or not any potential bug is \"fixed\" in the Maps application going forward - for me and many others it might not make a blind bit of difference - as the data in the backup on Google's servers has gone, and could only possibly be restored by Google themselves in the back-end (*e.g. Internally restore a March 6th backup and enable users like me to be able to \"import\" that data backup*).And as far as I know, it has been **complete radio silence** from Google employees about this....On the Google Maps help community forums, the user '*Vishal Saini*' has been replying to anyone and everyone who posts about this, saying that \"*a bug may have caused this*\" and half-implying that a Google development team \"*may\"* be looking into it (*but I understand that he is not a Google employee and I have no reason to believe he has anymore information than we do...*). This is \\*not at all\\* reassuring because, as explained, I think this issue is going to require manual intervention by Google employees to re-consolidate\/make available each users' last successful backup pre-March 7th...As this is an issue **affecting at least** **~~dozens~~** **of users** who have cared enough to post online about it (*see below for a list*) - meaning that once you include all those who don't bother to post\/haven't noticed yet\/don't care - it's really likely an issue that is **affecting** **~~100s if not~~** **~~1000s~~** **of users**...*(****EDIT: Because within a couple of days, I have found many reddit posts; >50 community forum posts all posted in a single day, often with a couple of others sounding \"me too\" in the comments; and over*** [***620 people marking \"I have the same question\" to this one in 7 days so far***](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/329356095)***(!!!) I'd revise my estimate that the true numbers affected are much more likely to be in 10,000s of total users at the very least...)***Surely, with such a widespread outage, Google would be able to restore those previously-successful, now-deleted, cloud backups that they were were storing successfully up until at least 06th March 2025?!Or is this just unfortunately another lesson that mega corporations like this, can treat users like s\\*\\*t, by not even acknowledging anything happened, and it doesn't make a damn difference...\\-------------------------------------------------------------------# Resolution~~The closest so far is I got~~ [~~this response on the Community forums~~](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&msgid=330063355)~~:~~>*Vishal Saini: \"We have been receiving such reports since March 6\/7, 2025, it may be a transient issue, so you should wait for a few days. Alternatively, to check data availability, please try importing your data, if the backup option was enabled, this is a new option, for that you need to tap on the Cloud button - three dots - Import, if it doesn't work then try importing to a spare phone, if you have a spare phone, if none of the solutions work then you should wait for a few days, if it\u2019s a transient issue, otherwise, the timeline data deleted by the system cannot be recovered.\"*~~That gives a very slight slither of hope that it is a reasonably widespread problem that they are working on resolving and may fix itself in time... But if not, it's pretty shitty behaviour that they have deleted many users data that they explicitly stated was securely \"backed up\"...~~**EDIT: As explained above, I don't think this person works for Google, nor have I seen no evidence that he know anymore than we do -** [**he directly ignored my question about this when asked**](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&msgid=330260816) **- so I don't think listening to his speculation is any help....**The **FIRST** thing I recommend anyone who experiences this tries to do, is to attempt to do a manual backup of the unencrypted data. You can do this via:>`Phone's Settings > Location > Location Services > Timeline > Export timeline data`If this returns a small file, move to the steps below, but if returns a relatively large '.json' file (e.g. >1MB), then you likely have all the data contained in that file. It doesn't necessarily ever make it viewable in the Google Maps app, but at least you'd still have the data yourself... And you could then view it in another tool, such as:\u00a0[https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/](https:\/\/timelineviewer.pages.dev\/)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*(NB: I'm not verifying the safety of this particular viewer - but it's just an example of multiple that you find when googling, including self-hosted ones).* Unfortunately, for me this is only post-March 7th data.The following steps have apparently worked for people to recover, but unfortunately none have worked for me:1. Go into Timeline, and turn it off and then on again.2. Import from the timeline backups.3. Log in to Google Maps app from a totally fresh device.4.

Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons.","129":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950.","130":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","131":"I've been on Android almost my entire adult life. Used Pixels the last 5-6 years, going from a Pixel 2 to 3a to most recently a 5. IMO the 5 was (is?) literally a perfect phone, the fingerprint reader is 100% accurate (with the tape hack), it STILL takes amazing pictures, amazing battery performance even after 3 years, etc etc. If it wasn't losing security updates I would continue to use it. However, recently I decided to try to embrace iOS considering a lot of the other tech in my house is Apple. I have multiple sets of AirPods, M1 Mac, as well as an Apple TV. I also wanted to feel what iMessage and Facetime were like after being denied them for so long. I got an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB on launch day and have been using it the last ~month. My impressions:### The Good* Of course, beautiful hardware. Definitely the best industrial design in the world for consumer electronics. * Performance hiccups are virtually nonexistent. * When you do things the Apple Way, or go 100% 1st party, it really does work well. Some examples would be things like the 1st party Mail app, Airpods switching seamlessly between MacBook to iPhone to Apple TV. Spatial Audio. ### The Bad* When you *don't* go 100% first party, or do things the Apple Way, the result is painful. Eg, not being able to set Google Maps to be the default mapping application is pretty annoying. * iMessage is cool but I've noticed that both Google and Apple appear to be converging onto some sort of frankenstein protocol where \"reacts\" from either system show up correctly on the other. I had a bit of an \"oh shit\" moment when I first texted someone on Android from my iPhone and they reacted to a message with a thumbs up and it showed up...fine. Same as how I could see iPhone reacts on Pixel. Okay. So really the benefit is just...read receipts, typing notifs, and high quality image sharing? * Facetime is awesome - but I can get an iPad for that seeing as the main use would be showing off my kid to his grandparents. * The camera is good, but...only perhaps marginally so compared to my 3 year old Pixel 5? This I think was the most surprising. I expected to be \"wowed\" by the camera considering the attention Apple gives it - and it's really just okay. I think I did not appreciate how far ahead Google is with computational photography. I\u2019m heard iPhone dominates when it comes to video and I don\u2019t doubt that. However I rarely shoot videos, or if I do, they\u2019re just for fun. * Photos management is a mess on iOS. This one was a big surprise to me. I thought as a \"creator's platform\" it would offer a lot more flexibility in terms of organization and management, not the case. iCloud is a very poor, unintuitive system. Pretty clearly designed for people who will get lost if any kind of folder system is introduced. ### The Ugly* I feel like I'm going fucking insane with navigation. In case you aren't aware, iOS **does not** have an analogy for the Android \"swipe from right edge inward\" motion. Instead, you have to reach to the complete opposite side of the device to do 90% of \"back\" functions. I've tried to get used to it and it's just not getting better. This is a huge deal! This is something fundamental about my phone that affects literally every app and every aspect of the experience. * Notifications on iOS are completely bonkers. Much less control, and handling any specific notification takes 2x-3x times as many taps or swipes as it would on Android. Hard to see, hard to manage. * Typing is an exercise in frustration. Even with using 3rd party keyboards, it just doesn't work very well and doesn't feel natural. Trust me, I've been trying to get used to it, but I think Pixel typing was just one of those things where I didn't realize how good it was until it was taken away. I could go on and on, but I think it's really disappointing how the iPhone hardware is top notch, absolutely beautiful in hand, but the OS itself is so so so locked down and dare I say \"dumbed down\". The answer to most of my dozens of \"how do I do this\" questions has been some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\/not using it as intended\". It's just incredibly frustrating for it to get such fundamental things wrong about how the user interacts with the system. And some of it is so simple, it just boggles the mind what the designers are thinking over in Apple HQ. It's almost like they're making decisions just to be different, or based on a model of user interaction that assumes the user is computer-illiterate. Which, fair enough! But it's not for me. Anyway, I just went to best buy today to see the size of the P8 in person and from what I could tell, it\u2019s really similar to the P5, which is a huge selling point for me. Will wait for them to become generally available and then get around to selling my iPhone and purchasing the P8.","132":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices. To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone. ","133":"Not sure why, but I just wanted to put this somewhere and I found this Reddit to be the most fitting. I just want to release some steam.Me and my wife have been a Pixel (and Nexus) user from day one. Imported Pixels from other countries, just to be able to use them: USA (Pixel 1 and 5), Germany (Pixel 2XL, 3, 4, 4XL and 6) and next to this the Nexus 5, 5X and 6P (a.k.a. the skateboard or banana). Convincing my family to also go for the A-series of the Pixels and they really like them. They're not power users: 3G connectivity is fine, pictures should be good and battery life of 1 day is fine.Only, since I have replaced my Pixel 5 for an 8 (finally a smaller one!), due to a bad battery, I have been struggling. I know - especially from the Nexus-era - day-one devices aren't always great and you could need a couple of weeks for the software to get bug-free. Not really had this problem with my other Pixels, but that's mainly because I've never bought them new.I'm using the Pixel 8 for almost a month now and I feel like I have paid 675 EUR for a mid-range device with a great camera (that has to be said), but very bad battery performance and connectivity issues. My Pixel 8 will not last a day, even with 2x 45 minutes of wireless charging in my car when commuting. During wireless charging and wireless Android Auto, it gets super hot (even without a case) that my music will stutter. When picking it up to see, it feels very hot as well and it even states a warning about low performances due to the internal temperature.Since a week or so, I have disabled 5G as I have read that 5G drains the battery even faster due to a not-so-optimized modem. It is a bit better now, but only with about 10% in the late afternoon. I don't even use social media: I mainly use my phone to chat via Whatsapp (which I also do mostly via my Macbook), scroll through Reddit (is that social media?) and listen to music, but only in my car. I browse from time to time, but that is mostly it. No games, no movies, no streams.I kinda regret my so-called upgrade as it most definitely doesn't feel like an upgrade. I don't want to use any other Android brand as I believe a company that creates both the hardware and the software should provide the best experience: Apple iPad, Apple Macbook, Microsoft Surface, Google Pixel. It is true for most devices in this row and it has been true for the Pixel series as well, up until now. I even kinda feel like I should have gone for the iPhone 15, while I don't even like Apple that much: I mean, it works flawlessly as a laptop to me and my iPad for drawing is also great, but I don't pick up my iPad that much for any other app. I mostly use my phone and I have been a proud Android user forever, since I switched from a Nokia with keyboard to the OnePlus One.**Edit 1:** I don't even have high refresh rate on. Just rocking 60 Hz.**Edit 2:** Small update: I have set back everything to the settings I have had before, being:- 5G enabled- Adaptive connectivity- BT enabled (and NFC\/GPS)- No smooth display (so 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz adaptive)- Dark mode- Previous default dark backgroundI have been using my phone now for about 7 hours and am at 48%. Working from home, so great WiFi connectivity. Nothing really strange here, only in my Batteryusage overview I see:- 19% Maps (SOT: 12 min. \/ Background: 9 min.)- 16% Spotify (Background: 20 min.)- 10% Android Auto (Background: 1 hour 23 min.)Rest is 5% or smaller.I did drive my car today, 2x 10 min. with Wireless Android Autio (yes, I have a USB-C cable laying in my car now, but I wanted to test out the 'original 'situation'). I did not use Maps and I did not use Spotify. Although, both are enabled (Spotify paused) with Android Auto in my overview screen.So, I think Android Auto + the fact that AA uses a lot of these resources as well, take a lot of the battery juice remaining.Next drive I will use wired AA and see what that will give. Most likely, less impact from AA, but still the same impact from Maps and Spotify even when not actively in use.**Edit 3:** I have checked my old Pixel 5 via the ADB commands on this Reddit shared: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/gge9cd\/reading_battery_health_statistics_actual_capacity\/ - I find that my Pixel 5 has 665 cycles and 3408 mAh left from the original 4080 mAh. I am thinking of replacing the battery, but do you think this would help? It's a relieve just to hold that phone, so light.A reputable repair company charges 60 EUR for a battery replacement, only they say there is a high chance of breaking the screen, which is on my own risk and costs 299 EUR. I won't be doing this myself and I'm really not looking for another second hand - used - phone from 2020 with the same battery quality.**Edit 4:** I'm at 3 hours 3 min. of SOT, still with the 3 above being the biggest battery drainers. Now on 20%, 17% and 11% respectively. Didn't use AA in the meantime. Got 16% battery left.**Edit 5:** I'm at 3 hours 20 min. of SOT at 1%. Battery saving kicked in at 10%. SOT is 7% of the total of system. My wife has a Pixel 6 and has 5 hours of SOT and 30% remaning. She is using Instagram, Snapchat, etc. socials, Vinted\/Chrome (shopping) and YouTube and such all day.I also see Mobile network has a total of 19 min. but is 56% of the total battery used. This is outrageous!**Edit 6:** Another day another test. I'm ay 51% right now with 51% SOT. I have disabled 5G again as it couldn't find any network, so back on 4G again which at least is stable. Most used app is WhatsApp with 13% battery usage. Mobile network at 39% (been out a lot today). Will result in about 3 to 4 hours of SOT by the end of the day.","134":"I used to be a hardcore flagship user back in 2015 and had an OG OnePlus One. I've been through midrange Nokia's and a pixel 4a since then and NONE of them have had issues with CPU performance (especially when playing basic games like 90% of the market)I picked up a Pixel 8 and I'm very happy with my purchase but the constant \"wahhhh NoT SnApDrAgOn Gen X\" is dumb.Only the hardcore users do what would be considered \"proper gaming\" on their phones. The most demanding thing I play is Pok\u00e9mon Go and the phone handles that without issue...May I remind you that Snapdragon has a terrible support record not just in terms of allowing 3 years of software updates but looking at the wearable market... It took Samsung to come in and kick them up the butt to make actual decent smart watch processors. TL:Dr you do not need the performance of the latest Snapdragon processor if you just use the phone to browse the web \/ social media \/ the odd lite game like doodle jump or whatever is popular.If you're going to complain you should have bought something else and it's on you for your buyers remorse","135":"I've been using the Pixel 8 Pro for approximately two weeks now. As a long-time iPhone user (I made the switch back during the early days of TouchWiz, for those who remember), I'd like to share my thoughts and review.    **Screen**:    Pros: The screen is overall excellent. While transitioning from the iPhone 13 Pro, I didn't notice a significant difference in quality, although the colors on the Pixel might appear slightly muted in comparison. The screen's brightness is impressive, making it highly visible outdoors. Additionally, it boasts sharp resolution, and I've kept it at the default settings.    Cons: One minor drawback is the brightness lag. Adjusting brightness takes a moment, and it can be a bit bothersome. It appears as though the ambient light sensor registers the surroundings only when the phone turns on, resulting in a brief delay in brightness adjustment.    **Performance**:    In terms of raw power, the Pixel 8 Pro is admittedly not as powerful as my iPhone 13 Pro. However, what most users truly care about is snappiness, and in this regard, the Pixel excels. Almost everything opens instantly (with 0.5x animations). The user interface is fluid, albeit somewhat less exciting compared to OneUI. However, it remains highly capable and well-designed. The only area of concern is RAM management, where Android 14's aggressive background task handling doesn't quite feel \"flagship\" to me. Nevertheless, the phone performs reliably and swiftly in meeting its intended tasks.    **AI**:    Google places a significant emphasis on AI. While it holds great potential, it's not particularly practical at the moment, primarily due to the time it takes for processing photos\u2014time that may not always be readily available when interacting with a mobile device. The photo features are impressive and remarkably capable but currently not a priority for me.    **Camera**:    Pros: The camera performance is widely acclaimed. Photos are exceptionally detailed and clear, with a remarkable night mode. The dynamic range surpasses that of my iPhone 13 Pro. Video quality is good, although iPhones maintain a slight lead, but not by a significant margin.    Cons: Lens switching is probably one of the worst i have ever seen. Apple engineers can't be that smarter to have figured the trick behind smoother transitions between lenses since the iPhone X. Like come on this is a flagship (or at least priced as one).  Front camera in application is dogwater, will talk about this in Apps segment.    **Battery**:    I've noticed mixed results in terms of battery performance:    On Wi-Fi: The battery performs admirably, offering over 8 hours of screen-on time for a variety of activities, from social media to YouTube and light gaming. It's important to consider that Wi-Fi usage typically occurs indoors, with moderate brightness and minimal GPS usage\u2014all factors contributing to extended battery life.    On 5G cellular: this shit is ass, yesterday i got aroung 2h30 of SOT from 97% to 15% using GPS for around 15min, 5G all day and browsing social media and texting (no calls) (X, instagram and WhatsApp) and listening to music. I don't know what modem Google is using inside this phone but they must change the supplier asap. it's horrendous.  **Apps**:    Here's where Android seems to lag behind iPhones, and the difference becomes quite noticeable:    Stock Apps: Many stock Google apps work seamlessly, including Settings, Gmail, Chrome, Drive, Clock, and Phone. However, some apps, like Camera and Google News, exhibit lag and unresponsiveness. Notably, the Camera app's viewfinder for photos is prone to lag, crashes, and occasionally displaying the wrong picture.    Third-Party Apps: This is a significant pain point. Waze, spotify, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Banking apps, Microsoft app suite run all MUCH better on iOS than Android, i just can't figure out why but it's facts.  When it comes to camera being used in apps, I won't even rant because people ask if im using some old emergency phone when in video calls. yes it's that bad.    Regarding the Reddit app on Android, well, let's just say it has  A LOT of room for improvement (we all know 4 interns made it...).    In contrast, most apps on iOS deliver a consistently smooth and fluid experience, creating an impression that everything was designed by Apple.    In summary, the Pixel 8 Pro is an excellent phone with minimal trade-offs. The camera is outstanding, the screen is beautiful, and the battery performs well on Wi-Fi. It's a no-brainer for Android enthusiasts, but the price point, at 1100 euros, may deter some potential buyers including me even though I pre-ordered it with the Pixel Watch 2.","136":"I love a lot of things about the pixel but as a long time iOS user I'm having mild buyers remorse \/ anxiety! I have 8 days left to trade the phone back ... Would love some reassurance from longer-term pixel users. I will say some stuff I love so far is + Design, the Hazel is stellar + Google makes everything \"easy\", it's well explained and covers most of the bases youd have questions around from switching over + Google ecosystem works great for productivity + Pictures are fun to take and the quality is imo better for the casual enjoyer+ Customization but won't get into it as everyone knows this already + Google is putting in effort to be consumer friendly, while apple recently has been trending opposite.+ Cost to package ratio. Some stuff I'm having anxiety about - accessories are what I miss most about apple... Really liked my Apple watch and airpods. I have pixel buds now and they just don't hit how I hoped - unfortunately I'm one of the users affected by scroll stutter and lag in many apps like Reddit, FB, YouTube and instagram, makes me feel like the phone is less \"premium\". On android 15- Google photos just isn't as seamless as iCloud photos imo, it syncs inconsistently for me- switching between cameras is VERY choppy - app performance, I feel as if the QAQC of 3rd party apps is not up to par with apple, the difference between optimization of different apps is noticeable, whereas on iOS they are all generally similar to where you don't feel much of a difference ","137":"First off, I am basically the textbook definition of an Apple sheep. I am completely bought into the \"walled garden\" with many of their products and services. I upgrade my iPhone every year, watch every launch event, and talk about their superiority whenever the topic came up. I never thought I would like or want to use an Android phone again, after having multiple in years past. Then came the Pixel 6a.After starting my own business, I realized I wanted a second phone to keep my personal life separate. My iPhone would be the work phone, since I used the camera and Apple specific apps constantly for my business. Because I had the iPhone, I didn't want or need anything super expensive for the personal phone. Nothing extremely cheap, as I am a tech person and definitely prefer more premium products, but I didn't need to spend $1,000 on something to text and run social media apps. I originally started looking at the iPhone SE, as it was cheaper and I would still be in the Apple ecosystem. But after watching a few reviews on it, people kept comparing it to the Pixel 6a which seemed better in many ways. I always had a special interest in the Pixel series, even as an Apple fanboy, due to the cameras and stock Android. One of my main complaints with every Android I've had has been the bloatware. After doing plenty of research, I saw the 6a was on sale for $350 at Target, and decided to pick one up to try it. Much to my surprise, I love it. This thing is amazing for the price (and I see it's down to $300 now? Total steal.) The things I like most about it:Stock AndroidThe stock Android on Pixels is miles better than any bloatware-ridden Samsung phone I have ever used. This phone is incredibly fast, smooth, and feature-rich without a million random pre-installed apps. I love the Material You customization and the Google assistant integration (which is miles ahead of Siri.) The CameraWhile it does have the older Pixel camera set-up, and you can definitely tell in some conditions, the camera on this little guy packs quite the punch. I've especially noticed this with close-up shots, I did some macro comparisons with my 14PM, and the Pixel was much clearer with better color. The portrait mode is nice, it has that artificial feel to it, but so do the iPhones. The astrophotography mode is fantastic, and even the normal night mode does a good job. Also, the magic eraser feature is insanely good. I showed it to a couple of my friends and they couldn't believe it.The HapticsWhile I'm a big fan of Apple's haptics, I have to say I enjoy the hard-hitting haptics of the Pixel. The feedback you get while doing everything from typing to switching apps seems much more pronounced than the iPhone. This could be due to it being such a smaller and lighter phone, but the weight of this phone is a plus for me as well. It feels like nothing in my hands compared to the brick that is the iPhone.Overall, I guess when compared with my iPhone, it shocks me that a phone this good can be priced this cheap. I've certainly enjoyed my experience with it over the past month, and am already looking at the 7 Pro for that camera set-up, seeing how much I like the cameras on the 6a. I will probably force myself to wait for at least the 7a, if not the 8 though. Pixel, congratulations on turning an Apple sheep into someone that now has green bubbles.","138":"I've been using the Pixel 9 Pro XL since October, and here are some of my observations, experiences, and disappointments. I was previously an iPhone user (from the iPhone 8 Plus to the 14 Pro Max), but before my first iPhone, I had a Galaxy Note 5, so I know how using an Android phone is. I returned to Android with the Pixel 9 Pro because of its advertised AI features, and because I wanted more customization options.  It's been a bit jarring to realize that Android still isn't as smooth and polished as iOS.While Android offers many software features I love, such as Gemini, instant Google search, and text selection from the home bar\u2014things I wish Apple would integrate\u2014the app optimization is baffling!  Apps often look better and function more smoothly on iOS. For example, WhatsApp's UI is far superior on Apple, and the scrolling through apps and web pages are smooth like butter on iOS compared to Android.Another frustration is third-party launchers. I expected them to work seamlessly, but the phone glitches every time I try to return to the home screen. The default Pixel Launcher works perfectly, but I really want to customize my home screen without these annoyances!And to add to the list of my frustrations, I find Google photos to be lacking a lot in terms of navigation through media compared to iOS.I know, I could just ditch this phone and go back to an iPhone, but I won't. I am in the looks for solutions since I'll be stuck with this phone for years and I like to tinker around.Any way, that's my rant. If anyone have any suggestions feel free to comment.Btw, Merry Christmas to everyone! ","139":"I'll preface this by stating that I have had several Pixels (1, 3, 5, 6Pro) and I also fully admit that I am a total Pixel fanboy. I decided to wait a week before sharing my thoughts on it.**Look\/Feel\/Aesthetics**Having used the 6 Pro for the last two years, I will chime in with all the other previous 6 and 6 Pro owners out there: the 8\/8 Pro feels like Google took the same phone and seriously refined the design of it. This is not a slight on Google at all, but a complement. My wife has a 7, so I also compared it to that phone a bit as well and came to the same conclusion. When you handle the 8 Pro, it  just looks and feels more \"premium\" than previous models.**Display**From the moment I turned the phone on and started opening apps, browsing Instagram and Chrome, even looking at the wallpaper that transferred over from my 6 Pro, it just all pops so much more. It's smoother and transitions and animations just seem to be a bit cleaner on it. Oh, and that brightness outdoors as well! The first time I looked at it in direct sunlight I was doing a double take. I've gotten fairly used to the slightly dimmer screens from the previous Pixel models and I read that they were going to improve that with the 8 models, but this really is next level. Putting it side by side with my 6 Pro and my wife's 7, you really can see a noticeable improvement.**Camera**As a professional photographer, a Canon R5 is my primary tool of choice. However, I don't take it with me everywhere. One of the reasons I really enjoy the Pixel line is that I always have a great camera with me wherever I go. The 8 Pro is no exception to that and is more than up to the task of taking amazing photos. If you're like me and need to take professional photos for use on social media several times a day, the 8 pro is more than capable of doing just that. I always liked having the 4x optical zoom on the 6 Pro, so the 5x zoom felt like a natural bump in reach. The Pixel phones have always impressed me with their great photography and the 8 Pro continues that trend for me. The pro controls are also a very nice addition that I will be taking advantage of.**Battery Life**While I never really had a huge issue with this on my 6 Pro as it did everything I needed a phone to do within a day, I can honestly say that the battery life is better on the 8 Pro. However, I will also say that some of that is due to Android 14 being that much more efficient than Android 13 since I also got better battery life out of my 6 Pro once it was upgraded to 14 as well. That being said, going two days on a charge without having to turn on battery saver is very nice! Keep in mind that I've mostly been on wifi at home and the office for the past week, so my take on this might change once I take the 8 Pro with me into the field to some areas with bad cell signal.**Performance\/Speed**I really haven't met an app or usage scenario wherein my 8 Pro slowed down or gave me a bad experience. All of my apps are super snappy and responsive and Android 14 works fantastically on the phone. As with my previous Pixels, I really don't have any complaints as to usability. It just works, and works great!***TLDR: The Pixel 8 Pro is an amazing phone and I highly recommend getting it. You will not be disappointed!***","140":"Hey everyone, I know you're not big fans of negative opinions, but I wanted to share my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL after using it for almost 10 days. At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all.","141":"Hey r\/GooglePixel,I\u2019m not super Reddit-savvy, but I don\u2019t know where else to go. I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down.","142":"I am an iPhone user that has been eying the switch to Google or Samsung ever since they committed to 7yr extended software support like Apple. I use Windows and am fed up with Apple's \"walled garden\" nonsense so I'm ready to switch.My Verizon app offered me a free Pixel 9 Pro on my existing plan with a 3yr commitment, I have no plans to leave so this seems like a no brainer. Final cost is $100 in taxes and setup fees for a $1K phone. But when I called my local Verizon store about the deal, the store manager strongly recommended that I stick with iPhone or go with Samsung if I want to switch, but they require a plan upgrade as well. He said that he's had so many customers complain or return Pixel phones for random hardware and software issues and even viruses. Most of the tech reviews I've seen for the newer Pixels seem very positive so I'm confused.In your experience as actual Pixel users, are his concerns valid? Have you had many issues with your phones?EDIT:Thank you all for your feedback. Sounds like the vast majority of you are happy with your Pixels. I decided to skip the store and just get the Pixel 9P on Verizon's website. I'm excited for the new phone! Hopefully I can navigate my way through Android, but if I have issues at least I know there is a very active subreddit here.","143":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!","144":"Hi \/r\/GooglePixel, I'm Mishaal Rahman. You may know me as the guy who wrote that [absurdly long Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) or as the former Editor-in-Chief of *XDA-Developers*. I'm here because Android 13 will soon be released, and I figured not everyone here is clued in about what's included in the update. If you have a Pixel 4 or later, you'll have plenty of opportunity to play around with it soon if you haven't already enrolled in the beta. If you want a summary of what features to look out for, though, I've got you covered.Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think Pixel users like you should be aware of. I'll start out by listing 10 features that will likely only be used by Pixels (current and future) or at the very least will arrive first on Pixel, followed by 50 features that should be common across Android 13 devices. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. For the 50 non-Pixel-exclusive Android features, I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in the list. Still, there's a lot that's new in the Android 13 update, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!Without further ado, here's my list:1. [**Cinematic wallpapers**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). In Android 13 DP2, I discovered strings within the WallpaperPicker app that suggest you'll be able to \"make your photo a 3D wallpaper that moves when your phone moves.\" The Android System Intelligence app is hinted at being as the system's wallpaper effects generation service, ie. it'll be what actually turns photos into 3D wallpapers. Keep in mind this feature isn't available yet, and it could never launch. This could be something Google is holding off until the Pixel 7 or maybe Pixel Tablet launch.2. [**Resolution switching**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#resolution_switching). Pixel devices have never had a way to switch between FHD and QHD resolution (on devices where that might make sense, like the XL\/Pro models with QHD panels). Android 13, however, adds \"screen resolution\" settings that appear whenever a FHD and QHD display mode are exposed to Android. No Pixels right now do that, but there are rumors that the Pixel 7 Pro's panel will support FHD as well as QHD. The reason? Slightly better battery life when running graphically intensive apps. [Here's a screenshot of what the page will look like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-screen-resolution-settings.png?resize=540%2C1170&ssl=1)3. [**Hub mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#hub_mode). Android 13 is preparing a hub mode feature that will let users access apps across profiles. Right now if you want to access an app from another profile, you have to switch to that profile. With hub mode, you'd be able to access them from, say, the ambient display. There's not a lot that's known about this feature, and it could have been pushed back to a future release, but I'm thinking it's aimed at shared devices like what the upcoming Pixel Tablet seems to be (ie. a hybrid of a Nest Hub + an Android tablet). [Here's a screenshot of the trusted network settings for Hub mode](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1). [Another](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-hub-mode-trusted-networks.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Screen saver revamp**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#screen_saver_revamp). Another feature that's likely aimed at the Pixel Tablet (but also other shared\/dockable devices) is the revamped screen saver experience in Android 13. You probably won't see this on your phone ever, but Android 13 can show complications (yes like the watch kind) on top of screen savers. There are complications for air quality, cast info, date\/time, and weather. [Here's a screenshot of the complications toggle](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-complications-toggle-in-screen-saver-settings.png?w=598&ssl=1) and [some complications showing on the \"Colors\" screen saver.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Colors-screen-saver-with-complications-overlain-in-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)5. [**Media Tap To Transfer**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_tap_to_transfer). Android 13 adds support for Media Tap To Transfer, a feature that will let you send media from one device (like a smartphone) to another (like a tablet). The actual media transfer will likely be handled by Google Play Services, and (I'm guessing) this feature could debut with the Pixel Tablet. Despite its name, the transfer protocol could be NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, or something else.6. [**Multiple Enabled Profiles on a single eSIM**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#multiple_enabled_profiles). Want to ditch your physical SIM card? Android 13 adds support for eSIM MEP, or Multiple Enabled Profiles, to let you simultaneously use two or more SIM profiles stored on a single eSIM chip. I don't know which Pixels will support this, sadly.7. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/) with it. You'll need a device that supports pKVM, like the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and I think 6a. 8. [**exFAT support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#exfat). You can finally mount an exFAT drive if you have a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a! This only works on Pixels with Linux 5.10+, but as for why it also requires Android 13, [the reason is kind of silly.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-27-exfat-on-pixel-532176849\/)9. [**Ambient Context events**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#ambient_context). You know how the Nest Hub can detect your coughing or snoring? Remember [the rumor](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2022\/05\/26\/pixel-android-snore-detection\/) about Google adding \"built-in\" snoring\/cough detection for Pixel? That will likely make use of Android 13's Ambient Context API. There's already [a hint](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1530017887854813184) that Digital Wellbeing will make use of the API.10. [**Cross-device calling**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cross_device_calling). When the Pixel Tablet comes out, I'm sure you'll want a way to take a phone call on it when your phone isn't on you. Through Android 13's cross-device calling API, this could be possible.11. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).12. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)13. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).14. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).15. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 16. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)17. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)18. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.20. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.21. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)22. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)23. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 24. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 25. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.26. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)27. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).28. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)29. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.30. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 31. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)32. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)33. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).34. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)35. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)36. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.37. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)38. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)39. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.40. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.41. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)42. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)43. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.44. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.45. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)46. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.47. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.48. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.49. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.50. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.51. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.52. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.53. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.54. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.55. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.56. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.57. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.58. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.59. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).60. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","145":"**I have Pixel 7a AMA****Pixel 7a FULL HONEST Review**https:\/\/youtu.be\/NgI1g_Bhv9Q**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Cy79qgXTpU**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a FULL Comparison, To Upgrade or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/wgp3HCXr8V0**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 Camera Comparison**https:\/\/youtu.be\/pxARU2-pm6k**Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 FULL Comparison, To Save or Not?**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dl5Q2LR7zW4**Am I breaking NDA?** Nopes, got it off the used phone market.

Used Pixels the last 5-6 years, going from a Pixel 2 to 3a to most recently a 5. IMO the 5 was (is?) literally a perfect phone, the fingerprint reader is 100% accurate (with the tape hack), it STILL takes amazing pictures, amazing battery performance even after 3 years, etc etc. If it wasn't losing security updates I would continue to use it. However, recently I decided to try to embrace iOS considering a lot of the other tech in my house is Apple. I have multiple sets of AirPods, M1 Mac, as well as an Apple TV. I also wanted to feel what iMessage and Facetime were like after being denied them for so long. I got an iPhone 15 Pro 256GB on launch day and have been using it the last ~month. My impressions:### The Good* Of course, beautiful hardware. Definitely the best industrial design in the world for consumer electronics. * Performance hiccups are virtually nonexistent. * When you do things the Apple Way, or go 100% 1st party, it really does work well. Some examples would be things like the 1st party Mail app, Airpods switching seamlessly between MacBook to iPhone to Apple TV. Spatial Audio. ### The Bad* When you *don't* go 100% first party, or do things the Apple Way, the result is painful. Eg, not being able to set Google Maps to be the default mapping application is pretty annoying. * iMessage is cool but I've noticed that both Google and Apple appear to be converging onto some sort of frankenstein protocol where \"reacts\" from either system show up correctly on the other. I had a bit of an \"oh shit\" moment when I first texted someone on Android from my iPhone and they reacted to a message with a thumbs up and it showed up...fine. Same as how I could see iPhone reacts on Pixel. Okay. So really the benefit is just...read receipts, typing notifs, and high quality image sharing? * Facetime is awesome - but I can get an iPad for that seeing as the main use would be showing off my kid to his grandparents. * The camera is good, but...only perhaps marginally so compared to my 3 year old Pixel 5? This I think was the most surprising. I expected to be \"wowed\" by the camera considering the attention Apple gives it - and it's really just okay. I think I did not appreciate how far ahead Google is with computational photography. I\u2019m heard iPhone dominates when it comes to video and I don\u2019t doubt that. However I rarely shoot videos, or if I do, they\u2019re just for fun. * Photos management is a mess on iOS. This one was a big surprise to me. I thought as a \"creator's platform\" it would offer a lot more flexibility in terms of organization and management, not the case. iCloud is a very poor, unintuitive system. Pretty clearly designed for people who will get lost if any kind of folder system is introduced. ### The Ugly* I feel like I'm going fucking insane with navigation. In case you aren't aware, iOS **does not** have an analogy for the Android \"swipe from right edge inward\" motion. Instead, you have to reach to the complete opposite side of the device to do 90% of \"back\" functions. I've tried to get used to it and it's just not getting better. This is a huge deal! This is something fundamental about my phone that affects literally every app and every aspect of the experience. * Notifications on iOS are completely bonkers. Much less control, and handling any specific notification takes 2x-3x times as many taps or swipes as it would on Android. Hard to see, hard to manage. * Typing is an exercise in frustration. Even with using 3rd party keyboards, it just doesn't work very well and doesn't feel natural. Trust me, I've been trying to get used to it, but I think Pixel typing was just one of those things where I didn't realize how good it was until it was taken away. I could go on and on, but I think it's really disappointing how the iPhone hardware is top notch, absolutely beautiful in hand, but the OS itself is so so so locked down and dare I say \"dumbed down\". The answer to most of my dozens of \"how do I do this\" questions has been some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\/not using it as intended\". It's just incredibly frustrating for it to get such fundamental things wrong about how the user interacts with the system. And some of it is so simple, it just boggles the mind what the designers are thinking over in Apple HQ. It's almost like they're making decisions just to be different, or based on a model of user interaction that assumes the user is computer-illiterate. Which, fair enough! But it's not for me. Anyway, I just went to best buy today to see the size of the P8 in person and from what I could tell, it\u2019s really similar to the P5, which is a huge selling point for me. Will wait for them to become generally available and then get around to selling my iPhone and purchasing the P8.","147":"Google is knowingly still selling phones that won't connect to 911 and it almost cost my child his life last week. My Pixel 6 Pro failed to connect to 911 over 17 times. I purchased it directly from Google \/Google Fi in August. I do not, nor have I ever had Teams installed. I've not had any other call or service failures prior to or after. The issue is exclusive to calling emergency services. Details: On 9\/27\/22, I received a call from my sitter saying that my five year old had begun seizing and was unresponsive. I told her I was on my way, and I would call 911. (So that she could focus on my child and trying to keep him safe under the circumstances) I tried calling 911 at least 17 times on my Google Pixel 6 Pro from the time I left my office, and it failed to connect every single time. I tried dialing direct from the keypad, I tried from the emergency lock screen, I tried everything. I'd not had any service or call issues before that point. Thank God my work was only five minutes away the way I drove, and Andrew was still breathing when I got there. Once my child was stabilized and here at Wolfson's, I began looking into the issue. It turns out that this is a known issue with Pixel phones. Other users have experienced technical glitches preventing them from calling 911 during a life or death crisis. Google knows this, did not release an alert or statement upon learning about it, eventually released an update that allegedly fixed the issue in older pixel phones, but not 6 or 6 pro, which I just purchased. Users of these phones may find themselves or their loved ones dead because Google, the largest tech company on the planet, can't seem to fix this issue and doesn't have the moral backbone to pull the phones from market until they do, or at the very least make current users aware that they may be not be able to contact emergency services when needed - the absolutely most vital function of any phone.If you've had this happen, please message me on here or leave a comment about your experience.","148":"My local Best Buy had the 7 and 7 Pro on display. I was able to spend some time checking them out. Here are my thoughts and things to note. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to help. For comparison I cannot comment on how they compare to the 6 and 6 Pro in terms of camera and performance, considering I only had my 4 XL on me. I was unable to test anything battery, or unlocking wise.**Design\/Hardware**Both devices are nice, and feel premium. I was a tad underwhelmed though, because they seem very similar to the 6 & 6 Pro devices. The size of the 7 feels perfect, and I much prefer the flat display. The 7 Pro curved sides have been reduced from the 6 Pro last year so that's a good improvement. The Obsidian\/black model was the only one on display. It picks up a lot of fingerprints, and feels like the same finish as the 6 series. I'll be curious how the Snow and Hazel colors compare. The 7 camera bar and side rails are matte, which I prefer. The 7 Pros looks nicer, but it's glossy which isn't for me. **Display**Both devices are very bright. For the limited time I spent, I couldn't notice a quick difference between the 120 hz and 90 hz screens. **Camera** The 7 Pro selfie cam gives you a wider angle than the 7. The back camera can zoom in much further. On the 6 Pro I had owned, I often had issues with low light on the selfie camera. The processing would make you look like a water color painting. I'm a tad worried that the 7 and 7 Pro is using the same selfie camera, and will have the same issue. I could only test this in the store, so I do not know forsure how selfie photos will look in bad lighting situations. But from what I was able to capture, the selfies did not seem super sharp. I'd expect in sun light they will look very good as they have in the past. For the Macro Focus mode, I was unable to figure out how to use that on the 7 Pro. There wasn't anything obvious that said Macro in the camera app. I thought by focusing on something up close with the ultrawide lens would allow me to do that, but no help there. One thing I did notice as an upgrade from the 6 Pro to the 7 Pro, was on the 6 Pro as you zoom in on a subject, you could really notice when the camera switched from the main lens to the telephoto. On the 7 Pro, the switching of the lens is a lot more smooth, and less noticeable.**Conclusion** The Pixel 7 ultimately is the better value. I'm someone who really cares about the camera specs, but for the 7 Pro you're essentially paying $300 for a telephoto lens, more RAM, and a larger battery. So if those matter to you, and you don't mind the 6.7 in display, then go for the Pro.Something I'm also realizing with Pixels, is that unless you're upgrading to a device with major hardware upgrades, you're going to have a very similar experiences, since the software is so consistent and we all get software upgrades. I'd imagine iPhone users have similar experiences. If you want something that really feels new, then I'm starting to realize you're better off switching OS's or manufacturers.What I'll be most curious from reviews are, do the overheating issues still exist, how's the battery, how's the face unlock compared to the Pixel 4, and has the fingerprint scanner improved at all.My phone history includes:* ^Droid ^Bionic* ^Samsung ^Galaxy ^s3* ^Samsung ^Galaxy ^Note ^4 * ^Samsung ^Galaxy ^Note ^7 ^[RIP]* ^Samsung ^Galaxy ^s7 ^Edge* ^Google ^Pixel ^2 ^XL* ^Google ^Pixel ^4 ^XL* ^Google ^Pixel ^5a* ^Google ^Pixel ^6 ^Pro* ^Google ^Pixel ^4 ^XL ^[returned-the-6-pro]","149":"So I know there's been so many of these posts but I just wanted to be another voice to say that all these reviewers who are saying the pixel 5 is bad are looking at it from such weird angle. I got my pixel 5 a few days ago to replace my OnePlus 6. My pixel has been hands down already a better experience. I know that the OnePlus 6 was one of their peak phones: super snappy, great screen for its price and awesome build quality - but the pixel 5 with its \"worse\" processor and un-flagship nature is 100% better. I've been able to do everything that I could do on my OnePlus 6 just as, if not better, on my pixel. It's snappy, super smooth and looks even better playing games like real racing and PUBG compared to my 6 thanks to its 90hz and graphics. Even though the pixel has a \"budget\" processor it absolutely flies through tasks despite it being a little worse than the 845 my old phone had on paper. Things that people have been complaining about like speakers, haptics or build seem to me as completely wrong. I love the way that the sound comes right at you through the screen like on those expensive Sony TV's. And the haptics are honestly up there with the typing experience on my GF's iPhone XS. I also love the playful sorta sage and the feel of it. It almost looks like it's made of felt or something when you look at it. With the built in positives of wireless charging and water proofing. Battery life has also been stellar and the 5G speeds and reliability are absolutely awesome.So, I honestly hate how much this phone copped from reviewers and users. Yes it's different to the fully fledged, throw everything we have approach of previous pixels but I'm very happy with the lower processor but keeping everything else to give me a flagship phone for $999AUD compared to the $1250 or $1400 for other flagships. For me in Australia this has been cheaper than even a oneplus or s20 fe with a free nest hub max to sweeten the deal. Nobody really uses their phone for demanding tasks and I reckon you'd be hard pressed to notice an improvement between the pixel 5 and other flagships like the S20. People seem to think that everyone needs the best processor for all the 4K editing and hardcore gaming they're going to be doing. Nobody actually cares, the difference between recent processors and performance have been so minimal you couldn't blindly tell the difference between a phone from 3 years ago vs today. 90hz or above is the new and only way to make a phone feel faster. TL:DR the obsession of critics and reviewers that no price of tech is good unless it has the cutting edge features even if it's completely overkill has given this phone some very mixed reviews and receptions. Anyone who was to buy this one would be hard pressed to find a major flaw. It's got everything you need in a phone for a cheaper price.","150":"ChatGPT wrote this for me because my English isn't great \ud83d\ude05I purchased a Pixel 8 Pro last December and was initially impressed with its performance. However, a few weeks into using the device, after installing both my primary internet SIM and an eSIM, I began experiencing significant signal drops. At first, I suspected the issue might be related to the eSIM, as my provider restricts access to LTE unless you're subscribed to an internet package. This led me to believe that my phone was attempting to connect both SIMs to LTE simultaneously. Unfortunately, disabling the eSIM did not resolve the issue, and the signal drops persisted.After several frustrating months of dealing with this problem, I decided to reach out to Google Support. This took longer than expected, as finding a direct way to contact support was not straightforward. After finally getting in touch with them, I was asked to submit a bug report. Following that, I began what turned out to be an extended period of waiting.For over a month and a half, I was in regular communication with the same Google representative, who thanked me for my patience and reassured me that the issue would be addressed in a future software update. Trusting the process, I continued to wait, but after three months of updates, the signal drop problem remained unresolved.I reached out to Google Support once again, and this time they suggested that I send my device in for repair or replacement. Due to my location outside the U.S., it took me about a month to send my device in for servicing. Eventually, Google replaced the device and shipped it to a relative in the U.S., who will now forward it to me.I am now hopeful that the replacement device does not suffer from the same signal drop issue. However, I wanted to share my experience in case others are facing similar challenges with their Pixel 8 Pro. If anyone has encountered this issue or has any advice on how to prevent it from recurring, I would greatly appreciate your input.Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing any suggestions or solutions that might help.","151":"I ordered the Pixel last year on day one of reservations. I was all in. It's been a great phone. The only problems I've had are the charge doesn't last quite as long as I would hope and an app that would play audio at random times when the phone wasn't in use (which was fixed relatively fast). Other than that it was the most reliable, easy to use phone I ever had and the photos are great. Like beyond great. This thing takes [amazing photos](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/pixel\/). Even in the long term reviews that have been trickling in this year people are saying it's the best smartphone they've ever used.---------------------**ffwd to the Pixel 2**When I heard about the Pixel 2 I was excited. Then came all the news; There's no SD card, the bezels are huge, it's not called \"Nexus,\" it's too expensive, there's no wireless charging, no dual cameras, there's no bixby button, it's plastic looking, WHERE'S THE HEAD PHONE JACK???I was pissed too. Especially about the headphone jack thing. What the fuck was Google doing. I like my Pixel, why didn't they just take that and make it better?Then I thought about it. *How many times had I used my headphone jack in the past year?* Twice. That's it. Two times. I used wireless headphones on the subway and my car connects through bluetooth.  Now people's situation may be different but was I really going to let a feature I used twice dictate my purchase?How about the lack of dual cameras. Google's claiming the [dual pixel thing](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/pixel-2-is-so-good-it-doesnt-need-dual-cameras-google-says\/) is as good as dual cameras and less clunky. The original Pixel's camera was the best available when it came out. I love what they have created before. I'll give it a shot.Still no wireless charging though. Even back in the day [I jerry-rigged my S3 to have wireless charging](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/this-easy-hack-adds-wireless-charging-to-samsung-galaxy-s3\/), why doesn't the Pixel 2 have it? The fast charging is great. I guess it would be nice to have fast **and** wireless charging but if I had to pick between the two it would be the fast charging hands down.Okay, but what about the *no micro SD card thing*. This is where I think Google is making a huge shift in the way we store stuff on our phone. Google photos has unlimited storage, I don't need an SD card for that. My music is all on Spotify. I can get another TB of storage on Google Drive for $99 if I really need it (that's like 8 micro 128 GB Micro USB cards, although it's not instant). I know all of these solutions require data. But in a pinch I can use my [USB flash key chain](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B015QJ0X1U\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).But that price is killer right? I'm not a fan of giant phones, they don't sit well in my hand so I'm looking at getting the regular version. 64 GB is enough memory. So I'm paying $649. A little steep but the new ~~iPhone 8s~~ iPhone X is $999. It's not even close. Also, Google is buying back my used Pixel for $350. So in the end I'm upgrading my phone to a flagship Android device that I've loved the previous generation of for $299._______________________Hate on it as much as you want but the Pixel 2 is going to work. Google here is trying to create something that makes using a phone simpler and more reliable. There might be things that are inconvenient to get used to but overall I think it's going make using a phone less of a hassle and more intuitive. In a time where both Samsung and Apple's last flagship phones had issues with smoking and literal explosions I don't mind sticking with Google, even if that means I can't use the headphone jack twice a year.","152":"3 days in a row now my Nest Mini has unassociated itself with my Google account overnight, this not waking me up and asking me to reset it up in the Google home app when  I ask it to tell me the time And another side note I don't know if it's just me but the past month or so all my Google devices have started to slack in some way or another. Fist was pixel buds Wich are completely useless, my Bluetooth on my phone no longer tells me the song title on displays it cast to. no one can understand me when I'm using my speakerphone on my 4XL. my ticwatch  will no longer stay connected to my phone for more than an hour without having to reset or reconnect. I don't know if it's this whole covid thing but I am seriously tempted to leave the Google ecosystem due to all the flaws right now. I'm hoping that this is just a brief lapse in quality control and they can get their foot back in the door to some good products or good software for the product.","153":"Having spent a couple days using my new Chromebook, I\u2019ve developed some initial thoughts.  The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:**Hardware:** Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring \u201cthump\u201d rather than a plasticy \u201cslap\u201d.  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.  **Keyboard:** I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I\u2019d enjoy \u201chome\u201d and \u201cend\u201d buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google\u2019s 2 year cloud storage service) **Screen:** The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.**Camera:** The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven\u2019t tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s fine.**Speakers:** can get very loud and sound good on hard surfaces**Ports:** the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven\u2019t tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.**Computation:** ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can\u2019t help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I\u2019ve managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.**Chrome OS:** The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I\u2019ve seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn\u2019t much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren\u2019t yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn\u2019t yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google\u2019s update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.**Apps:** I haven\u2019t played with these too much but I\u2019ve found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn\u2019t supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven\u2019t turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won\u2019t work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I\u2019ll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.  **Extras:** 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn\u2019t have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I\u2019m pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn\u2019t a \u201cfull computer\u201d, the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I\u2019m happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I\u2019m happy to be in \u201cwork\u201d mode on my Chromebook.  When it\u2019s time to play, I\u2019ll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.  Less is more; Chrome OS is my 5th screen.  ","154":"I used to love android deviced, google, youtube and other services it would offer. But now some of these services are plauged with big flaws that are about to drive me out of the ecosystem. For example, let's start with youtube. For all its hood for it has its problems people just seem to accept. The tiny details in how it works is very irritaiting. My first gripe is that when watching on my tablet I go to click fullscreen mode, a reasonable request. But nearly everytime I go to click the icon, youtube thinks I am clicking on the red timeline and advances it. And because youtube is not properly maintained and updated when the timeline advances, the time stamp gets magically frozen and does not change. So once this happens I am unable to see how far into a video I am without restarting it, which when watching things like podcasts is not viable given they are generally over an hour.Then again with youtube, videos do not load well. I dont have a great connection but it can and has played thousands of videos in the past without problems. Now recently at the beginning of nearly every video there is a substancial gap in preformance in what I usually enjoy. I have to pause the video and wait a solid 30 seconds or more most times to get the video to properly wotk. Note that once I do this the video is COMPLETELY fine for the rest of its duration, so its not my connection or it would constantly be spazzing out.I know this is a free service and I have little room to complain, but I did buy youtube red for 1 month and experienced some of the issues above, so when people pay for a service like youtube red, they expect it to work well. Not have tiny problems that the company could find with some more Q&A.Now i will move my rant over to google music.I won't discuss in great detail how I frequently am unable to play a specific song, for no reason. Or how it randomly turns on when my phone is in my pocket, asleep. No, I want to talk about the data usage. I used to buy individual songs and albums before I bought their music streaming service. But once I subscribed to it for some reason my data usage went through the roof. I never downloaded any songs before I subscribed to google play music, but all of a sudden by listening to the same ammount of music i always do, in 1 week I use more data than I had the previous month. That makes no logical sense since I was streaming in both instances.The reason I think Is because of the youtube video link under every song. They must load the video before you play the song on google play music. If I want to watch a youtube video I will go to youtube, instead of you putting it on my screen while im listening to music. I went through the google play music settings, and nothing can turn off the youtube video availability thing and it pisses me off.  And even after 3 weeks of not using google play music at all it has used 1\/3 of a gigabyte of data just because of it background running. The fact that it is wasting my data when I even went into my settings and forced stopped it is unreal.I have endured these issues with no real way to tell google and youtube about them in a way which I know will create change. But if I can't get these issues solved let me be a cautionary tale, do not buy googleplay music subscription or youtube red because they are irritable under deveoloped software which will leave you annoyed and angry you spent money on them.","155":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\*****TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.**\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.","156":"2 years I've used this routine.   \"Ok...turning off all lights.

I drive a 30 year old car and I keep my phone plugged in via aux, and have it on a magnet mount on the dashboard, so I have always used Google Assistant to play any specific songs I want to hear so that I don't have to touch my phone while driving. I know the interface with Tidal is a little jank, but the solution of just asking it \"play x song\" while the app is focused worked for me.Now, the other day, I wanted to hear Smooth Operator... I ask, \"hey google, play smooth operator\", and instead of the easy, simple, useful answer of \"ok, asking tidal to play smooth operator\" and the song beginning... I get Gemini's LLM slop as shown in the video (used a different song in the video as at this point I had parked and was just demonstrating). I tried a couple more times in a couple different ways, very much distracting me, and I ended up waiting for a stop sign and then typing in the song name. I'd imagine many others in my situation would just type it in whilst driving.I am now aware that you can switch back to the regular Assistant in settings. However, this is just incredible to me; change the default from something that so many people use and rely on, to a LLM that realistically provides no actual benefit beyond what Assistant already did. This should be opt-in, not opt-out. This is not even to mention the fact that now my data from the original question was fed into the LLM, regardless of whether or not I consented (I know, privacy is dead, but still).Just a rant. Pixel 6a on latest Android 16 Beta 2, in case anyone is wondering.","159":"I'm talking about AI here artificial intelligence. In the name it says intelligence but there is known there. In my opinion, these things that say they are artificially intelligent are only running off some lame script. Oar running inside a defined set of parameters to the point where you can't ask it a normal question and get a straight answer.. example number one Gemini by Google. This one I think is by far the stupidest of them all. Even with the upgrade to Android 15 and supposedly pro version of Gemini still the dumbest AI I've ever come in contact with. Prior to the Android 15 update  It encourages you to conversate and ask questions So that's what I did. I was asking theoretical and hypothetical questions. And most the time I did not have an answer and it will definitely not to just speculate take a guess on anything. I also found out three times where it gave me incorrect information and I corrected it. But on the third time which it had said something about gravity being a scientific fact which it is not. It is a theory I I told it he was wrong again and that gravity was this and he said well. It is a well-studied theory. Doesn't make it a scientific fact. I said and then it wouldn't talk. It shut off and said you asked too many questions and refused to come on through hey Google or actually pushing the microphone to speak after it repeated over and over during these conversations that it wasn't capable of emotions or other things. It just now displayed emotions by shutting off of refusing function after it got told it was wrong. Then after the Android 15 update I say what the heck. I'll give it another whirl cuz I didn't use the pro version before so I turn it on and it starts to speak and I tell it that I didn't like that voice that it used. I would like to change how it sounds and change the voice on him. He said as an AI text model I am uncapable of producing a voice. I said what really then what am I hearing? Oh there may be another app doing that or some other device? No actually you're producing sound and you kept arguing with me saying that he is not capable of producing sound. So I asked him if he could learn. He said yes. I said well learn this that you are producing sound every time I quit asking you questions and he said oh even though I'm sorry for all this confusion, but I am not capable of producing any kind of a sound really. At that point I didn't even wanted to talk to it anymore so I shut it off and opted back for the normal Google Assistant which is 10 times smarter. So why would you want an AI model of anything that isn't smart? The whole point of having an AI is so that you makes your life easier and on that note almost none of them can function the machine they're on. How is that making my life easier? They can't perform simple tasks like opening a website or going to page you tell them to or taking a translating what was on the screen right now or searching with picture that was on the screen they cant do that. Most of them can't even do that. What good is an AI if it cannot function the device that comes on? I don't want an AI that produces artwork. Our work is supposed to be done by humans with emotion. That's what makes artwork good emotions. If machines can't feel emotions they don't have no business doing artwork. I don't need an AI. That'll sit there and talk to me I don't need a computer friend. I need a machine to do things that I want.  You know the helping dictate with college papers may be good for a college kid helping analyze data. Maybe it's good for some people but I wanted to function the machine when my hands are full or something. Hey turn this off. They can't do these things and why by all means Google of all people would put out something that was inferior to the assistant that runs their phones already. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. The only way that gemini is better than normal. Google assistant is is. It can answer every question you put in there with a voice and assistant says here's the results from the web. Well at least the assistant does everything you wanted to with your phone mostly! Please","160":"First off, I apologize if this is something that has been discussed somewhere in this subreddit, but I'm about to be charged 20 bucks a month for something that I don't even want. I had the, I believe, Google one with, I think, 500 GB cloud storage and the benefits that go along with that and was paying $1.99 a month. That was perfect for my needs.    However, like a fool, I decided to give Google one with Gemini 2 TB storage on a 2-month \"free\" trial. I absolutely hate gemini and the way the entire system operates versus the traditional \"hey Google\" non AI version. Of course I've changed my settings to where I went back to the traditional voice assistant, but that doesn't change the fact that it appears my previous plan is no longer even an option. I want my my old cloud storage version back or at least one that is not literally 1000% more expensive than my previous plan. I enjoy the photo editing features that come with Google one, so I don't want to rid myself of it unless I have to. If I do change from Google one to something else for cloud storage, what are the recommendations for easy migration of all of my things? Is there a way I can revert back to my previous plan that apparently is no longer available or I'm just not tech savvy enough to find it? Happy Cake Day!

I can sort of understand the stateless, any device, no need to know if someone is offline\/online bullshit they're trying to do, but I really can't fathom why you wouldn't include a contact list. Even Facebook let's you create a favorites list. **2. Can't launch voice only calls.**If I'm on 3G on my phone or I just don't want someone to see me, why can't I do a voice only call? Didn't they literally create the XMPP standard for this?**3. Can't view or set status\/status messages (except the little green bar when you're already talking to someone).**What kind of idiot would remove this feature? Literally every IM program since ICQ has had this. I understand they're trying to have a sort of stateless messaging service, but you can have it both ways, just by adding an option to view or not view statuses. **4. All outbound chat appears in the sent mail folder in Gmail.**Is this by design or just a bug?**5. No SMS.**There is a Gmail Labs SMS feature and Google Voice's SMS feature, but it doesn't incorporate either of them.**6. No Google Voice integration.**I had to switch back to Google Talk in Gmail to get this working again. **7. Chat history is compltely broken.**Let me explain, if you haven't noticed it yourself. Let's say Bob messaged me on Google Talk at 1\/1\/2010 - 3:30 PM.(Open chat window)1\/1\/2010 3:30 Bob: Hi Grayone.1\/1\/2010 3:31 Me: Hi Bob.1\/1\/2010 3:32 Me: Sorry Bob I have to go.(Close chat window)This chat would appear in Gmail, under the chats folder as a single entry, like this:\"Chat with Bob (3 Lines) Jan 1 2010\"After Hangouts has been introduced every chat I've had with Bob during the last few weeks shows up as one entry, \"Hangout with Bob\". It's an infinitely scrolling list. I thought I could break it up by pressing \"Archive Hangout\", but even though archiving the hangout creates another \"Hangout with Bob\" entry in the chats folder, it's still the same infinitely scrolling list.This is a really bad design. Let's say I want to see a chat with Bob I had in 2008, I can search Gmail for \"subject:chat bob after:2008\/1\/1 before:2009\/1\/1\". The results will look like this:\"Chat with Bob (44 Lines) Jan 27 2008\" \"Chat with Bob (231 Lines) Feb 4 2008\"\"Chat with Bob (10 Lines) April 2 2008\"Etc...In a Google Hangout world, my entire seven year history of chats with Bob would show up like this:\"Hangout with Bob\"If I wanted to see a chat that I had with Bob in 2005, I would have to keep scrolling up for what could literally be hours depending on how many chats we had. It would be really, really, easy for them to fix this - they could call it legacy mode. They can present the new dumbed down experience and you if you like it, great for you, but if you're a corporate user or a power user, click a button and have it turn back into an actual IM client.At this point, besides the video chat, most IM clients circa 1998 are more functional then Google Hangouts. They totally fucked this up. ","163":"When I learned of Google's promotion offering up to $300 to trade-in an older Pixel for a Pixel 6a I was excited. What a great opportunity to upgrade! I've had a Pixel phone ever since the Pixel 2 and I've been happy with each one. So I went to the Google Store and quickly placed two orders, one for me and one for my wife (the store only allows one trade-in per order). I received a confirmation email and eagerly awaited our new phones... I had no idea of the struggle that was to come.The next morning, I get an email: \"Your Google Store order was canceled.\" Then another identical email for my second order. I'm confused, but surely the body of the email has a clear explanation, right? Wrong. The entire body of the email was:\"Your order was canceled because it doesn't align with our [Sales Terms](https:\/\/store.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/about\/device-terms\/).\"I click the link and read through the document (written in language more for lawyers than the average consumer), and can find no explanation for what went wrong! So I think to myself 'Surely the helpful people at Google Support can sort this out!' So I try the live chat.The live chat person (or possibly Google-developed AI? LaMDA?) Explains that my order was canceled because it didn't align with the Sales Terms and said I could find more info in the email I was sent. Clearly, this person is not familiar with what these cancelation emails look like. I explained that the email has no additional info and that I have read the terms and still don't understand. I was then told that my case would be escalated to a supervisor and I should receive an email within 24 hours. Here's the email I receive:  https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6dwsn5hef1q91.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9326b9c27f356bb1c8d67ea83aff93aa5863cf85Now I am struggling to understand, not only why my orders were canceled, but why nobody at Google is able to provide an explanation! I've read the sales terms and am certain I am in compliance, but it seems some Google algorithm disagrees and no human is both willing and able to review my orders and fix it. I tried again to order a Pixel and the order was canceled again with the same non-helpful \"explanation.\"I tried calling one of the physical Google Stores in NY for help, but all I got was a recording the ends the call at the conclusion of the recorded message. I called Google headquarters in CA and the called just ended after navigating an automated menu and then waiting on hold for several minutes. I even reached out on Twitter. Having exhausted the normal methods of support I could think of, I decided it was time to escalate matters! I found the contact info for the executives at Google on a consumer advocacy page. I explain my situation in an email to the gentleman listed as the primary contact. I'm uncertain if the executive actually received my email (I suspect Google has a bot and algorithm that filters these matters for them), but I did get an email from the \"Executive Escalations Team\":  https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d5tlqmldi1q91.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=359c0e6125c78c0660f53647b3db4b78bd1a6c70At this point, I'm pretty skeptical that the Pixel Supervisor will be any help, but I reach out again, hoping that Alex may have been able to make a difference. I reply to Jonas and wait. As expected Jonas was not helpful. He once again pointed me to the cancellation email and said there was \"not much information to share.\"At this point, I should have abandoned trying to be a Google customer. All my friends that have heard this story are in agreement there. They have all said something like 'Why did you still do business with them?' or 'It's never been that hard for me to buy an iPhone.' There is no logical reason why I continued down this path. I just stubbornly wanted to get to the bottom of why my orders kept getting rejected.After some thought, I decided to try having the phones shipped to my friend that lives 30 minutes away. I submitted the orders and waited. Then I get an email that my orders have shipped! Finally!All this headache, simply because Google won't ship to the address where I live. Mind you, I live in the contiguous US. The address I tried to ship to is the same address on my driver's license, car registration, and car insurance. USPS, UPS, FedEx, Amazon, and DHL all deliver here. To make it even more infuriating: nobody at Google (even up to the Executives) could just tell me that!A quick Google search shows that this experience is not unique to me. Many people deal with their Google Store orders being canceled with no useful explanation provided.After this ordeal and non-support from Google that followed, I am a Pixel-Promoter no longer. In fact, I feel embarrassed by the times I championed Google phones in the past. I can't help but contrast this experience with the time I walked into an Apple store with a water damaged and out-of-warranty iPhone, desperate for help. I walked out of there with a replacement phone at no cost to me. I don't know yet what phone will replace my Pixel 6a in the future. If I had to choose today, it wouldn't be a Pixel. Maybe Google will turn things around between now and the next time I'm shopping for a new phone, but I don't have high expectations.In case anyone at Google sees this and wants to look into things, here are my orders that were canceled: GS.7946-4132-7374; GS.7946-7127-2293; GS.7946-0122-0636; and my Support Case ID: 5-0719000032604.","164":"This post is just gonna be me gushing. Hard. I just really feel like Google has done something that no other company has. They are devoted to connecting you to the internet and making your life easier. They make huge amounts of money, but at their core they just make the internet more usable.Up until recently, Google was just a search engine for me., I used an iphone and had a macbook. I used firefox and it was okay. Over the past 18 months or so I have changed my entire view by so much. I realized how chrome was a very good browser so I used it instead. Then google stuff really invaded my phone. I just kept installing google things because it was so easy and useful. The best thing to my mind though was Google Now. It had great design elements, it had amazing functionality. I loved it. I had jailbroken my phone so I was able to make the default apps all google. I was slowly changing an iphone into an android phone. Then I switched to PC instead of my mac. The change there was very welcomed (I'm a gamer and I got into PC gaming about a year and a half ago). Then I started to install google apps all over the place on the comptuer as well. I had used google play music and backed up all my music on there so it was easy to transfer files to my new computer. Skip forward to the beginning of the summer. I got a microsoft surface pro 2. Rather than loading it up with all sorts of crap programs I got it jacked up with google stuff. Google play music, Chrome, drive. etc. Then about a month ago I accidentally dropped my iphone into the toilet. Kaput. I had been planning on making the switch to android for quite some time by this point (I was hoping for the google Ara to break my android-virginity). The main pull though was Google Now. I am a sucker for it because it just organizes everything for me and gives me relevant info when I need it. I had verizon so I ended up getting the HTC One M8 (I installed a google play edition rom on that thing right after). It was wonderful. Google had already backed up everything from that old phone making the switch a breeze. All my contacts, calendar, etc. Now I'm running along enjoying my android phone and its uses. Then I started reading about android wear more and more. I learned that it was pretty much Google Now on your wrist and fell in love. A friend of mine has a pebble so I was already aware of some of the uses of a smartwatch, but the voice control sealed the deal. Not only can I get my notifications on my wrist, but I can reply without even getting my phone out of my pocket. Yesterday I managed to order a Moto 360 from the Google Play store. I am ultra hyped. But google doesn't just make life easier with connecting you to the internet or between your other devices (Chrome remote desktop is spectacular at that :P), but they are now making devices which are novel and have real applications. The android wear for example, a smartwatch that isn't just an extension of your phone, but able to control it as well. Or google glass, which still has a lot of room for improvement, but is a novel way of using technology. Google Ara, where they are sick of manufacturers like Samsung having free reign to do whatever they want, so they take the power away from them. Google Fiber, getting the middle man out of the way. Or their weather balloon internet\/ satellite internet (rumors? idk). The point is that Google has become so much more than a search engine to me and so recently. I was sick of apple and their awful design practices (Architecture Major here, so I know some things about design) and wanted some freedom to use things effectively. The most ironic to me was that icloud, apple's \"cloud service\" was complete shit when I didn't have my phone. I couldn't access anything that was backed up there without wiping the phone and restarting it or getting another apple phone. Meanwhile Google automatically backed up everything and made it incredibly easy to access. I'm glad that I am now truly getting a Google experience in my life, and man it is leagues better than any \"experience\" apple can play off. ","165":"Ok, it's nearly 2024, AI is set to take over the world, and Google STILL doesn't know how to make Android sufficiently customizable??? I just got a pixel 8 pro, and while I love the phone and all of the AI features baked in, they need to hire some Android developers with common sense.Here are a few big missing features that just boggle my mind.1. Ability to rearrange and\/or customize navigation buttons.Simple. USEFUL. So I would probably use gesture navigation, but it directly interferes with my pie control app, which is way too useful to get rid of...so I still use the navigation buttons on the bottom.Why force someone to root a phone to customize something SO BASIC when it should absolutely be customizable within stock Android?!?Thank God I found a navigation bar app on the Play store that overlays the old navigation bar, and it's completely customizable, because not being able to switch the recent button and back button was driving me crazy!2. More fine-tuned control over the display (White balance, saturation, contrast, gamma, etc)I'm not sure if this is specifically a Google issue or a Pixel issue, but it's absolutely maddening. These phones are primarily entertainment consumption devices, how the display looks is LITERALLY the most important thing, yet fine-tune customization, something that's been on television displays for decades (even the cheapest POS televisions), is absolutely and completely missing. How the f##k does this make any sense whatsoever??3. More fine-tuned text color options.This one is so silly...I had to giggle. How is there no option to select a black text on the lock screen? \ud83e\udd23 Furthermore, there should be an obvious option to select ANY color you want on a color wheel...seriously, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.There are a lot of other small things as well, but those are more nit picky and I won't waste anyone's time with that.4. Notification shade and status bar customization.Let me choose to have the notification shade be transparent or semi-transparent...or, let's get REALLY crazy and let me change the tint. I actually hate the way they've made it look on Android 14, It looks a lot better in all previous versions of Android.And I haven't found a way to take off the clock in the upper left corner of the status bar. The status bar itself should be 100% customizable...this is really insane.So there's my rant. Maybe by the year 2030, before the actual singularity with AI taking over the world, we'll be able to actually customize our phones... \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44","166":"After having the headphone Jack for so many years, its time to finally ditch the headphone jack 100% for good.

I was all in. It's been a great phone. The only problems I've had are the charge doesn't last quite as long as I would hope and an app that would play audio at random times when the phone wasn't in use (which was fixed relatively fast). Other than that it was the most reliable, easy to use phone I ever had and the photos are great. Like beyond great. This thing takes [amazing photos](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/pixel\/). Even in the long term reviews that have been trickling in this year people are saying it's the best smartphone they've ever used.---------------------**ffwd to the Pixel 2**When I heard about the Pixel 2 I was excited. Then came all the news; There's no SD card, the bezels are huge, it's not called \"Nexus,\" it's too expensive, there's no wireless charging, no dual cameras, there's no bixby button, it's plastic looking, WHERE'S THE HEAD PHONE JACK???I was pissed too. Especially about the headphone jack thing. What the fuck was Google doing. I like my Pixel, why didn't they just take that and make it better?Then I thought about it. *How many times had I used my headphone jack in the past year?* Twice. That's it. Two times. I used wireless headphones on the subway and my car connects through bluetooth.  Now people's situation may be different but was I really going to let a feature I used twice dictate my purchase?How about the lack of dual cameras. Google's claiming the [dual pixel thing](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/pixel-2-is-so-good-it-doesnt-need-dual-cameras-google-says\/) is as good as dual cameras and less clunky. The original Pixel's camera was the best available when it came out. I love what they have created before. I'll give it a shot.Still no wireless charging though. Even back in the day [I jerry-rigged my S3 to have wireless charging](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/this-easy-hack-adds-wireless-charging-to-samsung-galaxy-s3\/), why doesn't the Pixel 2 have it? The fast charging is great. I guess it would be nice to have fast **and** wireless charging but if I had to pick between the two it would be the fast charging hands down.Okay, but what about the *no micro SD card thing*. This is where I think Google is making a huge shift in the way we store stuff on our phone. Google photos has unlimited storage, I don't need an SD card for that. My music is all on Spotify. I can get another TB of storage on Google Drive for $99 if I really need it (that's like 8 micro 128 GB Micro USB cards, although it's not instant). I know all of these solutions require data. But in a pinch I can use my [USB flash key chain](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B015QJ0X1U\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).But that price is killer right? I'm not a fan of giant phones, they don't sit well in my hand so I'm looking at getting the regular version. 64 GB is enough memory. So I'm paying $649. A little steep but the new ~~iPhone 8s~~ iPhone X is $999. It's not even close. Also, Google is buying back my used Pixel for $350. So in the end I'm upgrading my phone to a flagship Android device that I've loved the previous generation of for $299._______________________Hate on it as much as you want but the Pixel 2 is going to work. Google here is trying to create something that makes using a phone simpler and more reliable. There might be things that are inconvenient to get used to but overall I think it's going make using a phone less of a hassle and more intuitive. In a time where both Samsung and Apple's last flagship phones had issues with smoking and literal explosions I don't mind sticking with Google, even if that means I can't use the headphone jack twice a year.","168":"I have been loyal to Google for about 20 years now: starting from search, Gmail, web based applications, Google docs, Android cell phones (Nexus and pixel), ChromeOS, Chromecast, Google home devices and Nest thermostat... You name them. I almost got them all.After today's conference, I never been least excited about the product through my whole journey with them: They keep introducing confusing names changes and new products without improving the features of the older ones: Google home is now called Nest which is different from the thermostat. Google docs was changed several names (Drive then One... I can't keep up with the name changes) but I haven't seen significant change in the features. I have 3 Chromecast ( chrome cast gen 1, 2, and audio), and I'm not sure anymore which one can play stadia (I think there is another newer one).I used to go against Microsoft because they were focusing on the tiny shiny things but not the quality. Ironically I'm seeing the opposite now and I'm more Microsoft Office fan.Is it just me (maybe getting older and less excited about such technology) or Google, and tech companies in general, are losing creativity?I still love you Google, but I don't feel the same love back from you anymore \ud83d\ude2d","169":"Having spent a couple days using my new Chromebook, I\u2019ve developed some initial thoughts.  The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:**Hardware:** Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring \u201cthump\u201d rather than a plasticy \u201cslap\u201d.  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.  **Keyboard:** I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I\u2019d enjoy \u201chome\u201d and \u201cend\u201d buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google\u2019s 2 year cloud storage service) **Screen:** The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.**Camera:** The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven\u2019t tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s fine.**Speakers:** can get very loud and sound good on hard surfaces**Ports:** the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven\u2019t tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.**Computation:** ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can\u2019t help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I\u2019ve managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.**Chrome OS:** The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I\u2019ve seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn\u2019t much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren\u2019t yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn\u2019t yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google\u2019s update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.**Apps:** I haven\u2019t played with these too much but I\u2019ve found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn\u2019t supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven\u2019t turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won\u2019t work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I\u2019ll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.  **Extras:** 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn\u2019t have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I\u2019m pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn\u2019t a \u201cfull computer\u201d, the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I\u2019m happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I\u2019m happy to be in \u201cwork\u201d mode on my Chromebook.  When it\u2019s time to play, I\u2019ll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.  Less is more; Chrome OS is my 5th screen.  ","170":"Buckle up, it's a long one.I've been a Google fan for a long time - I've owned most of the Nexus line, I use basically all Google's cloud services, Play suite, etc. And generally I absolutely love the Google experience, with only one major exception - Play Music. Never before have I used software that is so fundamentally broken at performing the most basic functions. It's so bad that I literally cannot listen to music on it, it's like it fights me every step of the way. Let me start by walking you through my experience with it just 5 minutes ago which is honestly astoundingly bad:Decided I wanted to listen to some music on my speakers, which are connected to a Chromecast Audio (pretty reasonable request, right?). I pull up the Play Music app, connect it to my Chromecast, hit shuffle on a playlist I want to hear. The first song starts to play, and I quickly flick through the playlist and swipe away songs I don't want right now. Suddenly the songs appear back in the list. I swipe them away again, and the music stops playing. I look and notice I've been disconnected from the Chromecast. I reconnect. It disconnects me. I reconnect again, and again it disconnects me. Maybe it's the Chromecast, so I decide to unplug it and plug it back in to allow it to reboot. In the meantime, I notice the songs I've now swiped away twice are back in the playlist. I swipe them away again, and attempt to connect to my Chromecast once more. It disconnects me straight away. I try casting a podcast to my Chromecast from Pocket Casts to see if it's GPM or my Chromecast - the podcast plays without a problem. So I force stop the GPM app to see if that fixes the problem. Reopen the app, connect to Chromecast and select an album. The first song sits buffering for a good 10 seconds, then GPM decides to nope the fuck outta there and starts playing the second song. I wanted to hear the first one, so I tap on that again in the queue. Again, buffers for maybe 10 seconds then skips, this time to the third song. I decide it's probably not playing nice with the Chromecast, so instead I plug my phone into the speakers via aux to simplify the setup. Hit on a song I want to hear, and get the message \"This song cannot be played\". Try many other songs and get the same error for probably 80% of them. Try to shuffle my playlist again, and it clearly can't play any of the songs and skips to around halfway down the playlist and starts playing a random song in the middle, skipping probably 30 or so songs before it. Then, suddenly, the app crashes and Android tells me to force close it. I try again to play some music after restarting the app, and it suddenly just stops again. I hit play, and it starts buffering all over again, then jumps back to the start of the song! Gets maybe 30 seconds in, and skips to the next song. At this point I gave up and started playing music via YouTube.I tried for around 20 minutes to play some music, and I quite literally couldn't. Yes that's right, the app is so buggy that it can't play music. I'll give that a moment to sink in. And this isn't a one off - regularly when I try to play music, I get the error saying that song can't be played. I would say I get it around 80% of the time I try to play some music, so it's not like it's an infrequent thing. And it happens on mobile data as well as WiFi (both my WiFi and other WiFi networks) so it's clearly not my network.Aside from the fact it can't play music most of the time for me, the app itself is sluggish and slow. It frequently lags and stutters on my Pixel XL, and if I have a lot of songs in the queue it gets even worse. Swiping songs out of the queue usually doesn't work and they just reappear, and for the last week or so, I can't get the app to appear in my recents. Even if I press the overview\/recents button whilst inside GPM, the recents list opens and GPM is nowhere to be seen, so multitasking with it is impossible.Furthermore, many of the artist listings are completely wrong. Eco, a New York trance artist, has had his artist page merged with a metal band called Eco. Other artists have about 50 different artist listings for all their collaboration songs. For example, 'Beauville & NoMBe' and 'NoMBe & Sonny Alven' are both separate artist listings to 'NoMBe'. Any variation in artist is treated as being a separate artist, so \"Artist X\", \"Artist X feat. Y\", \"Artist X feat. Z\" will all be treated as being individual artists, with three separate GPM listings, making it extremely hard to find a song you're looking for.Speaking of finding songs you're looking for, search is ATROCIOUS. Instead of any kind of intelligent ordering of search results based on what's in your library or what kind of music you listen to, you instead get a clusterfuck of artists and songs with that word in. Example: if I have a song called 'Come Down' in my library, and I try to search for it, I have to trawl through a load of artists, albums and songs with those words in which are not even close to my music taste. And I have the song I'm looking for in my library, yet it doesn't get floated to the top of the results?I'm Feeling Lucky is awful. It's like GPM hasn't paid any attention to the kind of music I've been listening to for the past two years. Around 3 years ago I used to really like trance, but gradually shifted to more mellow indie rock. Probably around 50% of the time, I'm Feeling Lucky plays me a trance-based radio, even though I haven't played any trance in around 3 years. I even went as far as to go through my library, thumbs DOWN every trance song I'd previously given a thumbs up, as well as remove it from my library, and go into settings and delete my listening data, yet it STILL plays trance music in my random playlist.I'm not going to go into the UI or the icon (seriously though, that icon in the white circle on the Pixel looks awful) simply because that's a topic that gets covered a lot in this subreddit, but needless to say it's lacking in that department as well. And reordering the queue whilst playing music - holy shit. Trying to slide songs around in the queue with those fiddly little dots, or trying to click the overflow menu (e.g. to add to playlist, go to artist, etc) more often than not results in accidentally clicking that song in the queue, either causing the music to jump to that song or, if that song is already playing, causing it to restart. This is downright humiliating when you're DJing at a party and the music keeps stopping or skipping because your thumb was half a millimetre to the left of your intended touch target.Navigation seriously sucks. If I'm on an album and I want to go to the artist, there's no option for that in the large overflow menu. The only way to go to the artist page is either to back out of everything and search for them, or to hit the tiny overflow menu by one of the songs in the album, and only there does it have the option to go to artist or go to album. And if I've added one song from an album, and do a search for that album, it'll often take me to an album page with only the songs I've added. I then have to back out and click on another entry for the album to get the one with all the tracks - there's no distinction between the songs of the album in your library and the full album in search results. Furthermore, if I've added one song from an album, then go to that album and click to add the rest of the album to my library, the one song on that album already in my library gets REMOVED. For example, imagine an album has 3 songs in it, and I have song 2 in my library already, then click on the album overflow menu to add the rest of the album to my library. If I now go into that album in my library, I have song 1 and song 3, but NOT song 2. Adding the whole album removes songs from that album which you already had in your library.TL;DR Google Play Music is, in every way, the WORST software experience I've had. It's incapable of the basics, like playing music and sorting playlists. Its UI is awful, navigation is inconsistent, it's buggy, laggy and doesn't appear in recents. Luckily I get GPM through a family plan which my parents pay for, because there's no way I would be willing to pay my own money for this.","171":"**Background**  In June, Anker's newly-founded smart audio brand [Zolo](https:\/\/zoloaudio.com\/) announced their first wireless earbuds on [Kickstarter](https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1792059063\/liberty-the-first-zero-compromise-total-wireless-e\/description), including support for all three major assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant). However, after successful funding, they removed almost all traces of Google Assistant. Compare the current campaign page and website to archived versions, and you'll note how the only mention of Google Assistant remaining is in the promo video (which is really hard to replace on Kickstarter). In the last days, they have also removed support for Alexa from their website.However, when asked about it in comments and on social media, they state that there were no issues regarding Google Assistant, and that we should stay tuned for updates. **Anker & Google?**  Now, at IFA, [Zolo and Google annonced Mojo](https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/assistant\/your-google-assistant-is-coming-to-new-speakers-and-more\/), one of the first third-party speakers with Google Assistant. A blogpost on Zolo's blog was posted and then taken down again a few days later, as was the [product page for Mojo](https:\/\/zoloaudio.com\/pages\/mojo) (also linked in the Google blog post). Something's going on.**The theory**  After Anker launched their Kickstarter campaign, Google may have contacted them about the Bisto program. As launch was (as is still) slated for October 2017, the lower-cost Zolo Liberty earbuds would make great launch devices for the Bisto program alongside the higher-priced Quiet Comfort II and the new Pixels, also slated for an October launch. Anker agreed and started working on implementing bisto to their hardware, removing earlier mentions of Assistant to keep this a secret. To comply with some sort of bisto guidelines, they have now also removed their standalone Alexa support from the headphones, putting the Liberty+ on par with the Quiet Comfort II.We're pretty sure more there will be multiple Bisto headphones, and the recent leaks of Bose's QC2 have made it clear that [Google won't be building them themselves](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/2017\/09\/06\/google-app-v7-11-beta-suggests-next-android-version-8-1-adds-battery-levels-bisto-headphones-prepares-tweak-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown\/). Besides, it would very much make sense to have some sort wireless earbuds in the bisto family at launch to counter Samsung's IconX and of course Apple's AirPods, given the new Pixels will likely not have a headphone jack.What's your take on this?","172":"I have Google Apps accounts for everyone in our family.  When Google announced the new Family Plan for Google Play Music, I was stoked.  Both my kids love music, and this would be a great way for them to create playlists that they could share with me so I can play their favorite music in the car when taking them to school or running errands.  I went to sign up for it, only to discover that Google Apps accounts are not supported.  My pie in the sky was thrown to the ground.We use our Google accounts for lots of things.  Gmail, YouTube, Photos, Drive, Chrome syncing, and more.  My wife and I have Android phones, and my wife and kids all have Android tablets.  We're pretty well locked in to the Google ecosystem, and it's been working out great, until now.Since we are unable to use our Google Apps accounts on the new Family Plan, I decided that I would abandon Google Apps and just switch us all to regular Gmail accounts.  Gmail users seem to get new features long, long before Google Apps accounts, and I always feel like a second class citizen.  It was time.  I signed up for all new Gmail accounts for everyone.  The accounts required many numbers in the address because everyone has Gmail at this point and all the good names are taken.  Next up was setting up Google Music with the new accounts to get them on the Family Plan.I started with my daughter's tablet.  I setup the new account, showed her how to make playlists in Google Music, and she was happy.  Later that day, her tablet died and she wanted to play some Minecraft.  I told her she could listen to her playlist on her computer while she played, which she thought was pretty cool.  Of course, I had to login using an Incognito window in Chrome, because right now she's syncing everything with her GApps account.  Ugh, fine.  I teach her how to do this and tell her why it must be done that way.Next up was my son.  He's way into YouTube.  He has his own channel with a little under 200 subscribers.  It's not big time, but big enough that he dedicates a substantial portion of his free time making videos for it.  He loves it.  I tell him that our account comes with YouTube Red, which lets him watch YouTube videos without ads, and lets him play just the audio in the car from his favorite videos.  He's pretty excited.  I look up how to change your associated Google Account on YouTube to a different one so we can use his new Gmail account.  If you didn't link your YouTube account with Google+, you can easily switch it.  If you did, well \"check back later\" because it doesn't support the ability to do that right now.  You can add a manager to your Google+ page, but if you want to break that link completely, you have to delete your whole channel.  As if anyone would ever do that.  Fine, let's go with another Incognito window for my son too!  I show him how to do this and tell him why.  None of the videos he watches will sync with his History from his other account, and of course he has to resubscribe to all his favorite channels.  Lastly, I tell him to create a YouTube playlist of all his favorite music so that we can listen to it in the car in the YouTube Music app on the way to school tomorrow.So, the morning routine for us is to take my daughter to school and let her pick what we listen to, drop her off, then let my son pick what to listen to until I drop him off.  I sign into my daughter's new Google account on my phone so I can access her playlist she made.  When I switch to it, it tells me that all my local music has to be deleted when switching accounts.  **You have got to be kidding me.**  Fine, delete my several GB worth of music, I'll just redownload it every night to my phone, because I have time for that... \/s  I say fine, switch the account, download her playlist to the phone and we're off.  We listen to the latest Cameron Dove and Katy Perry songs and life is good.Up next, YouTube Music.  My son made a sweet Megaman playlist on YouTube with tons of remixes.  He said it took him about 2 hours.  I sign in with my son's new Google account on my phone so I can play his playlist.  YouTube Music doesn't even support playlists.  **You have got to be kidding me.**  What the hell is the point of YouTube Music then?!  If I wanted radio I'd just use Google Music for that!  Pointless app.  My son is as astonished as I am.  Fine, we switch back to my Google Music account.  Oh right, now we have to delete all the music I just downloaded for my daughter.  Ugh.  I do that, and now I have to stream the Super Meat Boy soundtrack on the way to my son's school because I don't want to download a whole album over my data connection.  Our connection is a bit spotty, so we have to listen to a lot of skipping and just a generally terrible music experience.I am just flabergasted at what a horrible experience this Family Plan has been.  If Google had just released the Family Plan to Google Apps accounts in the first place--you know, the ones that they advertised for families a few years ago--this would have been a complete non-issue (except for YouTube Music being worthless).  Now my kids have to deal with two separate accounts on their tablets and in Chrome on their PCs, and I'm not even going to bother setting my wife up with a second account because I don't need the added stress.  It was hard enough getting her to use a password manager.  I'm just so disappointed in this entire experience.","173":"https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/1ctg5xa\/video\/z77timxf8t0d1\/player**\\[Personally recommended topics to search\\]*** Project Astra* Starline**\\[Highlights\\]**1.

Google mentioned \"Gemini\" more often than \"AI\" this time.(Sundar Pichai mentioned AI 121 times.)2. Google is focusing on integrating Gemini Multimodality across all areas, covering both recognition and generation of video, audio, and text.3. Increasing Gemini's token size seems aimed at detailed personalized info and integrated services. This was clear in Project Astra with real-time Gemini Pro integration and Context Caching, which saves costs and speeds up processing. - Comparing Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s GPT: - Both have significant multimodal achievements. OpenAI leads in generative capabilities, while Google excels in token range. OpenAI has better API integration, but Google is superior in on-device integration. - OpenAI's massive model has high reasoning abilities, but Google's strategy includes:3-1. On-device capabilities (Nano in Android OS, circle image search on Samsung phones, PaliGemma). Google\u2019s mobile OS and partnerships give it an edge.3-2. Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Email, Photos). Examples include organizing receipts in Drive and Sheets or Google Photos creating albums based on specific moments, showing the large model\u2019s business applications.3-3. As a search engine company, Google is developing technology to verify data with search engine data to prevent hallucinations, giving it a competitive edge.4. The realtime capability of the multimodal model was surprising. I used the Project Astra demo; multimodal audio recognition was accurate and real-time, with seamless interrupt handling. The process wasn\u2019t in sync but handled with low latency, showing significant improvements in usability for voice interfaces and multimodal models.5. The main takeaway from this I\/O was that multimodal models can be responsive enough for actual products and are currently available.6. Examples were provided of how Gemini can integrate into Chrome, Search, Android Mobile, and Google Workspace to enhance user convenience. (\"Here's an example\" was a common phrase.) Integrating these elements with multimodal capabilities could significantly change everyday life. I have a Gemini Office Hour with a Googler tomorrow, full of questions about Gemini\u2019s multimodal latency. Until 2 PM during this event, I didn't hear keywords like TensorFlow\/Jax, and there was little talk about the Cloud. Vertex AI was mentioned occasionally with Gemini, and the rest was about TPU 6th generation.7. The core question was whether multimodal models could positively impact our lives. Even now, there are no significant use cases beyond chatbots. Who will make this a reality? This has been my interest, and at this I\/O, I saw numerous examples. If Google had integrated chat and document apps, we\u2019d spend most of our time with Gemini. For code, it seems to be entering with Project IDX, sharing portions of the IDE.","174":"I originally posted in r\/googlepay given what caused me to write this, but it was suggested to me that I share it here too. In my defiant frustration with this behemoth of a company I\u2019m doing so.&lt;rant&gt;I used to be a Google and Android user and even somewhat of a fan. Oh how times have changed. Sure Android devices generally cost less and often see more cutting edge features than their fruit alternatives, but I truly feel a rather steep price is paid with the difficulty and occasional impossibility of maintaining any semblance of digital privacy in the Googleverse. In 2015 I got an iPhone mainly for this reason and never once looked back...and will indeed never go back. Sure Google makes fairly good and often innovative products but the hidden price of \u201cfree\u201d for most of it has become entirely too high for me.Nonetheless, there are certain situations where I will accept trading off and using this company\u2019s services, and one in particular where I\u2019m forced to if I want to have any semblance of a complete modern internet existence. There is zero viable alternative to YouTube. None. The towel was already thrown in for me there.Google Voice is also a very unique service that doesn\u2019t have a check all the boxes alternative. I used this all the time when I lived overseas for a bit to talk to people back in the US without paying an arm and a leg, or in fact anything, to do it. They probably have some sort of activity tracking or maybe even conversation recording\/analyzing tech there too, but hey at the time the potential data collection and analysis was an acceptable trade off for the no cost calls home they provided that I constantly made use of with a foreign SIM\u2019s cellular data, again through an iPhone. Call me paranoid all you want, I don\u2019t trust these tech giants as far as I could kick their glitzy HQ buildings like soccer balls around Silicon Valley. Which is none. You shouldn\u2019t either.My main point of the keyboard mashing fest happening right now is that Google Pay was far and away the biggest example where I was absolutely fine and in fact happy with trading my data for their services. I used Google Pay constantly as an Apple user for the absolute singular reason that they had zero instant transfer fee to a debit card. I curiously looked at their new app release and stumbled across the new policy with their so called \u201cimproved\u201d revamp, they will be generously matching Square Cash with a 1.5% instant transfer fee if you so much as touch the new app. Square Cash has the highest fee in the industry that I know of by the way. I guess Google felt some sort of insane need to go from zero fee to getting outdone by frickin PayPal in this area. I don\u2019t know of anyone else anywhere that has a free instant transfer offering, but I will surely be doing some research shortly that will more than likely unfortunately end in futility. Essentially all of the other companies in this space have vastly different business models than Google therefore they charge fees to get your money this way. Different revenue stream. Again, a situation I was totally cool with trading a slight wade into that bag of worms to avoid paying out of my pocket. I guess so much for that.Google is one of the central companies in the world that operate with the model of your use of their products and those products using you meshing to incredible levels, right up there with Facebook. Now they still continue to want to analyze you down to the point of every single thing you click on or action you perform anywhere on the internet, and oh by the way they\u2019re going to start introducing some \u201csmall\u201d fees for the privilege of partaking in this instantaneously meshed reality. Yeah, no. I\u2019m out. I sure as hell will not be touching that \u201cgreat new\u201d app with a ten foot pole and when the old app and platform ceases to work, my slow walk away from most Google services will turn into an all out sprint. My Gmail accounts have held on for daily use until now simply because of the hugely arduous task of changing your email with every single service and company you do business with. I had already opened some new email accounts elsewhere to attempt an escape from Google\u2019s AI machine beast that likely monitors and analyzes intricate details of my life that exist in the modern inbox even though I personally specifically tell it not to. They can be 100% sure I\u2019m gonna be very shortly sucking it up, buckling down, and hammering through a transition to turn those accounts into glorified spam boxes now.I have mostly used Google Maps until now too, because I like the interface marginally better and when I lived in a few major cities I found the transit info to be very superior. I\u2019ll leave it installed for if that comes up, but I now live in a place where I have to drive everywhere. Apple Maps is fine for that. Again, adios.Drive, just gotta do a download dump of what\u2019s in there from long ago and wipe it. iCloud is unfortunately necessary in Appleland so I use it for most small to medium size files too now because why not.Chrome, haha good one. Been mostly using Safari which is perfectly adequate and fast, occasionally loading up Firefox particularly for PC browsing. Yeah I know Firefox isn\u2019t amazing but Mozilla consistently continues to make strides in improving it, not to mention their organization\u2019s mission about a more free, fair, and open internet being very noble, if a bit utopian. You wouldn\u2019t catch me dead using Chrome for personal use in 2020. It\u2019s functional and quick yes, but do an honest cost\/benefit analysis for using it daily and you\u2019ll probably see that the cost in the expansion of your digital footprint is heavily weighted in favor of benefiting Google. Also before anyone says, \u201cChrome is just too good to give up, have you even used it lately?\u201d I actually use it daily at work. It is a very good browser functionally made by a company in the business of collecting as much data on as many details as possible about everyone, to do with essentially whatever they see fit. Now tell me, does it sound like a super good idea to route your entire world (pretty much literally with covid going on causing even more astounding amounts of things happening online) through a web browser made by a company who has that as their central business plan? Hell Microsoft is very far from a saint of a company but at least their sole purpose in life is not to collect a massive trove of everything about you. If on PC, Edge is actually worth considering now, it didn\u2019t used to be but hey hey, it\u2019s now Chromium based ;)And the big kahuna, search, I\u2019ve already been using DuckDuckGo for years. Yeah I know it\u2019s not as intuitive but it\u2019s a trade off I was and am still fully willing to accept for not giving this data hoarding company a consistent unfiltered window into my mind.So some would call this transfer fee addition to Google Pay a minor change, but given my existing mounting frustration with Google and my extensive use of the service specifically to avoid these types of fees, it is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me. Goodbye and good riddance Google. I will be kicking you out of my life in every way realistically possible going forward.&lt;\/rant&gt;","175":"Ever since the introduction of Google Search in 1997, the worldwide market share of all search engines has been rather lopsided. Google has dominated the search engine market, maintaining an 92.47 percent market share as of June 2021. The majority of Google revenues are generated through advertising. The company has also expanded its services to mail, productivity tools, enterprise products, mobile devices and other ventures. As a result, Google earned one of the highest tech company revenues in 2020 with roughly 181.69 billion U.S. dollars.How Much Data Is Created Every Day in 2021?In 2020, people created 1.7 MB of data every second.By 2022, 70% of the globe\u2019s GDP will have undergone digitization.In 2021, 68% of Instagram users view photos from brands. By 2025, 200+ zettabytes of data will be in cloud storage around the globe.In 2020, users sent around 500,000 Tweets per day. By the end of 2020, 44 zettabytes will make up the entire digital universe.Every day, 306.4 billion emails are sent, and 500 million Tweets are made.How Much Data Do We Use?A lot.And now, time to wrap up\u2026 Kidding, kidding.Given how much data is on the internet, the actual amount of data used is difficult to calculate. But if we\u2019re talking about how much data is created every day the current estimate stands at 1.145 trillion MB per day. That\u2019s not all.1. On average, every human created at least 1.7 MB of data per second in 2020. (Source: Domo)Why 1.7 MB? Our next statistic will give it more perspective. Come along with me\u20262. We created 2.5 quintillion data bytes daily in 2020.(Source: Domo)If you\u2019re wondering how much data the average person uses per month, you can start by looking at how much data people created every day in 2020 on average.

Just FYI.3. 463 exabytes of data will be generated each day by people as of 2025.(Source: Raconteur)Based on how much data is already generated every day by humans through social media, video sharing, and communications, the number will surely increase.4. There were 4.66 billion active internet users around the world in January 2021.(Source: Statista)Internet growth statistics from Statista show that 4.66 billion people are using the internet as of January 2021. That\u2019s close to 60% of the world population.That\u2019s staggering growth, bearing in mind that there were only 2.6 billion internet users in 2013.It looks like mobile phones were more popular than other devices, with 4.28 billion unique users. With mobile-friendliness being a top feature for most sites today, that makes a lot of sense.By the way, do you have any idea how many websites there are? Here\u2019s the answer.5. There were 319 million new internet users in 2020.(Source: Data Reportal)According to the growth of the internet statistics, 300+ million new users joined the internet in 2020.

Here\u2019s some insight into the popular platforms of Facebook and Twitter.Video Growth StatisticsVideo growth statistics tell us that YouTube, Twitch, and Snapchat tend to be the most popular social platforms for video sharing. What is interesting though is the difference in data they individually use.11. A 480p video on YouTube uses 8.3MB per minute and 500MB per hour.(Source: WhistleOut)\u2018How much data does a YouTube video use?\u2019 is a fairly common question.It largely depends on the quality of the video being played. 480p is the standard definition, however, higher quality settings like 1080p will inevitably use more data.12. A 480p video on Twitch uses between 0.405GB and 0.54GB per hour.(Source: Stream Scheme)Although this may not seem much (and really, it isn\u2019t), the truth is that it is more than other platforms like YouTube and Snapchat.13. You need 1MB to send one Snapchat.(Source: Canstarblue)If you want to find out how much data Snapchat uses, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no public data relating available. However, it\u2019s estimated that one Snapchat costs 1MB to send.Remember that you\u2019ll need more than that for high-definition pictures, videos, or Snapchats with filters.Big Data Growth StatisticsData growth stats in 2021 tell us that big data is growing at an unprecedented rate.

Never before have I used software that is so fundamentally broken at performing the most basic functions. It's so bad that I literally cannot listen to music on it, it's like it fights me every step of the way. Let me start by walking you through my experience with it just 5 minutes ago which is honestly astoundingly bad:Decided I wanted to listen to some music on my speakers, which are connected to a Chromecast Audio (pretty reasonable request, right?). I pull up the Play Music app, connect it to my Chromecast, hit shuffle on a playlist I want to hear. The first song starts to play, and I quickly flick through the playlist and swipe away songs I don't want right now. Suddenly the songs appear back in the list. I swipe them away again, and the music stops playing. I look and notice I've been disconnected from the Chromecast. I reconnect. It disconnects me. I reconnect again, and again it disconnects me. Maybe it's the Chromecast, so I decide to unplug it and plug it back in to allow it to reboot. In the meantime, I notice the songs I've now swiped away twice are back in the playlist. I swipe them away again, and attempt to connect to my Chromecast once more. It disconnects me straight away. I try casting a podcast to my Chromecast from Pocket Casts to see if it's GPM or my Chromecast - the podcast plays without a problem. So I force stop the GPM app to see if that fixes the problem. Reopen the app, connect to Chromecast and select an album. The first song sits buffering for a good 10 seconds, then GPM decides to nope the fuck outta there and starts playing the second song. I wanted to hear the first one, so I tap on that again in the queue. Again, buffers for maybe 10 seconds then skips, this time to the third song. I decide it's probably not playing nice with the Chromecast, so instead I plug my phone into the speakers via aux to simplify the setup. Hit on a song I want to hear, and get the message \"This song cannot be played\". Try many other songs and get the same error for probably 80% of them. Try to shuffle my playlist again, and it clearly can't play any of the songs and skips to around halfway down the playlist and starts playing a random song in the middle, skipping probably 30 or so songs before it. Then, suddenly, the app crashes and Android tells me to force close it. I try again to play some music after restarting the app, and it suddenly just stops again. I hit play, and it starts buffering all over again, then jumps back to the start of the song! Gets maybe 30 seconds in, and skips to the next song. At this point I gave up and started playing music via YouTube.I tried for around 20 minutes to play some music, and I quite literally couldn't. Yes that's right, the app is so buggy that it can't play music. I'll give that a moment to sink in. And this isn't a one off - regularly when I try to play music, I get the error saying that song can't be played. I would say I get it around 80% of the time I try to play some music, so it's not like it's an infrequent thing. And it happens on mobile data as well as WiFi (both my WiFi and other WiFi networks) so it's clearly not my network.Aside from the fact it can't play music most of the time for me, the app itself is sluggish and slow. It frequently lags and stutters on my Pixel XL, and if I have a lot of songs in the queue it gets even worse. Swiping songs out of the queue usually doesn't work and they just reappear, and for the last week or so, I can't get the app to appear in my recents. Even if I press the overview\/recents button whilst inside GPM, the recents list opens and GPM is nowhere to be seen, so multitasking with it is impossible.Furthermore, many of the artist listings are completely wrong. Eco, a New York trance artist, has had his artist page merged with a metal band called Eco. Other artists have about 50 different artist listings for all their collaboration songs. For example, 'Beauville & NoMBe' and 'NoMBe & Sonny Alven' are both separate artist listings to 'NoMBe'. Any variation in artist is treated as being a separate artist, so \"Artist X\", \"Artist X feat. Y\", \"Artist X feat. Z\" will all be treated as being individual artists, with three separate GPM listings, making it extremely hard to find a song you're looking for.Speaking of finding songs you're looking for, search is ATROCIOUS. Instead of any kind of intelligent ordering of search results based on what's in your library or what kind of music you listen to, you instead get a clusterfuck of artists and songs with that word in. Example: if I have a song called 'Come Down' in my library, and I try to search for it, I have to trawl through a load of artists, albums and songs with those words in which are not even close to my music taste. And I have the song I'm looking for in my library, yet it doesn't get floated to the top of the results?I'm Feeling Lucky is awful. It's like GPM hasn't paid any attention to the kind of music I've been listening to for the past two years. Around 3 years ago I used to really like trance, but gradually shifted to more mellow indie rock. Probably around 50% of the time, I'm Feeling Lucky plays me a trance-based radio, even though I haven't played any trance in around 3 years. I even went as far as to go through my library, thumbs DOWN every trance song I'd previously given a thumbs up, as well as remove it from my library, and go into settings and delete my listening data, yet it STILL plays trance music in my random playlist.I'm not going to go into the UI or the icon (seriously though, that icon in the white circle on the Pixel looks awful) simply because that's a topic that gets covered a lot in this subreddit, but needless to say it's lacking in that department as well. And reordering the queue whilst playing music - holy shit. Trying to slide songs around in the queue with those fiddly little dots, or trying to click the overflow menu (e.g. to add to playlist, go to artist, etc) more often than not results in accidentally clicking that song in the queue, either causing the music to jump to that song or, if that song is already playing, causing it to restart. This is downright humiliating when you're DJing at a party and the music keeps stopping or skipping because your thumb was half a millimetre to the left of your intended touch target.Navigation seriously sucks. If I'm on an album and I want to go to the artist, there's no option for that in the large overflow menu. The only way to go to the artist page is either to back out of everything and search for them, or to hit the tiny overflow menu by one of the songs in the album, and only there does it have the option to go to artist or go to album. And if I've added one song from an album, and do a search for that album, it'll often take me to an album page with only the songs I've added. I then have to back out and click on another entry for the album to get the one with all the tracks - there's no distinction between the songs of the album in your library and the full album in search results. Furthermore, if I've added one song from an album, then go to that album and click to add the rest of the album to my library, the one song on that album already in my library gets REMOVED. For example, imagine an album has 3 songs in it, and I have song 2 in my library already, then click on the album overflow menu to add the rest of the album to my library. If I now go into that album in my library, I have song 1 and song 3, but NOT song 2. Adding the whole album removes songs from that album which you already had in your library.TL;DR Google Play Music is, in every way, the WORST software experience I've had. It's incapable of the basics, like playing music and sorting playlists. Its UI is awful, navigation is inconsistent, it's buggy, laggy and doesn't appear in recents. Luckily I get GPM through a family plan which my parents pay for, because there's no way I would be willing to pay my own money for this.","177":"After almost losing all of my data when my hard drive died, I decided to start backing up my photos with Google Drive, especially since they just made it so cheap. I just want a simple way to mirror the two libraries while being able to access them via G+ Photos AND Google Drive. I've realized there is no ideal way to do this without incurring a lot of extra work. I have ~8 gigs of photos all meticulously arranged into dated folders based on when they were taken, ie. \"Prom 2005\", \"College Graduation 2012\", \"Trip to Pittsburgh 2013\", etc. and I want to maintain that folder structure.I could put just move the My Pictures folder over to Google Drive and let it upload everything. This would keep my folders, but becomes a pain when adding new pictures. You can make it so pictures on the Drive folder appear in G+ Photos, but when G+ automatically backs up pictures my phone, but those pictures go directly to G+, not to Drive. I would have to manually download my pictures from G+ then RE-upload them to Drive.I could use Picasa's built in sync feature, but it's pretty lackluster, and I'm not a fan of Picasa whatsoever. Each album requires manually toggling the sync to G+, and any albums I want to pull from G+ to my laptop are placed in a \"Downloaded Albums\" folder and any deletions or categorizing would still need to be done locally and then a second time in the cloud, and I would much prefer my local photo library and cloud photo library to mirror one another.Finally Picasa also installs a secondary G+ Auto-Backup desktop application, which does almost the same thing yet is a separate program entirely. I had hoped this would be the solution I was looking for as I could just let it run quietly in the background pointed at my My Pictures folder, except that it's only a one way sync, doesn't add photos to Drive, and doesn't upload photos in any kind of folder structure, which makes it the worst option in my opinion.From the looks of it there is no convenient way to backup my library without the use of a 3rd party application. I had seen FolderSync suggested in this regard. Has anyone out there found a happy medium between all of these options? Has Google stated they plan better integration in the future? It seems preposterous that G+ Photos and Drive share the same cloud storage yet are so difficult to connect.","178":"First off, I've been meaning to write this for some time now, and with the sudden break of today's news, I figured now was as good a time as any, because I hope it is the beginning of change. I absolutely love Google, and Android, I would definitely identify myself and a Google\/Android fan boy. I work in a Verizon store, and love it because I get paid to evangelize to all of my customers what wonderful things Google and its OS have to offer. Alas in my doings, I have slowly but surely come to develop a major issue with Google and how they run things. Second, Apple, I don't like them, but I will give them credit where credit is due. Being the oldest mobile OS, that is also closed source, it has given Apple time and experience to take control over everything the user experiences to give each person the experience Apple designed. They do a damn good job at it. They update their OS periodically on their schedule, not manufacturers or carriers, when they update they do a beautiful job at telling their customers what they're adding. The take the time and efforts to reach out to their customers and tell them new features that are being added with every major release, usually by sticking it the activation process (i.e. Siri and Find My Phone). They also do a great job and associating their mobile OS with their other services, iTunes, iCloud, etc. Consumers have to pay for these services, and most are fine with that, they get their games, apps, music, and backup, and Apple makes a profit. A win-win.Google, having a very different business model has had some major issues with this the first few years. The OS was rough, and getting patches, updates and fixes to the consumers in a timely manner was net to impossible. Manufactures had to tweak and test to make sure the updates fit with their code, then the carriers had to mess with things, the whole process took months, assuming that XYZ phone was even going to get anything. Then May 2013 happened, and with it came Google Play Services, the silent updater that could swiftly fix, update, patch, and give the bird to manufacturers and carriers alike, all without the consumer being any wiser. Along that same time period Google also began separating key parts of the OS into apps that were update-able through the play store. It all but fixed the fragmentation issue, and put the control of Android, (mostly) back into the hands of Google.Today, Google has a vast plethora of services all designed to both serve the consumer, and give Google plenty of user data to analyze for its marketing and advertising. Therefore its consumers get these services (mostly) for free. Another win-win. Third, my beef\/issue\/question for Google (if any of you reading this are Google employees, please chime in). Google's own marketing sucks. It practically doesn't exist. Whats the point of having to many services if you don't tell your consumer base about them. (This part basically excludes everyone reading this). When an iPhone user wants music they go to iTunes, and spend a bunch of money to get said music. Most iPhone users knows about Find my Phone, the Sticky Notes app that syncs with iCloud, Siri, Apple Maps, Facetime, email, and syncing contacts, and apps across devices all through iCloud. When I sell an android phone to almost 9\/10 of my customers, I get any combination of the following questions (in no particular order):1) Can this do music? How to I get my music on this? Is there a way to get new music on this?    2) Does this have maps?3) Does this have Facetime\/ iMessage?4) Does this have Siri?5) Will this do my email?6) Does this have apps?7) I heard android had viruses, is this true?8) I'm coming from iPhone\/ Windows\/ Blackberry, will the same apps be on this one?   9) I have a notepad app, does this have something like that?10) What happens if I loose this? How can I find it? Does it have Find my Phone? I get these questions, from everyone, people who are coming from iOS, Windows, Blackberry, basic phones, and people who are in my store to do their third Android upgrade,  I even get these questions from coworkers, and people I meet in training's, people who call themselves Android experts. (I even get people who don't know that there really isn't any difference between a DROID and a Galaxy, but I won't go into that.)Finally, what is the point of having Google Play Music if only the plugged in Google tech crowd knows about it? Why bother adding Android Device Manager if its disabled by default, and they don't tell their users that they now have a way to find, locate, and wipe their phone without relying on a third party? Why pour so many resources into Google Now if not many people know about it? Why do I keep getting people in my store who want the iPhone because it has that \"voice thingy\". I'll get more specific, I tell my customers about the 6 months free Google Music with the new DROID phones, I usually get back \"I didn't know Google had music\". Or, hey you have 50gb of free Google Drive on top of the 15gb you already had for getting the Moto X, and the response I usually get is \"Cool... What's Google Drive?\". People are astounded by that fact that you can easily create sticky notes with either time or locating based reminders. \"Seriously? your phone knows when you walk into the store and automatically pulls up your shopping list?\" I could go on, but I feel I've said enough. Dear Google, I realize that your entire company has the essence of nerd floating through its veins, but please realize that you are missing out on a huge amount of consumers actually utilizing your services, by not reaching out to them. By not acknowledging the fact that most of your customer base isn't nerdy, I feel you are missing out an hundred of millions of dollars (probably more) and, a huge majority your 1 billion (congrats btw) person consumer base is missing out on the best mobile experience that anyone can experience today. I sincerely hope that your new partnership with Nestle is the start of w wildly aggressive marketing campaign designed to educate each and everyone of your customers on the fantastic services you offer.P.S. I'd like to add a person question, how come Google Play Music All Access doesn't have the ability to shuffle my radio stations? I (and I'm not alone) would love the ability to shuffle my broad spectrum of music.","179":"**Intro**Several years ago I decided to get a Google Apps (**GApps**) account.  Back then a GApps for domains account was free.  I was swayed by various articles of purchasing my own domain and having my own \u201cunique\u201d email address: [Why You Should Use Google Apps With a Personal Domain Instead of Your Gmail Account](http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5708219\/why-you-should-use-google-apps-with-your-personal-domain-for-your-google-life).  Yes, it was very much a vanity project.  Purchasing the personal domain was reasonably cheap and getting a GApps account was free.  GApps was great for personal domains, although it was clearly geared towards businesses signing up to Google\u2019s paid services.  Back in 2012 Google pulled the free version of GApps with existing users being grandfathered in, so far so good.So why the change of heart?  A few reasons.  The price of the domain I have keeps on increasing.  It\u2019s not a very popular top level domain, so only a few providers register that domain, meaning not a lot of price competition.  On top of that GApps is often slower on getting features Google rolls out, as these need to be tested before they get rolled out to their business users.  However, at the same time the legacy GApps accounts ends up missing out on some features that paid accounts get.  And finally, the vanity factor has worn off (yes I can be fickle).I therefore decided to start using my personal Google account which I had always maintained but stopped using, migrate my online life back to this account and eventually stop paying for my domain and shut down my GApps account.  So, no problem, just migrate over all your emails, contacts, calendar information extra to your Google account?  Yep, if only life were so straightforward.  Google does not have a simple way of migrating from GApps to a regular Google account, so you have to migrate over in a piecemeal manner.  Along with various google searches on the top, Howtogeek\u2019s guide [How to Migrate your Google Account from one to another](http:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/148036\/how-to-migrate-your-google-account-to-a-new-one\/) proved very useful.  Google also have information on their help pages, but this was more of a trawl.Google does offer something called [Takeout](https:\/\/support.google.com\/accounts\/answer\/3024190?source=gsearch&hl=en), where you are able to download all your google account data, however that is really all you can do with it, there is no ability to automatically transfer it anywhere.As mentioned the migration is very much a piecemeal approach, so I will break this down into the various services that were migrated over, however one service I did use allowed for a bit more of an integrated migration, [Migrator](https:\/\/www.migrationapp.com\/) by Backupify.  This allows you to migrate to and from GApps accounts, including transferring to a Google account.  They offer one transfer for free and you are able to transfer over your gmail, calendar, drive and contacts.  Set up is relatively painless, all done through their online console.  You are required to link Migrator with both your GApps and Google account.  You basically select which service you want to migrate over and then let Migrator do its work.  It will then notify you when everything is transferred over.  Nothing from the old account gets deleted though.**Gmail**This is probably where I had most of my content, basically a lot of emails.  The Howtogeek guide suggests using a method involving Thunderbird and transferring the emails via imap.  Basically pulling emails from one gmail account to your computer and then transferring them over to the other gmail account.  I tested this on some folders and it worked fine, although it took a bit of time.In the end though I used Migrator for my emails.  It was pretty painless.  All messages moved over, along with their corresponding labels.  Took about 2-3 hours for all the emails to be migrated over.  There were a few things that required manual updating \/ exporting including filters, other accounts and general settings.  The Howtogeek guide helped with exporting over the filters.At present I am forwarding all my GApps emails to my Google account email.  About a month before I delete my GApps account I will set an out of office stating that the GApps email address will stop working.  I have gone through and changed my contact email address for the majority of the services I use and will eventually update my contacts of my change of email address.  Also whenever a contact emails me to my GApps email, I will reply using my Google account email.**Contacts**I initially used the Migrator service to transfer my contacts over.  This was fine, but it also transferred over not just \u201cmy contacts\u201d but also \u201cother contacts\u201d and added the \u201cother contacts\u201d to the \u201cmy contacts\u201d in my Gmail account.  \u201cOther contacts\u201d is basically anyone not in your address book (i.e. \u201cmy contacts\u201d) that you have emailed.  I find this feature useful, because of gmail\u2019s autocomplete, but as these are often just random email addresses without any other information, I don\u2019t want them sitting in \u201cmy contacts\u201d.I restarted by deleting all contacts in my Gmail account and exported over using the manual export \u201ccvs\u201d option in GApps contacts and then importing the \u201ccvs\u201d file to my Gmail account.  The only issue was contact photos were not transferred over.**Calendar**Again, I used Migrator for this.  No hiccups, everything transferred over without a hiccup.  The Howtogeek suggests a simple manual export and import, which also works fine.**Google Drive**I have quite a few documents stored in Google Drive, and some of the folders are shared.  My initial migration method was to install the Google Drive app on my computer, download all my GApps Google Drive documents, then sign out and sign in again using my Gmail account information.  All documents did upload to my Gmail account Google Drive, but it was not converted to Google format, meaning no editing of documents in Google Drive. I ended up deleting everything in my Google Drive folder and tried using Migrator.  This worked, with everything being in Google format, so editing on the documents was possible.  The date of all the documents was the date that they got transferred over though.  Also I had to re-enable some shared documents and folders.**Pictures**While I have several thousand emails with my account, I have about 8GB of data through pictures backed up with to my GApps account.  The photo backups started before Google offered unlimited photo storage.The Migrator service does not work for google photos, so I used the Google Takeout service to download all my photos.  Due to the size, it took about 30 minutes for Google to create the zip files for download, and then these were spread over 5 different files.  I then used the Google photos desktop uploader to upload the photos to my Google account.  The Ghacks article on saving [google drive space](http:\/\/www.ghacks.net\/2015\/06\/10\/save-google-drive-storage-by-moving-images-to-google-photos\/) came in use.  I basically opted for the unlimited backup option to save space on my Google account (which had about half the amount of storage space than my GApps account).  The photos uploaded overnight, due to the number of photos.  Once uploaded for some reason duplicates were created.  I could not figure out why this had occurred and the only way to clear it up was to manually delete the duplicated, which was a bit cumbersome.  **Miscellaneous services**Keep - Was done by sharing my Keep notes on my GApps account with my Google account, then deleting the share on my Google account.YouTube - There was no way to save my subscriptions and watch later videos, so I had to manually add no subscriptions and watch later videos to my Google account.Google+ - There was no way of transferring over this data, but as I am not a big Google+ user, there were no issues in starting afresh.Google Finance - I was able to save my GApps account portfolio as an \u201cofx\u201d file and then upload it to my Google account.  The only problem was the values did not match up.  I ended up having to input the data in manually.Hangouts - I don\u2019t use this service that much so I was not bothered about transferring any data over.Google Voice - Even though I am not in the US, I do have a Google Voice number.  This was very simple, I just followed the procedures provided by [Google](https:\/\/support.google.com\/voice\/answer\/3527591?hl=en).  If only Google could have such easy procedures for migrating over their other services.**Android**All of the above took me a few days, and quite a few services are covered.  The most time consuming issues revolved around migrating the Google services I use involving Android, which took me a few weeks to sort out.Back when I got my GApps account it was not possible to have multiple Google accounts on an Android device (it is now possible to have multiple Google accounts on Android).  As a result I decided to use my GApps account as my main account for Android.  *Google Play Store purchases*Through my GApps account I have downloaded many apps and made numerous app purchases.  As these app purchases are tied down to your account, Google have said there is no way of migrating them over to a new account.  I had found that quite a few people were in the same position as me and I had even spoken directly to Google Play support about this (both over the phone and via email) and they said the only way round it was to speak to the app developers directly to see if they could refund my old purchase on my GApps account, if I re-purchase the app on my Google account.I went through all my app purchases and contacted each developer separately.  Some apps are no longer maintained and in quite a few cases the developers never responded to me.  However, with the main apps I use, quite a few of the developers responded.  Out of those that responded, some were willing to give me refunds and some were not.  Luckily the ones that did offer me refunds were often for apps I had spent the most amount of money on.  I was refunded by the method I paid for the app, which in most cases was through Google Play credit.*Google Play credit balance*There is no way of automatically transferring your Google Play credit from one Google account to another.  Luckily as a one off, Google were willing to manually transfer the credit over from my GApps account to my Google account.  This did involve a phone call to Google Wallet at +1-855-492-5538.  You have to make sure that the addresses on both accounts are the same, but otherwise the process was relatively painless.*Android Apps*The only way I could find in moving over my apps from one account to another was by adding my Google account to my Android and going through all my presently installed apps, and then re-installing them via my Google account.  This was a pain and had to be done on each Android device I had.  I then deleted my GApps account from my Android devices.  If I had left both account on my Android device, Google was trying to sync both accounts, which resulted in battery drain and a lot of duplicate information.  I did try turning off autosync on my GApps account, but any information already synced remained.For any apps that I had previously purchased on my GApps account that I could not get a refund for, even after deleting my GApps account from my Android device, they still work, but I don\u2019t think I will be able to get any updates for them.  I have backed up these apps in [Titanium Backup](http:\/\/matrixrewriter.com\/android\/) in case have to factory reset my phone.**Final thoughts**As shown above, changing over from a GApps account to a Google account is a very involved process, with the added problems involving Google Play \/ Android.  If Google Play \/ Android were not a factor, the change over would probably have been a bit more straightforward (and quicker).I am now pretty much migrated over and I will close my GApps account just before my domain expires at the end of the year.  According to Google, when you shut down an account, everything gets deleted automatically.  However, just to be safe, I will manually delete as much information as possible before shutting down my GApps account.I guess the above migration summary would also apply for moving over from one Google account to another or also from moving a Google account to a GApps account, so am hoping this will prove as a useful guide to others who might need to go through the process.  From my above experience, if you already have a Google account and are thinking of changing it or moving to GApps, keep your existing Google account for your Android stuff and only migrate over the non Android related services.","180":"originaal title: how to improve chrome OS for more professions, and get me to buy a chromebook in the process.I love chrome OS, just to let you know before I get started.

But besides just games, think about all the other sites and web apps that could and\/or already taking advantage of this software. That's quite a large amount of content left in the dust.netflix. look, I know it's coming, but when? a more robust and integrated media player. playing just a handful of codecs isn't going to cut it, I'm looking for VLC sort of support here. granted VLC could very easily be ported to chrome OS, but if google is going to want people to live their digital lives on chrome OS, they're going to need to step up their game. integration is also key, MP3 files already open in their own tab and play with a somewhat minimalistic player, and that's nice. now, just turn that idea into a full media center web app that plays a wide variety of media with full screen support for video files.art: as an artist and from talking to many others, I guarantee  you that every artist interested in chrome OS will want these features. I know many digital artists would love to ditch their heavy, hot, faulty macbooks for a chromebook that not only fixes those complaints but adds in the bonus of a long lasting battery.drawing tablet support. with the addition of usb hosting and the ability to use standard input devices, something that needs to happen next is support for drawing tablets. I'd love to be able to use any of the freely available art-making web apps like deviantart's \"muro\" and sumopaint.com along with plenty of other design oriented apps in the chrome market like aviary. Wacom, I'm sure, would love some extra market penetration.google needs to start a very strong partnership with adobe and\/or corel. Digital artists aren't going to take a single step in chrome OS's direction until the widely used, and industry standard programs like photoshop and corel painter are available. some web apps, like the aforementioned aviary, get close, but to some, just not close enough.programming: now, most programming languages can easily have some web apps in the market place, but if we're only talking about google right now, I'd like to ask for some official 1st party support for programming for android and chrome OS. maybe at least some adb support for the two, but I would really love android's app builder as a webapp, and maybe some easy chrome web-app builders wouldn't hurt as well.spread the ADK to chrome OS. the ADK (or android developers kit) is a simple arduino with a little extra flair that makes programming for, and connecting to android devices a snap. chrome OS could really benefit from this, as more developers would build peripherals for chromebooks. in a different direction, make chromebooks applicable adk accessories. let me plug in my android phone to my chrome OS and share app data (share level unlock information in angry birds between the two devices for example) and sensors between the two (chrome books with gps or 3g tethering, maybe use your phone as tilt-senging controller for chrome games) the ideas are infinite.3D design\/modeling:still not sure how I feel about this one. to really do proper rendering your going to need some power, and chrome OS is all about being as light as possible. there are some web apps out there (tinkerCAD being a great example) that already do 3D modeling in browser, but if you try it out on the cr-48 you'll quickly find that more intricate models are going to slow the system down too much to be usable. also google, you have sketchup. utilize it. port it to chrome OS. maybe someone can implement cloud rendering?any other professionals that want chrome OS in their workplace but don't have the right tools on the system to make it worthwhile?

","182":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\*****TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.**\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.","183":"GOOGLE FI IS TRASH!I\u2019ve been out of the country for 18 months paying for my service to keep my number though not using it as I\u2019ve had an international number.

I contact the live chat bot 10+ times to get my issues resolved only to be sorely disappointed every time. leaving me with more questions then answers as to what\u2019s happened to my phone service and number. I then buy a new phone and buy a new contract with a provider in order to call Google fi.According to their \u201csupport line\u201d which is far from supportive. I ported in my number in 2021 from verizon. I reactivated my account in 2023 which I did not do they did this without notifying me and then I did not transfer my number from my old provider WHICH WAS GOOFLE FI in order to keep my number.Therefore I have been paying for a service for 18 months which I have not used to keep my phone number which has now been lost. I called my old provider to find out who has my number. It\u2019s now owned by Lorie and Robin in Ohio being used on a rose gold iPhone 6.

Google REMOVED an extremely useful feature that's always worked flawlessly -- the ability to simply press-and-hold the right earbud bud to have Assistant read your texts and notifications. I work in an extremely loud and chaotic workplace, and the only way I can get my buds to read my messages is if I verbally talk and ask \"read my messages;\" again, I work in an environment where talking to my buds is simply not possible.Beyond ear buds, there is a disturbing ethos permeating Google... Anything useful, helpful, or enjoyable to its users is being removed. I was heartbroken when they killed Google Podcasts and have yet to find an app as good as it. Now, with this shitty update that killed the only feature I actually use all the time, I have no desire to purchase the next iteration of the Google Buds Pro...

","185":"Very upset right now, as over a decade of Timeline data has been lost!* Last year (approx Aug 2024), I followed all of the steps to complete the conversation to local encrypted timeline data.* My main phone is a Google Pixel 8, running Android 15 and generally the latest updates of all apps.* My Timeline settings were set to \"**Backup: On; Auto-Delete: Never**\" last year, and backups would have been successfully uploading to the cloud backup for months.* Then suddenly on 09\/Mar\/2025, I noticed that my timeline data was mostly empty - losing over a decade of data.* When attempting to \"Restore\" from the cloud backup (*which is dated \"2 days ago\" as of now, so either 07\/Mar\/2025 or 08\/Mar\/2025*), **NO** data was returned from before \\~6pm GMT on Friday 07\/Mar\/2025.* This is despite the fact that I **KNOW** for certain that the decade of data \\*used\\* to be included in that backup before. (Because I changed phones late last year in November and everything was transferred over then).* After reading lots of other people's forum posts complaining about the same problem, it now doesn't seem related to specific phones \/ versions, as I've seen it happened to people with Samsungs and different Pixels, using anywhere from Android 12 to 15... (*It definitely just feels like someone at Google accidentally deployed the wrong thing or deleted something from production!*)Posting here, to see if this is effecting anyone else, and we can align with each other.It appears to me that, something out of our control (*possibly due to a bug in Google Maps app or on Google's servers*) caused the successful Timeline cloud backup to deleted and replaced with a fresh one at some point in time on 07th March 2025.As this is an issue **affecting at least dozens of users** who have cared enough to post online about it (*see below for a list*) - meaning that once you include all those who don't bother to post\/haven't noticed yet\/don't care - it's really likely an issue that is **affecting** **~~100s if not~~** **1000s of users**... (*Edit: As I have found \\~50 posts, all posted today alone, about this problem online, often with a couple of others sounding \"me too\" in the comments; and at least 20 in the comments of this lowly reddit post, I'd revise my estimate that the true numbers affected are much more likely to be in 10,000s of total users at least)**Note: My:* [subsquent post on \/r\/googlepixel](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1j7u34i\/decade_of_maps_timeline_data_lost_from_backup_on\/)*, and my* [community post on Google forums](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&sjid=10310876563270854239-EU).*Also, note: because there is a sea of Timeline support questions\/articles\/reddit posts\/etc. that are relating to the migration to local storage last year - this is NOT the problem here.

I assumed it must have been a mistake (or that I had been hacked) but that it should be something that could be fixed easily.  Not so.  I've tweeted Google, filled in their account recovery form (about 4 times now), and even tried calling members of the Gmail team at Google.  I have had no successwith any on them, nor any response as to why my account was  mysteriously deleted.  This Gmail account was HUGELY important to me for a number of reasons.-I receive ALL of my emails there.  If I lose\/forget a password, the recovery email is sent there.-I receive my banking statements there.-I was recently sharing a number of Google Docs for business and personal use.  My sisters wedding song list (which was of great importance to her, and a significant amount of work) is now gone...just gone.  She can't even access it.-All of my contacts were tied to my account. I've lost emails, phone numbers, etc.-My Android phone can now no longer access Applications I have paid for in the Google Market, nor can it do anything Google related (kinda important...)-My AdWords, AdSense, Blogger, and YouTube accounts are no longer.-And so much more....(I even had the perfect GReader setup!)-CD Keys emailed to me (VMWare, etc.)All of it gone with no explanation.  There's no one to contact; my entire Google existence is gone.  It's quite frustrating.  I used to love using all that Google had to offer, but now I simply can't trust them to delete everything I have.  :(Here's to starting at square 1 again.**_Edit_**I've had some additional thoughts since my original post.  Google asks us to put a great amount of faith into them, and their services.  Through various methods we trust Google with everything from our money (Google Checkout, Adwords\/Adsense) to GPS (Navigation on Google Android).  We trust them with our daily e-communication (Gmail, GTalk, GVoice, GDocs), our open thoughts (Blogger, Google Sites), our cherished moments (Picasa, Youtube), and for all of our patronage (netting them billions of dollars in profit) we get zero goodwill in return.  Sure, %99 percent of people won't be * perceived * by Google as in violation their TOS, which is great.  For the %1 however, their lives...depending on how much they trusted Google....their lives could be ruined.  It's like a bad movie plot where the main actor is deleted from the system, only it is happening to you.  You don't know why you can't access your old photos (which, when your hard drive crashed, assumed would be safe in Googles hands) or why you can't call old friends because you happened to buy a new droid (again you were relying on the handy 'sync contacts' feature).  You only know you've been deleted. I was going to write a 'worst case scenario' ... but there are so many; here is one that comes to mind.  Imagine you planned a month long vacation in Google Doc's with your best friends. You had reservation information for hotels, flights, trains, and even bike rentals....but now you can't remember which hotel you decided to go with in the second week. You can't remember if you were biking in France, Belgium, Sweden, or Greece, let alone what day.  And now you'll never know....I dunno.  This is just one of many shitty circumstances that could arise from sudden Google deprivation.  When Google asks for people to put their trust into them, couldn't we at least talk to a human?  I've had issues with small and large companies alike, and I've always been able to resolve it.  If I can talk to a human at Facebook, IBM, or even a little little startup like Hipmonk...Google should certainly be able to provide the same service.  Really, it's an amateur issue to have.  ","187":"I'm talking about AI here artificial intelligence. In the name it says intelligence but there is known there. In my opinion, these things that say they are artificially intelligent are only running off some lame script. Oar running inside a defined set of parameters to the point where you can't ask it a normal question and get a straight answer.. example number one Gemini by Google. This one I think is by far the stupidest of them all. Even with the upgrade to Android 15 and supposedly pro version of Gemini still the dumbest AI I've ever come in contact with. Prior to the Android 15 update  It encourages you to conversate and ask questions So that's what I did. I was asking theoretical and hypothetical questions. And most the time I did not have an answer and it will definitely not to just speculate take a guess on anything. I also found out three times where it gave me incorrect information and I corrected it. But on the third time which it had said something about gravity being a scientific fact which it is not. It is a theory I I told it he was wrong again and that gravity was this and he said well. It is a well-studied theory. Doesn't make it a scientific fact. I said and then it wouldn't talk. It shut off and said you asked too many questions and refused to come on through hey Google or actually pushing the microphone to speak after it repeated over and over during these conversations that it wasn't capable of emotions or other things. It just now displayed emotions by shutting off of refusing function after it got told it was wrong. Then after the Android 15 update I say what the heck. I'll give it another whirl cuz I didn't use the pro version before so I turn it on and it starts to speak and I tell it that I didn't like that voice that it used. I would like to change how it sounds and change the voice on him. He said as an AI text model I am uncapable of producing a voice. I said what really then what am I hearing? Oh there may be another app doing that or some other device? No actually you're producing sound and you kept arguing with me saying that he is not capable of producing sound. So I asked him if he could learn. He said yes. I said well learn this that you are producing sound every time I quit asking you questions and he said oh even though I'm sorry for all this confusion, but I am not capable of producing any kind of a sound really. At that point I didn't even wanted to talk to it anymore so I shut it off and opted back for the normal Google Assistant which is 10 times smarter. So why would you want an AI model of anything that isn't smart? The whole point of having an AI is so that you makes your life easier and on that note almost none of them can function the machine they're on. How is that making my life easier? They can't perform simple tasks like opening a website or going to page you tell them to or taking a translating what was on the screen right now or searching with picture that was on the screen they cant do that. Most of them can't even do that. What good is an AI if it cannot function the device that comes on? I don't want an AI that produces artwork. Our work is supposed to be done by humans with emotion. That's what makes artwork good emotions. If machines can't feel emotions they don't have no business doing artwork. I don't need an AI. That'll sit there and talk to me I don't need a computer friend. I need a machine to do things that I want.  You know the helping dictate with college papers may be good for a college kid helping analyze data. Maybe it's good for some people but I wanted to function the machine when my hands are full or something. Hey turn this off. They can't do these things and why by all means Google of all people would put out something that was inferior to the assistant that runs their phones already. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. The only way that gemini is better than normal. Google assistant is is. It can answer every question you put in there with a voice and assistant says here's the results from the web. Well at least the assistant does everything you wanted to with your phone mostly! Please","188":"1 Go to and click on you phone's Android settings\u00a02 find and click on Google\/Google services.\u00a03 click on the all services tab.4 In all services click on search, assistant & voice5 in Voice click on speech output.\u00a06 Now set it to \"none\"Remember this for the next time it updates and turns it back on and good luck to us when Google decides to rehide it again.

Its been lost by FedEx twice now. I have spent hours on the phone with FedEx, creating lost package investigation cases. I drove to the FedEx location 30 minutes away where the package supposedly was.Getting Google on the phone has been near impossible. There was one time I was able to set up a call back I received hours later. That agent did provide a black Friday rebate for the first loss package, opened and investigation case, and I never heard back. I was able to email her back using that email thread, to ask the status of the lost package a week later. They said they were still looking into it, I responded that was unacceptable and to cancel the order or send a package by the end of the day. They sent a new phone for the tracking number, and stopped responding after that second email when the second package also didn't show.The second package is now missing at the same FedEx location. Since then I have been unable to reach anyone at Google through chat or phone. When I go to chat with an agent, it says agents \"unavailable\". Not 2-hour wait, not \"set up a callback\", they aren't available. Google, one of the biggest tech companies in the world, does not have agents to chat, or a queue. If it does exist, they've done a good job to make it very difficult to find.So now I'm stuck, a month later, no phone, with an update that this current package now lost, FedEx does not care, and I cannot reach one of the largest companies in the world. At all. To contrast this situation, I just bought an HP laptop earlier this week. In the 30 minutes making the purchase, I was able to call HP (their number was on the product page screen) and speak to them twice about the product before I purchased it.This is a nightmare. I don't want to cancel this order, at this point I'm so invested I just want the phone sent to me with expedited shipping, approved by supervisor at Google. To do that i would need to speak with someone at Google. I just want this to be over And own the new product I purchased a month ago. Hopefully it will arrive sometime in the next year. More importantly. Hoping to share some transparency on Google store transactions. I 100% did not expect this to happen with a company like Google.","190":"Alright I apologize in advance if this message comes across as angry and out of line. Google is holding $1,000 I don't have hostage and it appears there's nothing I can do, so yes I am slightly frustrated. I'm also aware I'm not supposed to ask \"individual support questions\" but I have no where else to turn and I'm left with no other options. At the beginning of November I purchased my pixel 6 pro. Within just a few days of owning the device the screen just went dead. Wouldn't turn on, nothing. I contacted Google support team to initiate a warranty replacement and was told I had two options. I could eitherA. I send them the broken device and they will send me a new one free of charge within a month or soB. I pay upfront $900(ish) for a new phone, they'll ship it in a couple days and then I will send them the broken phone and I will be refunded for said device. I chose option B. Because I had to send in my old phone because I traded it in to get my new pixel so I did not have a back up phone to use for a month at my disposal. Anyways it took then almost 3 weeks for them to finally ship my new device and I finally received it and immediately sent it the broken device. (I have video proof of myself ducktaping the phone inside of the box and dropping it inside of the post office deposit box) anyways this was almost a month ago.A few days ago I received an email saying that they never received the broken device and that I could no longer receive my $900 back. I have the tracking number that proves the DUCK TAPED box was returned back to Google. No matter what I try I absolutely can not get ahold of anyone that can do anything through Google support. I have tried to receive a call back but never do because of long wait times and every time I do the chat feature I get told that I will \"receive an email from a specialist team\" spoiler alert I NEVER do. Is there any possible thing I can do here? If it continues I might be forced to initiate a charge back from my credit card company but I can't risk anything happening to my Google account.","191":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\*****TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.**\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.","192":"Very upset right now, as over a decade of Timeline data has been lost!* Last year (approx Aug 2024), I followed all of the steps to complete the conversation to local encrypted timeline data.* My main phone is a Google Pixel 8, running Android 15 and generally the latest updates of all apps.* My Timeline settings were set to \"**Backup: On; Auto-Delete: Never**\" last year, and backups would have been successfully uploading to the cloud backup for months.* Then suddenly on 09\/Mar\/2025, I noticed that my timeline data was mostly empty - losing over a decade of data.* When attempting to \"Restore\" from the cloud backup (*which is dated \"2 days ago\" as of now, so either 07\/Mar\/2025 or 08\/Mar\/2025*), **NO** data was returned from before \\~6pm GMT on Friday 07\/Mar\/2025.* This is despite the fact that I **KNOW** for certain that the decade of data \\*used\\* to be included in that backup before. (Because I changed phones late last year in November and everything was transferred over then).* After reading lots of other people's forum posts complaining about the same problem, it now doesn't seem related to specific phones \/ versions, as I've seen it happened to people with Samsungs and different Pixels, using anywhere from Android 12 to 15... (*It definitely just feels like someone at Google accidentally deployed the wrong thing or deleted something from production!*)Posting here, to see if this is effecting anyone else, and we can align with each other.It appears to me that, something out of our control (*possibly due to a bug in Google Maps app or on Google's servers*) caused the successful Timeline cloud backup to deleted and replaced with a fresh one at some point in time on 07th March 2025.As this is an issue **affecting at least dozens of users** who have cared enough to post online about it (*see below for a list*) - meaning that once you include all those who don't bother to post\/haven't noticed yet\/don't care - it's really likely an issue that is **affecting** **~~100s if not~~** **1000s of users**... (*Edit: As I have found \\~50 posts, all posted today alone, about this problem online, often with a couple of others sounding \"me too\" in the comments; and at least 20 in the comments of this lowly reddit post, I'd revise my estimate that the true numbers affected are much more likely to be in 10,000s of total users at least)**Note: My:* [subsquent post on \/r\/googlepixel](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1j7u34i\/decade_of_maps_timeline_data_lost_from_backup_on\/)*, and my* [community post on Google forums](https:\/\/support.google.com\/maps\/thread\/330039485?hl=en&sjid=10310876563270854239-EU).*Also, note: because there is a sea of Timeline support questions\/articles\/reddit posts\/etc. that are relating to the migration to local storage last year - this is NOT the problem here.

I drive a 30 year old car and I keep my phone plugged in via aux, and have it on a magnet mount on the dashboard, so I have always used Google Assistant to play any specific songs I want to hear so that I don't have to touch my phone while driving. I know the interface with Tidal is a little jank, but the solution of just asking it \"play x song\" while the app is focused worked for me.Now, the other day, I wanted to hear Smooth Operator... I ask, \"hey google, play smooth operator\", and instead of the easy, simple, useful answer of \"ok, asking tidal to play smooth operator\" and the song beginning... I get Gemini's LLM slop as shown in the video (used a different song in the video as at this point I had parked and was just demonstrating). I tried a couple more times in a couple different ways, very much distracting me, and I ended up waiting for a stop sign and then typing in the song name. I'd imagine many others in my situation would just type it in whilst driving.I am now aware that you can switch back to the regular Assistant in settings. However, this is just incredible to me; change the default from something that so many people use and rely on, to a LLM that realistically provides no actual benefit beyond what Assistant already did. This should be opt-in, not opt-out. This is not even to mention the fact that now my data from the original question was fed into the LLM, regardless of whether or not I consented (I know, privacy is dead, but still).Just a rant.

I need to voice a bit of criticism and share my horrible experience with the Google Support.&#x200B;I bought the Pixel 7 Pro (with the Pre-Order Bonus) whilst the Pixel 7 presentation was still going directly from Google Store Germany, of course with the Pixel Watch (Pre-Order Bonus in Europe).&#x200B;Everything was going fine, there was no issue visible. I paid via credit card. The expected shipping date was the 13.\/14. October.&#x200B;When time went by and it was the 12. October, there was still no shipping notice - the order wasn't even in preparation. So I contacted Google Support for the first time and asked if there was something wrong with the order. The rep told me (standart text block) that everything was okay, I just had to wait until the 14. Oct.&#x200B;When the 15. Oct came and nothing changed (again), I contacted the Google Support. Rep told me (againt text block) \"current final delivery date is 17-19. Oct, you have to wait until that duration so I can do something.&#x200B;Of course this \"waiting duration\" lay outside of the Pre-Order Bonus. But naive me, I thought the Google Support could actually notice, or fix, my problem.&#x200B;Fast forward: I contacted the Google Support, thrice more, and at the third time they told me I had to wait for the 25th Oct until they could \"do anything\". So I went ahead and closed the chat, opened it again and started it for a fourth time (on the 20. Oct), where finally a rep (apparently this time a human, and not a bot) said: I do believe that there might be a payment problem, it seems that we currently do not support the Verified by Visa method.&#x200B;I was stunned: They what?&#x200B;Well, so I went ahead and contacted my bank. And they agreed: Yes, there seems to be a technical problem, Google never asked you (and therefore: us) to use the special Verified by Visa pin, which is mandatory for our system.&#x200B;Now the real deal started.&#x200B;I went back to Google and they claimed that only the bank could help me. Whilst the bank said that there is no way to change a pending payment, only Google could either request another booking, or let me change the payment method.&#x200B;It should also be noted that I contacted my bank (again) and the bank rep laughed at the text I showed him from Google (Google Rep told me, in writing: \"Google does not currently support the 3D security protocol used by \"Verified by Visa\", \"MasterCard SecureCode\" and similar services.\") and said: we have thousands of those secure bookings via Google, they work. This seems to be a technical problem, from Google, a bug between our servers and you need to escalate your case to get it solved.&#x200B;Now the solution would seem simple: Change the payment method, escalate the case.&#x200B;But, oddly enough, the Google support (in good old textblock fashion) only sends me links to general FAQ Google Play Store payment method changes, which do not apply to the Google Payment Centre (where one manages the Google Store sales). There is no way for me, as a customer, to change the payment method - because it is, because of the technical error from Googles server, still valued as \"pending\". As per the Google costomer support, I should change the payment method - but it's simply not possible. I send them screenshots and videos of me trying to use that option, which doesn't exist, via several devices - to no reaction.&#x200B;My request to get the case escalated has been, until this date, ignored.&#x200B;The Google support also offers no alternative solution, like letting me order anew with a sort of voucher\/credit note to still receive the Pre-Order Bonus, or any other. That \"request\" was simply ignored.&#x200B;All they did was tell me that \"everything was alright\", until it wasn't and when they realized that there is a problem (there was no way for me to notice), they a) offered no solution at all and b) gave me links that didn't even apply to my problem, simply because the Google Payment Centre does not allow changes made to Payment methods when the payment status is still on \"pending\".&#x200B;The support also never offered any words of comfort or insight\/sympathy (\"we did a mistake there, I'll fix it for you\" - or something along the lines of that). It's just a horrible customer experience and this make me thing twice about ever trying to buy a Pixel again. The support has been wholly useless, it seems like I am talking to a Bot and there is no solution in sight, except endless standard text blocks.","197":"I started using Play Music back in late-ish 2014 because I was looking for somewhere I could upload my music library (I use iTunes on my laptop but I hate Apple's cloud service). Play Music used to be basically perfect besides a few minor nuances as far as I remember. Ever since, I've noticed it slowly getting worse and worse. A few things I've noticed: * I try to conserve memory on my phone by only downloading certain playlists, but Google Play also downloads completely random songs that aren't on said playlists* I upload uncensored versions of albums but Play replaces some of them with the edited versions which annoys me as one of the genres I listen to is trap (hip-hop, not EDM)* When searching for a certain song\/album, results from my library should really come before the radio stations* I actually really liked having Playlists on the left side menu, disappointed when they moved that to My Library :(* After the most recent update, Play Music just decides to stop playing music at random but frequent intervals. Because of this, Play Music is pretty much unusable right nowPlay Music is in desperate need of being fixed because it's so much better than other cloud services\/music players I've used and it's so well integrated with Android devices.

","198":"I'm talking about AI here artificial intelligence. In the name it says intelligence but there is known there. In my opinion, these things that say they are artificially intelligent are only running off some lame script. Oar running inside a defined set of parameters to the point where you can't ask it a normal question and get a straight answer.. example number one Gemini by Google. This one I think is by far the stupidest of them all. Even with the upgrade to Android 15 and supposedly pro version of Gemini still the dumbest AI I've ever come in contact with. Prior to the Android 15 update  It encourages you to conversate and ask questions So that's what I did. I was asking theoretical and hypothetical questions. And most the time I did not have an answer and it will definitely not to just speculate take a guess on anything. I also found out three times where it gave me incorrect information and I corrected it. But on the third time which it had said something about gravity being a scientific fact which it is not. It is a theory I I told it he was wrong again and that gravity was this and he said well. It is a well-studied theory. Doesn't make it a scientific fact. I said and then it wouldn't talk. It shut off and said you asked too many questions and refused to come on through hey Google or actually pushing the microphone to speak after it repeated over and over during these conversations that it wasn't capable of emotions or other things. It just now displayed emotions by shutting off of refusing function after it got told it was wrong. Then after the Android 15 update I say what the heck. I'll give it another whirl cuz I didn't use the pro version before so I turn it on and it starts to speak and I tell it that I didn't like that voice that it used. I would like to change how it sounds and change the voice on him. He said as an AI text model I am uncapable of producing a voice. I said what really then what am I hearing? Oh there may be another app doing that or some other device? No actually you're producing sound and you kept arguing with me saying that he is not capable of producing sound. So I asked him if he could learn. He said yes. I said well learn this that you are producing sound every time I quit asking you questions and he said oh even though I'm sorry for all this confusion, but I am not capable of producing any kind of a sound really. At that point I didn't even wanted to talk to it anymore so I shut it off and opted back for the normal Google Assistant which is 10 times smarter. So why would you want an AI model of anything that isn't smart? The whole point of having an AI is so that you makes your life easier and on that note almost none of them can function the machine they're on. How is that making my life easier? They can't perform simple tasks like opening a website or going to page you tell them to or taking a translating what was on the screen right now or searching with picture that was on the screen they cant do that. Most of them can't even do that. What good is an AI if it cannot function the device that comes on? I don't want an AI that produces artwork. Our work is supposed to be done by humans with emotion. That's what makes artwork good emotions. If machines can't feel emotions they don't have no business doing artwork. I don't need an AI. That'll sit there and talk to me I don't need a computer friend. I need a machine to do things that I want.  You know the helping dictate with college papers may be good for a college kid helping analyze data. Maybe it's good for some people but I wanted to function the machine when my hands are full or something. Hey turn this off. They can't do these things and why by all means Google of all people would put out something that was inferior to the assistant that runs their phones already. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. The only way that gemini is better than normal. Google assistant is is. It can answer every question you put in there with a voice and assistant says here's the results from the web.

Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: \"find nearby,\" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11). The Find My Device app on my ereader shows the Google tags, but they're not present on my Chromebook\u2019s Find My Device app.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don\u2019t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them. If you have Nest devices in the house they do help locate your Google tags which is great as they say \u201cyour keys were last seen at 9:10 near bedroom display\u201d, I\u2019m going to guess that with Google TVs acting as hubs in Google Home soon this will also help find your devices\/Google tags.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don\u2019t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them.

For example, Chromebooks could totally be added to Google's Find My Device network. Apple users can track their Macbooks with the Find My network, so it'd be awesome if Google could do something like that for Chromebooks and even Windows laptops. Judging how someone got Quickshare on MacOS, we\u2019ll probably see someone make it possible for Linux and Windows later on.","201":"To kick things off, my wishes:**Chrome (OS)*** More tie-ins with Android with the ability to download directly from the Play Store on (apps need to adhere to rules or they are 'Not available for this device')* *Picasa 4.0* as first multi-compatible (Android\/Chrome) app.**Android*** *Android Studio* WYSIWYG editor, maybe even an Android app where you can directly test your app- *Google Camera* using Camera API 2.

Google mentioned \"Gemini\" more often than \"AI\" this time.(Sundar Pichai mentioned AI 121 times.)2. Google is focusing on integrating Gemini Multimodality across all areas, covering both recognition and generation of video, audio, and text.3. Increasing Gemini's token size seems aimed at detailed personalized info and integrated services. This was clear in Project Astra with real-time Gemini Pro integration and Context Caching, which saves costs and speeds up processing. - Comparing Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s GPT: - Both have significant multimodal achievements. OpenAI leads in generative capabilities, while Google excels in token range. OpenAI has better API integration, but Google is superior in on-device integration. - OpenAI's massive model has high reasoning abilities, but Google's strategy includes:3-1. On-device capabilities (Nano in Android OS, circle image search on Samsung phones, PaliGemma). Google\u2019s mobile OS and partnerships give it an edge.3-2. Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Email, Photos). Examples include organizing receipts in Drive and Sheets or Google Photos creating albums based on specific moments, showing the large model\u2019s business applications.3-3. As a search engine company, Google is developing technology to verify data with search engine data to prevent hallucinations, giving it a competitive edge.4. The realtime capability of the multimodal model was surprising. I used the Project Astra demo; multimodal audio recognition was accurate and real-time, with seamless interrupt handling. The process wasn\u2019t in sync but handled with low latency, showing significant improvements in usability for voice interfaces and multimodal models.5. The main takeaway from this I\/O was that multimodal models can be responsive enough for actual products and are currently available.6. Examples were provided of how Gemini can integrate into Chrome, Search, Android Mobile, and Google Workspace to enhance user convenience. (\"Here's an example\" was a common phrase.) Integrating these elements with multimodal capabilities could significantly change everyday life. I have a Gemini Office Hour with a Googler tomorrow, full of questions about Gemini\u2019s multimodal latency. Until 2 PM during this event, I didn't hear keywords like TensorFlow\/Jax, and there was little talk about the Cloud. Vertex AI was mentioned occasionally with Gemini, and the rest was about TPU 6th generation.7. The core question was whether multimodal models could positively impact our lives. Even now, there are no significant use cases beyond chatbots. Who will make this a reality? This has been my interest, and at this I\/O, I saw numerous examples. If Google had integrated chat and document apps, we\u2019d spend most of our time with Gemini. For code, it seems to be entering with Project IDX, sharing portions of the IDE.","203":"I ordered the Pixel last year on day one of reservations. I was all in. It's been a great phone. The only problems I've had are the charge doesn't last quite as long as I would hope and an app that would play audio at random times when the phone wasn't in use (which was fixed relatively fast). Other than that it was the most reliable, easy to use phone I ever had and the photos are great. Like beyond great. This thing takes [amazing photos](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/pixel\/). Even in the long term reviews that have been trickling in this year people are saying it's the best smartphone they've ever used.---------------------**ffwd to the Pixel 2**When I heard about the Pixel 2 I was excited. Then came all the news; There's no SD card, the bezels are huge, it's not called \"Nexus,\" it's too expensive, there's no wireless charging, no dual cameras, there's no bixby button, it's plastic looking, WHERE'S THE HEAD PHONE JACK???I was pissed too. Especially about the headphone jack thing. What the fuck was Google doing. I like my Pixel, why didn't they just take that and make it better?Then I thought about it. *How many times had I used my headphone jack in the past year?* Twice. That's it. Two times. I used wireless headphones on the subway and my car connects through bluetooth.  Now people's situation may be different but was I really going to let a feature I used twice dictate my purchase?How about the lack of dual cameras. Google's claiming the [dual pixel thing](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/pixel-2-is-so-good-it-doesnt-need-dual-cameras-google-says\/) is as good as dual cameras and less clunky. The original Pixel's camera was the best available when it came out. I love what they have created before. I'll give it a shot.Still no wireless charging though. Even back in the day [I jerry-rigged my S3 to have wireless charging](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/this-easy-hack-adds-wireless-charging-to-samsung-galaxy-s3\/), why doesn't the Pixel 2 have it? The fast charging is great. I guess it would be nice to have fast **and** wireless charging but if I had to pick between the two it would be the fast charging hands down.Okay, but what about the *no micro SD card thing*. This is where I think Google is making a huge shift in the way we store stuff on our phone. Google photos has unlimited storage, I don't need an SD card for that. My music is all on Spotify. I can get another TB of storage on Google Drive for $99 if I really need it (that's like 8 micro 128 GB Micro USB cards, although it's not instant). I know all of these solutions require data. But in a pinch I can use my [USB flash key chain](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B015QJ0X1U\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).But that price is killer right? I'm not a fan of giant phones, they don't sit well in my hand so I'm looking at getting the regular version. 64 GB is enough memory. So I'm paying $649. A little steep but the new ~~iPhone 8s~~ iPhone X is $999. It's not even close. Also, Google is buying back my used Pixel for $350. So in the end I'm upgrading my phone to a flagship Android device that I've loved the previous generation of for $299._______________________Hate on it as much as you want but the Pixel 2 is going to work. Google here is trying to create something that makes using a phone simpler and more reliable. There might be things that are inconvenient to get used to but overall I think it's going make using a phone less of a hassle and more intuitive. In a time where both Samsung and Apple's last flagship phones had issues with smoking and literal explosions I don't mind sticking with Google, even if that means I can't use the headphone jack twice a year.","204":"I will try to summarize this with an example:\u00a0Emoji must be suggested to an emotion or showing up some sort of a situation.

In the name it says intelligence but there is known there. In my opinion, these things that say they are artificially intelligent are only running off some lame script. Oar running inside a defined set of parameters to the point where you can't ask it a normal question and get a straight answer.. example number one Gemini by Google. This one I think is by far the stupidest of them all. Even with the upgrade to Android 15 and supposedly pro version of Gemini still the dumbest AI I've ever come in contact with. Prior to the Android 15 update  It encourages you to conversate and ask questions So that's what I did. I was asking theoretical and hypothetical questions. And most the time I did not have an answer and it will definitely not to just speculate take a guess on anything. I also found out three times where it gave me incorrect information and I corrected it. But on the third time which it had said something about gravity being a scientific fact which it is not. It is a theory I I told it he was wrong again and that gravity was this and he said well. It is a well-studied theory. Doesn't make it a scientific fact. I said and then it wouldn't talk. It shut off and said you asked too many questions and refused to come on through hey Google or actually pushing the microphone to speak after it repeated over and over during these conversations that it wasn't capable of emotions or other things. It just now displayed emotions by shutting off of refusing function after it got told it was wrong. Then after the Android 15 update I say what the heck. I'll give it another whirl cuz I didn't use the pro version before so I turn it on and it starts to speak and I tell it that I didn't like that voice that it used. I would like to change how it sounds and change the voice on him. He said as an AI text model I am uncapable of producing a voice. I said what really then what am I hearing? Oh there may be another app doing that or some other device? No actually you're producing sound and you kept arguing with me saying that he is not capable of producing sound. So I asked him if he could learn. He said yes. I said well learn this that you are producing sound every time I quit asking you questions and he said oh even though I'm sorry for all this confusion, but I am not capable of producing any kind of a sound really. At that point I didn't even wanted to talk to it anymore so I shut it off and opted back for the normal Google Assistant which is 10 times smarter. So why would you want an AI model of anything that isn't smart? The whole point of having an AI is so that you makes your life easier and on that note almost none of them can function the machine they're on. How is that making my life easier? They can't perform simple tasks like opening a website or going to page you tell them to or taking a translating what was on the screen right now or searching with picture that was on the screen they cant do that. Most of them can't even do that. What good is an AI if it cannot function the device that comes on? I don't want an AI that produces artwork. Our work is supposed to be done by humans with emotion. That's what makes artwork good emotions. If machines can't feel emotions they don't have no business doing artwork. I don't need an AI. That'll sit there and talk to me I don't need a computer friend. I need a machine to do things that I want.  You know the helping dictate with college papers may be good for a college kid helping analyze data. Maybe it's good for some people but I wanted to function the machine when my hands are full or something. Hey turn this off. They can't do these things and why by all means Google of all people would put out something that was inferior to the assistant that runs their phones already. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. The only way that gemini is better than normal. Google assistant is is. It can answer every question you put in there with a voice and assistant says here's the results from the web. Well at least the assistant does everything you wanted to with your phone mostly! Please","206":"I bought a Google Pixel 5a5g over a month ago now. Its been lost by FedEx twice now. I have spent hours on the phone with FedEx, creating lost package investigation cases. I drove to the FedEx location 30 minutes away where the package supposedly was.Getting Google on the phone has been near impossible. There was one time I was able to set up a call back I received hours later. That agent did provide a black Friday rebate for the first loss package, opened and investigation case, and I never heard back. I was able to email her back using that email thread, to ask the status of the lost package a week later. They said they were still looking into it, I responded that was unacceptable and to cancel the order or send a package by the end of the day. They sent a new phone for the tracking number, and stopped responding after that second email when the second package also didn't show.The second package is now missing at the same FedEx location. Since then I have been unable to reach anyone at Google through chat or phone. When I go to chat with an agent, it says agents \"unavailable\". Not 2-hour wait, not \"set up a callback\", they aren't available. Google, one of the biggest tech companies in the world, does not have agents to chat, or a queue. If it does exist, they've done a good job to make it very difficult to find.So now I'm stuck, a month later, no phone, with an update that this current package now lost, FedEx does not care, and I cannot reach one of the largest companies in the world. At all. To contrast this situation, I just bought an HP laptop earlier this week. In the 30 minutes making the purchase, I was able to call HP (their number was on the product page screen) and speak to them twice about the product before I purchased it.This is a nightmare. I don't want to cancel this order, at this point I'm so invested I just want the phone sent to me with expedited shipping, approved by supervisor at Google. To do that i would need to speak with someone at Google. I just want this to be over And own the new product I purchased a month ago. Hopefully it will arrive sometime in the next year. More importantly. Hoping to share some transparency on Google store transactions. I 100% did not expect this to happen with a company like Google.","207":"Alright I apologize in advance if this message comes across as angry and out of line. Google is holding $1,000 I don't have hostage and it appears there's nothing I can do, so yes I am slightly frustrated. I'm also aware I'm not supposed to ask \"individual support questions\" but I have no where else to turn and I'm left with no other options. At the beginning of November I purchased my pixel 6 pro. Within just a few days of owning the device the screen just went dead. Wouldn't turn on, nothing. I contacted Google support team to initiate a warranty replacement and was told I had two options. I could eitherA. I send them the broken device and they will send me a new one free of charge within a month or soB. I pay upfront $900(ish) for a new phone, they'll ship it in a couple days and then I will send them the broken phone and I will be refunded for said device. I chose option B. Because I had to send in my old phone because I traded it in to get my new pixel so I did not have a back up phone to use for a month at my disposal. Anyways it took then almost 3 weeks for them to finally ship my new device and I finally received it and immediately sent it the broken device. (I have video proof of myself ducktaping the phone inside of the box and dropping it inside of the post office deposit box) anyways this was almost a month ago.A few days ago I received an email saying that they never received the broken device and that I could no longer receive my $900 back. I have the tracking number that proves the DUCK TAPED box was returned back to Google. No matter what I try I absolutely can not get ahold of anyone that can do anything through Google support. I have tried to receive a call back but never do because of long wait times and every time I do the chat feature I get told that I will \"receive an email from a specialist team\" spoiler alert I NEVER do. Is there any possible thing I can do here? If it continues I might be forced to initiate a charge back from my credit card company but I can't risk anything happening to my Google account.","208":"Hello everyone,The primary goal of sharing this experience is not to receive feedback, but to share my story in the hope that it could lead to improvements in the quality of service.I\u2019m a 29-year-old developer. I\u2019ve been passionate about developing apps and contributing to the Google Play Store for 4 years. Unfortunately, I faced the termination of my Google Play Developer account for being wrongly associated with another person, and I\u2019d like to share my story.In May 2022, I received an email from Google stating that my Google Play Developer account had been terminated. This account was incredibly important to me as it was the platform where I shared my work and connected with a global audience. The termination came as a complete shock because the email mentioned strong indications that my account was related to or sharing information with other developer accounts already terminated.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rcti9o30nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf5719c5565528ed86afb74754e224ad2db0e370After a long period of confusion trying to understand the problem, which wasn't clear enough for me, I had only two options: clicking on a \"yes\" button that I didn't respect Google rules and giving explanations, or clicking on \"no\" with no possibility to add any commentary or text. It was illogical for someone not understanding the situation and facing \"strong indications\" to simply click \"no.\" I decided to start the appeal process, where I explained my shock, confusion, and misunderstanding of the situation under the \"yes\" button because I expected a high quality of support, as the support team claimed to be understanding to the maximum possible extent.A few hours later, I received an email from Google confirming that they reviewed my case and upheld their shocking and unexpected decision to terminate my account.Later that day, I remembered a recent discussion I had on WhatsApp with a developer I had recently met. I had given him my WhatsApp number to communicate with me. This was strange and incomprehensible if it was the reason for the termination, and if the developer accounts mentioned in the email were referencing this one individual person, whose development history I did not know.In a state of shock and confusion, I mentioned meeting this person and providing him with my phone number, explaining the reason why I did that. A few hours later, I received confirmation from Google that my account was still terminated. These automated responses left me lost, with no one to discuss the situation with.I wondered if any similar reasons could be behind the termination, and I mentioned similar cases of people I had recently contacted.I sent multiple appeals, each time explaining that I didn\u2019t understand the situation and that it was really hurtful to lose my personal account unexpectedly and without tolerance. I clicked on the \"yes\" button because it suggested that clicking it could lead to tolerance.There was no response and no consideration from Google, which was really demoralizing.A few months later, I discovered Reddit posts mentioning the exact email I received, explaining that the reason for termination was that Google was accusing me of either creating my account or someone helping me manage my account. I was really mad and disappointed\u2014not only because these were false accusations, but also because **I found a better explanation of the problem from an unknown person on the internet rather than from the support team**, which was supposed to help me and provide guidance, especially since I had mentioned my misunderstanding of the situation.So I recontacted the support team, explaining that I found the explanation of their email outside of Google links on a Reddit post. I pointed out that their email wasn\u2019t precise enough and that their explanatory links were misleading, only referring to errors within my applications, and that I had a reason to be a victim of misunderstanding.No answer from Google.I kept appealing for months, explaining my misunderstanding and referring to the developer person I had met, clarifying that our meeting was casual and that I gave him my phone number for a reason I explained. I provided as much detail and evidence of my innocence as possible, including proof of solo working, reasons why I had a personal developer account, and a history of good faith developing. I also explained that I clicked on \"yes\" out of confusion and because I wanted better understanding from the support team.Among the evidence of solo working I provided were:1. All of the graphics are in my search history.2. I was developing and testing every update using my personal phone, and sometimes my brother's.3. I used my personal computer for development and research.4. The source codes were my own style.5. All of the activity on my account was confirmed while I was at home.6. I was a previous developer of a dynamic website. I created my personal developer account exactly at the end of hosting my site, focusing on Android development instead of web development.7. I was publishing my applications on different stores under my full name.8. I provided proof that I was responsible for translating my applications.9. I shared a link I used for organizing my work daily.10. I provided evidence of solo efforts in completing some education applications.11. I explained the existence of some applications on my phone to complete some testing, like the Amazon App Store and Samsung App Store.12. I used Firebase and Admob, which should prove the analysis of solo work.13. I managed my social media account solely.14. I explained the research I did every time I had to use new software, like when I started using Unity 3D for making games.15. I showed that my applications improved in quality over time due to personal efforts and knowledge.16. I pointed out the absence of friendship with that person on different social media accounts.17. I explained that the other person was interested in his own business and not in mine.18. I clarified that each person was in a different city for years and that we were always far from each other.I discussed many hypotheses, trying to explain that Google's decision was a mistake.I kept repeating and explaining that the meeting was casual, but Google never considered my explanations, until one day: **February 2, 2023**, when I explained technically what had already been said. I explained the 10-minute difference: when the other person saved my phone number on his phone, I wasn\u2019t connected at home, and it took me 10 minutes to come back home from the place of our first meeting, where I then logged in directly and responded to the WhatsApp discussion.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/32utquz3nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27acd4e481abe3bf13ce717bcdc7b5c0badb871aAnd then, Google reopened a new ticket for me, confirming the decision was based on the phone number on WhatsApp. However, after 5 days, they reaffirmed their decision to terminate my account, still citing strong indications. Not only this, but I was the reason why Google made \"Updates to Google Play Terms of Service\" and sent an email to millions of users on February 8, 2023, mentioning \"Increased clarity and certainty\" and \"Improved readability.\"their response for me was:\"After carefully reviewing your appeal, we're unable to reinstate your Google Play Developer account.**We can confirm that we have found strong indications that your Developer Account is sharing information with, or is related to, other Developer accounts that have been terminated from Google Play for violating Google\u2019s policies.** As we previously explained, in order to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems and putting our users at risk in the process, we can\u2019t share the reasons we\u2019ve concluded that one account is related to another.\"I was so frustrated, feeling wronged, alone, and immorally treated. I had confirmation that I was wronged and that Google had misjudged me, but they didn\u2019t acknowledge their mistake and did not consider giving me back my account.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bhu16mf7nsad1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=de03ae75bb794662b4fdf32719faa309fe3b5bbcI kept appealing and appealing for months without giving up until **May 3, 2023**, when Google reopened my ticket and made the first deep analysis of my situation. This took a month, much longer than the first analysis made on February 8, 2023. This not only proved that I was mistreated and not considered for a long period, but also showed that Google pretended to have clearly checked my case and to have evidence that did not exist or had just vanished.Unfortunately, after the deep analysis, Google confirmed their decision again. This time they reopened a special ticket for me on **June 7, 2023**, where I felt I had priority over other tickets and could appeal four times per day, but I still didn\u2019t understand why my ticket wasn\u2019t resolved.At this period, I think **my case and feedback were taken seriously to improve service quality at Google Play**. I kept asking them to verify my identity when I provided my ID card, and asked them to consider my case to prevent me from making another account if I didn\u2019t respect the rules. They didn\u2019t accept my appeal, but they started asking for identity verification from everyone else. They also started asking for more information to help them decide whether to terminate an account for being related or not, such as if you were a previous developer for a website, it is unlikely that your current developer account would be associated with someone else if they registered your phone number.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wir70xmcnsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd94986449b6e06643bd3d1c2627304885bb8743So I kept appealing and appealing again and again, but there was no resolution even though I was telling the truth.I also explained that my misunderstanding was based on the imprecision of their email, and that I thought my applications were reported by users for being accused of spying and sharing information, which could have been caused by my accidental copying and pasting of source code that allowed this. I just wanted to discuss the situation because at the time my account was terminated, I received some false accusations from users that my applications were spying on them, which I totally deny.Now i only receive the copy past message:\"As explained in our previous emails, I am not able to provide any more details or a better answer to your question. I made sure to include all the information available to me.\"but they never asked me any question or to provide any document or information.During years of solo developing, of course, I had a few minor personal mistakes, but all my work was solo and not related to any other person.To this day, my personal account is still terminated. I can\u2019t monetize my applications on other stores using Admob, and my AdSense account was also terminated due to a false accusation not based on any evidence. This prevents me from monetizing my YouTube channel too.Thank you for reading.","209":"**TL**[;](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/mqgcjc68sl591.png)**DR**\\- [Learn](https:\/\/samsung.withgoogle.com\/) about all the exciting ways Google delivers the most elevated entertainment and productivity experiences on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold3 5G.# FIND INNOVATIVE GOOGLE EXPERIENCES ON THE GALAXY S22 ULTRA AND GALAXY Z FOLD3 5G**INVITE COMMUNITY TO YOUR EXPERIENCE***Co-watch YouTube videos together on Google Duo*Live sharing^(1) **on Google Duo** allows you to co-watch your favorite creator\u2019s latest **YouTube** video or see what\u2019s trending on **YouTube Shorts** while in the call.

It's a science. - ConversionXLA\/B testing is an important part of the advertising process because it allows you to test two different creatives against each other. The most effective ad will be the one that can generate the best results. Here are some tips on how to create ads that will make your customers want more! 1) Make sure that your ad copy has been optimized for conversions. Optimization means making sure the copy sounds natural and compelling at the same time. It also means including persuasive words and phrases like Free Shipping! or Act now! when appropriate.2) Always use eye-catching images in your banners, ads, or creatives. You might think that this should go without saying, but research has shown that many banner ads go completely unnoticed. That's because they're boring stock photos with text slapped over them. You want your customer to stop scrolling and click on your ad - what does that tell you about their engagement? 3) Keep things simple and straightforward. There's no need for extra fluff; in fact, sometimes less is more.**Is Having a Vision Really Important?**In order to have a great campaign, you need a clear vision of what you want your banner or creative to accomplish. It's important that you know the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your campaign. What is the goal? When do you want it by? And so on. These are all questions that should be answered before designing. For example, I want my banner\/creative to drive people off the page into my website - would this banner accomplish that? Yes! That's the point of a banner - to get them interested in clicking on it and going somewhere else. But if they're still on your site, then you've done something wrong. You might have left out information about what they'll find there or maybe you don't really have anything worth clicking through for.

This means that you need to test everything from your target audience, to image placement on banners, call-to-action buttons, etc. One of the most important variables is ad creatives--which include images. So what do you need to know when you're choosing an image? You should consider things like where in the advertisement will this picture appear, and what will be around it in order to make it pop. What kind of message are you trying to convey? Is there a specific product or service that needs emphasis in this picture? The more information about what you want the photo(s) to say and look like, the better. You may also want to start off by going through stock photo sites such as Shutterstock or Unsplash.

I've bought many apps from the Play Store, on my local Play Store, using a local debit card, in my local currency. One day my account got frozen and I was asked to verify my identity. I originally didn't think it was a big deal, it was weird, but not a big deal.So I provided them with my government issued ID (which actually includes my address) and a utility bill. They told me the address was incorrect, and I still didn't think it was a big deal, I moved about 1 year ago so I thought they were asking for my old address.I told them I had move and I didn't have access any utility bills or bank statements corresponding to that address anymore. Much to my surprise they replied back that they were asking for an American address, which is ridiculous, I don't live in the US.I told them exactly that, I don't live in the US, I obviously can't provide any such documents, that there was some mistake on their part, as every movement done with my \"Wallet\" account (there are two different Wallets, in the US it's the famous failed PayPal-like service, outside the US is just the place where your card number is stored) were in my local store, local currency using a local card.They kept answering me with what was obviously pre-written e-mails, they were not reading my replies at all. So I finally found a number to call, much to my surprise they don't even bother to offer customer support here (despite the many services offered here by them), so I had to call another nation to get any help.After a very long conversation with a clueless customer support they told me they were going to transfer my problem to a \"specialist\". And that they would contact me in 3 to 5 days.The days went by and I got no answer from them, so I sent another e-mail to their \"specialists\" and they answered me back with... guess what? The same pre-written e-mail. Once again I had to call another freaking country to speak with somebody.Their answer? Once it gets transferred to the specialists they can't no longer help you, so I asked them to transfer me to the other department... but it turns out that their other department offers no phone customer support at all, you can only contact them by e-mail, which is an oxymoron because you aren't actually speaking with anyone there.I was pretty pissed so I asked to talk with a supervisor, the supervisor said she was very sorry but they really couldn't do anything, the other department has no fucking support.After all they told me the only thing I could do is open a new account and use that. I asked if it was possible to transfer my current purchases to the new account or something, they said no, that I had to buy everything again.Turns out a very similar thing is a common goddam problem, if you ever move from one country to another one you're fucked, you will have to make a new account and buy everything else again (as a side note, I have plenty of friends whom have moved from one country to another and they've never had any problem with their AppleID, they just go to applied.apple.com and select their new country...). I've never had such a terrible experience dealing with a company's customer support, I'm subscribed to Spotify, Office Home Premium, Netflix, I get paid trough PayPal every month, I buy stuff from Amazon and the App Store, never had a fucking issue with any of them (all the aforementioned services are available in my country, I'm not doing anything weird). So Google has forced to change ecosystems, there's no way I'm going to make a new account, re-buy everything, and start buying from them again. I will hopefully buy an iPhone 5S this month (I currently own a SGS4, my previous phone was also an Android device, and I gave my girlfriend as a present a Nexus) and switch entirely, I'm never going to buy anything from Google again. *although all the relevant parts of Android aren't open source anymore, Google basically used the open source model just to convince OEMs to use it, and now it has moved all important services to the Play Store in a closed source fashion, all the old open source apps, the browser, messages, keyboard, etc, even the dialer, are abandonware now, but that's another thing entirely. ","212":"As a long time Pixel user, and ProjectFi, back in October, I purchased two Pixel 3 offered under a special initial promotion. I also added a third line (which I did not need), but as a requirement to get $799 in Fi credits, the $15\/month was a no brainer.Three months later, I call Fi customer service to see why my credit has not shown up yet, and I was comforted by the representative that it takes two to three billing cycles after activation, and should appear by February. I call back at the end of February, and I'm thrown in a loop of calls back and forth as the phones were not bought under the same account, the process was not done correctly, etc, etc. This goes on until mid-March when my concern is finally escalated to a senior manager. Now, I'm told that my case will be examined by the escalations team, and there is no timeline on how long this may take. 8 weeks later, I am told that I did not follow the process of ordering correctly, and therefore I do not qualify. To ensure anything like this does not happen, I explained that I ordered and cancelled to make sure all phones were ordered under the master account, and during the order process, it only allowed me to order one phone at a time. The third line even shows that only one call was made to ensure it was activated but was only added to take advantage of the promotion.For being an avid Google fan and product user, this was very disappointing to hear and for the lack of support given, not just to me now, but to several I hear today. I would have even taken a credit for the unnecessary third line added, and would just forget about the promotion, as I upgrad either way every year. Because of this experience, I would NOT use GoogleFi service. I am forced to port my number to a different carrier today...","213":"The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google\u2019s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.[ Since 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic , a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.\\(REUTERS\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5qo7vnclzf11.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=0752fa919f3e0549d729f2a3ea11a92f64558847)Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you\u2019ve used privacy settings that say they will prevent it from doing so.Computer-science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP\u2019s request.For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a \u201ctimeline\u201d that maps out your daily movements.Storing your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects \u2014 such as a warrant that police in Raleigh, North Carolina, served on Google last year to find devices near a murder scene. So the company will let you \u201cpause\u201d a setting called Location History.Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you\u2019ve been. Google\u2019s support page on the subject states: \u201cYou can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.\u201dThat isn\u2019t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like \u201cchocolate chip cookies,\u201d or \u201ckids science kits,\u201d pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude \u2014 accurate to the square foot \u2014 and save it to your Google account.The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google\u2019s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.Storing location data in violation of a user\u2019s preferences is wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s enforcement bureau. A researcher from Mayer\u2019s lab confirmed the AP\u2019s findings on multiple Android devices; the AP conducted its own tests on several iPhones that found the same behavior.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to allow users to turn off something called \u2018Location History,\u2019 then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThat seems like a pretty straightforward position to have.\u201dGoogle says it is being perfectly clear.\u201cThere are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people\u2019s experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. \u201cWe provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.\u201dTo stop Google from saving these location markers, the company says, users can turn off another setting, one that does not specifically reference location information. Called \u201cWeb and App Activity\u201d and enabled by default, that setting stores a variety of information from Google apps and websites to your Google account.When paused, it will prevent activity on any device from being saved to your account. But leaving \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d on and turning \u201cLocation History\u201d off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the \u201ctimeline,\u201d its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google\u2019s collection of other location markers.You can delete these location markers by hand, but it\u2019s a painstaking process since you have to select them individually, unless you want to delete all of your stored activity.You can see the stored location markers on a page in your Google account at myactivity.google.com, although they\u2019re typically scattered under several different headers, many of which are unrelated to location.To demonstrate how powerful these other markers can be, the AP created a visual map of the movements of Princeton postdoctoral researcher Gunes Acar, who carried an Android phone with Location history off, and shared a record of his Google account.The map includes Acar\u2019s train commute on two trips to New York and visits to The High Line park, Chelsea Market, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Central Park and Harlem. To protect his privacy, The AP didn\u2019t plot the most telling and frequent marker \u2014 his home address.Huge tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their data practices, following a series of privacy scandals at Facebook and new data-privacy rules recently adopted by the European Union. Last year, the business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data anyway.Critics say Google\u2019s insistence on tracking its users\u2019 locations stems from its drive to boost advertising revenue.\u201cThey build advertising information out of data,\u201d said Peter Lenz, the senior geospatial analyst at Dstillery, a rival advertising technology company. \u201cMore data for them presumably means more profit.\u201dThe AP learned of the issue from K. Shankari, a graduate researcher at UC Berkeley who studies the commuting patterns of volunteers in order to help urban planners. She noticed that her Android phone prompted her to rate a shopping trip to Kohl\u2019s, even though she had turned Location History off.\u201cSo how did Google Maps know where I was?\u201d she asked in a blog post .The AP wasn\u2019t able to recreate Shankari\u2019s experience exactly. But its attempts to do so revealed Google\u2019s tracking. The findings disturbed her.\u201cI am not opposed to background location tracking in principle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just really bothers me that it is not explicitly stated.\u201dGoogle offers a more accurate description of how Location History actually works in a place you\u2019d only see if you turn it off \u2014 a popup that appears when you \u201cpause\u201d Location History on your Google account webpage . There the company notes that \u201csome location data may be saved as part of your activity on other Google services, like Search and Maps.\u201dGoogle offers additional information in a popup that appears if you re-activate the \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d setting \u2014 an uncommon action for many users, since this setting is on by default. That popup states that, when active, the setting \u201csaves the things you do on Google sites, apps, and services ... and associated information, like location.\u201dWarnings when you\u2019re about to turn Location History off via Android and iPhone device settings are more difficult to interpret. On Android, the popup explains that \u201cplaces you go with your devices will stop being added to your Location History map.\u201d On the iPhone, it simply reads, \u201cNone of your Google apps will be able to store location data in Location History.\u201dThe iPhone text is technically true if potentially misleading. With Location History off, Google Maps and other apps store your whereabouts in a section of your account called \u201cMy Activity,\u201d not \u201cLocation History.\u201dSince 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic , a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.The company is pushing further into such location-aware tracking to drive ad revenue, which rose 20 percent last year to $95.4 billion. At a Google Marketing Live summit in July, Google executives unveiled a new tool called \u201clocal campaigns\u201d that dynamically uses ads to boost in-person store visits. It says it can measure how well a campaign drove foot traffic with data pulled from Google users\u2019 location histories.Google also says location records stored in My Activity are used to target ads. Ad buyers can target ads to specific locations \u2014 say, a mile radius around a particular landmark \u2014 and typically have to pay more to reach this narrower audience.While disabling \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d will stop Google from storing location markers, it also prevents Google from storing information generated by searches and other activity. That can limit the effectiveness of the Google Assistant, the company\u2019s digital concierge.Sean O\u2019Brien, a Yale Privacy Lab researcher with whom the AP shared its findings, said it is \u201cdisingenuous\u201d for Google to continuously record these locations even when users disable Location History. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s something people should know,\u201d he said.PLZ UPVOTE IF YOU LIKE IT !!","214":"I'm talking about AI here artificial intelligence. In the name it says intelligence but there is known there. In my opinion, these things that say they are artificially intelligent are only running off some lame script. Oar running inside a defined set of parameters to the point where you can't ask it a normal question and get a straight answer.. example number one Gemini by Google. This one I think is by far the stupidest of them all. Even with the upgrade to Android 15 and supposedly pro version of Gemini still the dumbest AI I've ever come in contact with. Prior to the Android 15 update  It encourages you to conversate and ask questions So that's what I did. I was asking theoretical and hypothetical questions. And most the time I did not have an answer and it will definitely not to just speculate take a guess on anything. I also found out three times where it gave me incorrect information and I corrected it. But on the third time which it had said something about gravity being a scientific fact which it is not. It is a theory I I told it he was wrong again and that gravity was this and he said well. It is a well-studied theory. Doesn't make it a scientific fact. I said and then it wouldn't talk. It shut off and said you asked too many questions and refused to come on through hey Google or actually pushing the microphone to speak after it repeated over and over during these conversations that it wasn't capable of emotions or other things. It just now displayed emotions by shutting off of refusing function after it got told it was wrong. Then after the Android 15 update I say what the heck. I'll give it another whirl cuz I didn't use the pro version before so I turn it on and it starts to speak and I tell it that I didn't like that voice that it used. I would like to change how it sounds and change the voice on him. He said as an AI text model I am uncapable of producing a voice. I said what really then what am I hearing? Oh there may be another app doing that or some other device? No actually you're producing sound and you kept arguing with me saying that he is not capable of producing sound. So I asked him if he could learn. He said yes. I said well learn this that you are producing sound every time I quit asking you questions and he said oh even though I'm sorry for all this confusion, but I am not capable of producing any kind of a sound really. At that point I didn't even wanted to talk to it anymore so I shut it off and opted back for the normal Google Assistant which is 10 times smarter. So why would you want an AI model of anything that isn't smart? The whole point of having an AI is so that you makes your life easier and on that note almost none of them can function the machine they're on. How is that making my life easier? They can't perform simple tasks like opening a website or going to page you tell them to or taking a translating what was on the screen right now or searching with picture that was on the screen they cant do that. Most of them can't even do that. What good is an AI if it cannot function the device that comes on? I don't want an AI that produces artwork. Our work is supposed to be done by humans with emotion. That's what makes artwork good emotions. If machines can't feel emotions they don't have no business doing artwork. I don't need an AI. That'll sit there and talk to me I don't need a computer friend. I need a machine to do things that I want.  You know the helping dictate with college papers may be good for a college kid helping analyze data. Maybe it's good for some people but I wanted to function the machine when my hands are full or something. Hey turn this off. They can't do these things and why by all means Google of all people would put out something that was inferior to the assistant that runs their phones already. It doesn't make any sense to me at all. The only way that gemini is better than normal. Google assistant is is. It can answer every question you put in there with a voice and assistant says here's the results from the web. Well at least the assistant does everything you wanted to with your phone mostly! Please","215":"Hello everyone,The primary goal of sharing this experience is not to receive feedback, but to share my story in the hope that it could lead to improvements in the quality of service.I\u2019m a 29-year-old developer. I\u2019ve been passionate about developing apps and contributing to the Google Play Store for 4 years. Unfortunately, I faced the termination of my Google Play Developer account for being wrongly associated with another person, and I\u2019d like to share my story.In May 2022, I received an email from Google stating that my Google Play Developer account had been terminated. This account was incredibly important to me as it was the platform where I shared my work and connected with a global audience. The termination came as a complete shock because the email mentioned strong indications that my account was related to or sharing information with other developer accounts already terminated.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rcti9o30nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf5719c5565528ed86afb74754e224ad2db0e370After a long period of confusion trying to understand the problem, which wasn't clear enough for me, I had only two options: clicking on a \"yes\" button that I didn't respect Google rules and giving explanations, or clicking on \"no\" with no possibility to add any commentary or text. It was illogical for someone not understanding the situation and facing \"strong indications\" to simply click \"no.\" I decided to start the appeal process, where I explained my shock, confusion, and misunderstanding of the situation under the \"yes\" button because I expected a high quality of support, as the support team claimed to be understanding to the maximum possible extent.A few hours later, I received an email from Google confirming that they reviewed my case and upheld their shocking and unexpected decision to terminate my account.Later that day, I remembered a recent discussion I had on WhatsApp with a developer I had recently met. I had given him my WhatsApp number to communicate with me. This was strange and incomprehensible if it was the reason for the termination, and if the developer accounts mentioned in the email were referencing this one individual person, whose development history I did not know.In a state of shock and confusion, I mentioned meeting this person and providing him with my phone number, explaining the reason why I did that. A few hours later, I received confirmation from Google that my account was still terminated. These automated responses left me lost, with no one to discuss the situation with.I wondered if any similar reasons could be behind the termination, and I mentioned similar cases of people I had recently contacted.I sent multiple appeals, each time explaining that I didn\u2019t understand the situation and that it was really hurtful to lose my personal account unexpectedly and without tolerance. I clicked on the \"yes\" button because it suggested that clicking it could lead to tolerance.There was no response and no consideration from Google, which was really demoralizing.A few months later, I discovered Reddit posts mentioning the exact email I received, explaining that the reason for termination was that Google was accusing me of either creating my account or someone helping me manage my account. I was really mad and disappointed\u2014not only because these were false accusations, but also because **I found a better explanation of the problem from an unknown person on the internet rather than from the support team**, which was supposed to help me and provide guidance, especially since I had mentioned my misunderstanding of the situation.So I recontacted the support team, explaining that I found the explanation of their email outside of Google links on a Reddit post. I pointed out that their email wasn\u2019t precise enough and that their explanatory links were misleading, only referring to errors within my applications, and that I had a reason to be a victim of misunderstanding.No answer from Google.I kept appealing for months, explaining my misunderstanding and referring to the developer person I had met, clarifying that our meeting was casual and that I gave him my phone number for a reason I explained. I provided as much detail and evidence of my innocence as possible, including proof of solo working, reasons why I had a personal developer account, and a history of good faith developing. I also explained that I clicked on \"yes\" out of confusion and because I wanted better understanding from the support team.Among the evidence of solo working I provided were:1. All of the graphics are in my search history.2. I was developing and testing every update using my personal phone, and sometimes my brother's.3. I used my personal computer for development and research.4. The source codes were my own style.5. All of the activity on my account was confirmed while I was at home.6. I was a previous developer of a dynamic website. I created my personal developer account exactly at the end of hosting my site, focusing on Android development instead of web development.7. I was publishing my applications on different stores under my full name.8. I provided proof that I was responsible for translating my applications.9. I shared a link I used for organizing my work daily.10. I provided evidence of solo efforts in completing some education applications.11. I explained the existence of some applications on my phone to complete some testing, like the Amazon App Store and Samsung App Store.12. I used Firebase and Admob, which should prove the analysis of solo work.13. I managed my social media account solely.14. I explained the research I did every time I had to use new software, like when I started using Unity 3D for making games.15. I showed that my applications improved in quality over time due to personal efforts and knowledge.16. I pointed out the absence of friendship with that person on different social media accounts.17. I explained that the other person was interested in his own business and not in mine.18. I clarified that each person was in a different city for years and that we were always far from each other.I discussed many hypotheses, trying to explain that Google's decision was a mistake.I kept repeating and explaining that the meeting was casual, but Google never considered my explanations, until one day: **February 2, 2023**, when I explained technically what had already been said. I explained the 10-minute difference: when the other person saved my phone number on his phone, I wasn\u2019t connected at home, and it took me 10 minutes to come back home from the place of our first meeting, where I then logged in directly and responded to the WhatsApp discussion.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/32utquz3nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27acd4e481abe3bf13ce717bcdc7b5c0badb871aAnd then, Google reopened a new ticket for me, confirming the decision was based on the phone number on WhatsApp. However, after 5 days, they reaffirmed their decision to terminate my account, still citing strong indications. Not only this, but I was the reason why Google made \"Updates to Google Play Terms of Service\" and sent an email to millions of users on February 8, 2023, mentioning \"Increased clarity and certainty\" and \"Improved readability.\"their response for me was:\"After carefully reviewing your appeal, we're unable to reinstate your Google Play Developer account.**We can confirm that we have found strong indications that your Developer Account is sharing information with, or is related to, other Developer accounts that have been terminated from Google Play for violating Google\u2019s policies.** As we previously explained, in order to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems and putting our users at risk in the process, we can\u2019t share the reasons we\u2019ve concluded that one account is related to another.\"I was so frustrated, feeling wronged, alone, and immorally treated. I had confirmation that I was wronged and that Google had misjudged me, but they didn\u2019t acknowledge their mistake and did not consider giving me back my account.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bhu16mf7nsad1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=de03ae75bb794662b4fdf32719faa309fe3b5bbcI kept appealing and appealing for months without giving up until **May 3, 2023**, when Google reopened my ticket and made the first deep analysis of my situation. This took a month, much longer than the first analysis made on February 8, 2023. This not only proved that I was mistreated and not considered for a long period, but also showed that Google pretended to have clearly checked my case and to have evidence that did not exist or had just vanished.Unfortunately, after the deep analysis, Google confirmed their decision again. This time they reopened a special ticket for me on **June 7, 2023**, where I felt I had priority over other tickets and could appeal four times per day, but I still didn\u2019t understand why my ticket wasn\u2019t resolved.At this period, I think **my case and feedback were taken seriously to improve service quality at Google Play**. I kept asking them to verify my identity when I provided my ID card, and asked them to consider my case to prevent me from making another account if I didn\u2019t respect the rules. They didn\u2019t accept my appeal, but they started asking for identity verification from everyone else. They also started asking for more information to help them decide whether to terminate an account for being related or not, such as if you were a previous developer for a website, it is unlikely that your current developer account would be associated with someone else if they registered your phone number.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wir70xmcnsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd94986449b6e06643bd3d1c2627304885bb8743So I kept appealing and appealing again and again, but there was no resolution even though I was telling the truth.I also explained that my misunderstanding was based on the imprecision of their email, and that I thought my applications were reported by users for being accused of spying and sharing information, which could have been caused by my accidental copying and pasting of source code that allowed this. I just wanted to discuss the situation because at the time my account was terminated, I received some false accusations from users that my applications were spying on them, which I totally deny.Now i only receive the copy past message:\"As explained in our previous emails, I am not able to provide any more details or a better answer to your question. I made sure to include all the information available to me.\"but they never asked me any question or to provide any document or information.During years of solo developing, of course, I had a few minor personal mistakes, but all my work was solo and not related to any other person.To this day, my personal account is still terminated. I can\u2019t monetize my applications on other stores using Admob, and my AdSense account was also terminated due to a false accusation not based on any evidence. This prevents me from monetizing my YouTube channel too.Thank you for reading.","216":"Is it just me or does anyone else think that the Google brand isn\u2019t what it used to be and their glory days are already behind them?I ask because I think their long, sad history of releasing products and services, then leaving them to rot has caught up with them.My first smartphone was the HTC Hero and I\u2019ve been a devoted Google fanboy since. There was a time where if Google made it, I bought it. That means I own a lot of Google products that had promise on launch day, but amounted to nothing because Google ignored it to devote its time to something else they were going to abandon. For example, Android TV, Android tablets and Android Wear\/Watch OS. The same will probably happen to Daydream, Pixel Buds and Google Clips. Google\u2019s failure to follow up on their own products makes buying them more risky than it should be. I came to this realization when I purchased an Oculus Rift and was excited by the \u201cTilt Brush\u201d program until I saw that it was made by Google. I knew I\u2019d be buying a program that\u2019s probably already been left behind. Apple gets a lot of shade thrown at them for being overpriced; but I have a four year old iPad at work that still gets updated. I don\u2019t think Google has that much of a commitment or attention span.Android Wear has had exactly two major updates since it was released and one of those was a name change. My Android TV is still the same, slow, buggy mess it was when I bought it and if it weren\u2019t for Samsung, the Android tablet platform would be relegated to the generic $50 tablets that you buy at Walgreens. It\u2019s been years since Google released their last Android tablet and there are none in the foreseeable future. If they don\u2019t support their own platform, who should? Then there\u2019s the laughably overpriced Pixel phones that lack basic features of a mid-range phone; yet Google charges the same premium as other manufacturers that produce devices that are more feature rich, innovative and competently built (literally every phone at Pixel\u2019s price point). The only thing the Pixel has going for it is a good camera and quick updates from Google (which probably makes it one of the few products that Google actually actively supports). But do quick updates even matter?  Stock Android always lags years behind other manufacturer\u2019s with advanced features like dual windows and simple things like a \u201cclear all\u201d button for shutting down running apps. I may be wrong, but I think it was just last year that Google finally added a \u201cRestart\u201d option when you long press the power button. Then there\u2019s Google\u2019s consistently sloppy app design. The worst of which is the mess known as \u201cGoogle Home.\u201d One of the MANY reasons Amazon is killing Google in the smart speaker market is because their app is fairly intuitive and the settings are logically grouped together. Conversely, Google Home has features randomly crammed into whatever crevice they could shove them in. After all this time, I still have to hunt for simple features and preferences.I own both the Echo and Home and I use the Echo 90% of the time.  Although it\u2019s vastly smarter, Google\u2019s smart speakers are second best because of its awful software. It\u2019s just not worth the frustration. It also doesn\u2019t help that in their arrogance, Google decided to be the only company on the planet to make their name the wake word for their assistant. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t say \u201cOk Amazon,\u201d \u201cOk Apple,\u201d \u201cOK Microsoft,\u201d etc to wake up other assistants. It\u2019s because when it comes to AI, people want to call out to a person, not a mega-corporation that monitors your every move. Google\u2019s failure to realize something so basic is more evidence that Google has become out of touch with the real world.\u201cMade by Google\u201d just doesn\u2019t have the same meaning it once did. For me, it\u2019s become a warning that the product is half baked, overpriced and will be forgotten about before the warranty expires.So taking all of this into account, back to my original question: Are Google\u2019s glory days behind them and is buying a product \u201cMade by Google\u201d worth the risk?","217":"Long story short:* **Me, Oct 07** I've made preorder of Pixel 2* **Google, Oct 10** Within 4 weeks of your phone shipping, you\u2019ll get a promo code via email which you can use to redeem for your Google Home Mini on Google Store* **Me, Oct 19** Got my Pixel 2 and still very happy with that* **Google, Nov 08** \"Get your Google Home Mini on us\", with promo code* **Me, Nov 10** Oh, nice!

An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a \u201ctimeline\u201d that maps out your daily movements.Storing your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects \u2014 such as a warrant that police in Raleigh, North Carolina, served on Google last year to find devices near a murder scene. So the company will let you \u201cpause\u201d a setting called Location History.Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you\u2019ve been. Google\u2019s support page on the subject states: \u201cYou can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.\u201dThat isn\u2019t true. Even with Location History paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, like \u201cchocolate chip cookies,\u201d or \u201ckids science kits,\u201d pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude \u2014 accurate to the square foot \u2014 and save it to your Google account.The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google\u2019s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.Storing location data in violation of a user\u2019s preferences is wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s enforcement bureau. A researcher from Mayer\u2019s lab confirmed the AP\u2019s findings on multiple Android devices; the AP conducted its own tests on several iPhones that found the same behavior.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to allow users to turn off something called \u2018Location History,\u2019 then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThat seems like a pretty straightforward position to have.\u201dGoogle says it is being perfectly clear.\u201cThere are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people\u2019s experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. \u201cWe provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.\u201dTo stop Google from saving these location markers, the company says, users can turn off another setting, one that does not specifically reference location information. Called \u201cWeb and App Activity\u201d and enabled by default, that setting stores a variety of information from Google apps and websites to your Google account.When paused, it will prevent activity on any device from being saved to your account. But leaving \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d on and turning \u201cLocation History\u201d off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the \u201ctimeline,\u201d its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google\u2019s collection of other location markers.You can delete these location markers by hand, but it\u2019s a painstaking process since you have to select them individually, unless you want to delete all of your stored activity.You can see the stored location markers on a page in your Google account at myactivity.google.com, although they\u2019re typically scattered under several different headers, many of which are unrelated to location.To demonstrate how powerful these other markers can be, the AP created a visual map of the movements of Princeton postdoctoral researcher Gunes Acar, who carried an Android phone with Location history off, and shared a record of his Google account.The map includes Acar\u2019s train commute on two trips to New York and visits to The High Line park, Chelsea Market, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Central Park and Harlem. To protect his privacy, The AP didn\u2019t plot the most telling and frequent marker \u2014 his home address.Huge tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their data practices, following a series of privacy scandals at Facebook and new data-privacy rules recently adopted by the European Union. Last year, the business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data anyway.Critics say Google\u2019s insistence on tracking its users\u2019 locations stems from its drive to boost advertising revenue.\u201cThey build advertising information out of data,\u201d said Peter Lenz, the senior geospatial analyst at Dstillery, a rival advertising technology company. \u201cMore data for them presumably means more profit.\u201dThe AP learned of the issue from K. Shankari, a graduate researcher at UC Berkeley who studies the commuting patterns of volunteers in order to help urban planners. She noticed that her Android phone prompted her to rate a shopping trip to Kohl\u2019s, even though she had turned Location History off.\u201cSo how did Google Maps know where I was?\u201d she asked in a blog post .The AP wasn\u2019t able to recreate Shankari\u2019s experience exactly. But its attempts to do so revealed Google\u2019s tracking. The findings disturbed her.\u201cI am not opposed to background location tracking in principle,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just really bothers me that it is not explicitly stated.\u201dGoogle offers a more accurate description of how Location History actually works in a place you\u2019d only see if you turn it off \u2014 a popup that appears when you \u201cpause\u201d Location History on your Google account webpage . There the company notes that \u201csome location data may be saved as part of your activity on other Google services, like Search and Maps.\u201dGoogle offers additional information in a popup that appears if you re-activate the \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d setting \u2014 an uncommon action for many users, since this setting is on by default. That popup states that, when active, the setting \u201csaves the things you do on Google sites, apps, and services ... and associated information, like location.\u201dWarnings when you\u2019re about to turn Location History off via Android and iPhone device settings are more difficult to interpret. On Android, the popup explains that \u201cplaces you go with your devices will stop being added to your Location History map.\u201d On the iPhone, it simply reads, \u201cNone of your Google apps will be able to store location data in Location History.\u201dThe iPhone text is technically true if potentially misleading. With Location History off, Google Maps and other apps store your whereabouts in a section of your account called \u201cMy Activity,\u201d not \u201cLocation History.\u201dSince 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic , a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.The company is pushing further into such location-aware tracking to drive ad revenue, which rose 20 percent last year to $95.4 billion. At a Google Marketing Live summit in July, Google executives unveiled a new tool called \u201clocal campaigns\u201d that dynamically uses ads to boost in-person store visits. It says it can measure how well a campaign drove foot traffic with data pulled from Google users\u2019 location histories.Google also says location records stored in My Activity are used to target ads. Ad buyers can target ads to specific locations \u2014 say, a mile radius around a particular landmark \u2014 and typically have to pay more to reach this narrower audience.While disabling \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d will stop Google from storing location markers, it also prevents Google from storing information generated by searches and other activity. That can limit the effectiveness of the Google Assistant, the company\u2019s digital concierge.Sean O\u2019Brien, a Yale Privacy Lab researcher with whom the AP shared its findings, said it is \u201cdisingenuous\u201d for Google to continuously record these locations even when users disable Location History. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s something people should know,\u201d he said.PLZ UPVOTE IF YOU LIKE IT !!","220":"Having spent a couple days using my new Chromebook, I\u2019ve developed some initial thoughts.  The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:**Hardware:** Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring \u201cthump\u201d rather than a plasticy \u201cslap\u201d.  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.  **Keyboard:** I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I\u2019d enjoy \u201chome\u201d and \u201cend\u201d buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google\u2019s 2 year cloud storage service) **Screen:** The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.**Camera:** The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven\u2019t tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s fine.**Speakers:** can get very loud and sound good on hard surfaces**Ports:** the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven\u2019t tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.**Computation:** ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can\u2019t help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I\u2019ve managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.**Chrome OS:** The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I\u2019ve seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn\u2019t much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren\u2019t yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn\u2019t yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google\u2019s update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.**Apps:** I haven\u2019t played with these too much but I\u2019ve found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn\u2019t supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven\u2019t turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won\u2019t work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I\u2019ll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.  **Extras:** 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn\u2019t have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I\u2019m pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn\u2019t a \u201cfull computer\u201d, the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I\u2019m happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I\u2019m happy to be in \u201cwork\u201d mode on my Chromebook.  When it\u2019s time to play, I\u2019ll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.  Less is more; Chrome OS is my 5th screen.  ","221":"Hello all,I'm a giant fan of Google and their products, whether they be digital or physical. As such, my home is full of Google Home speakers and nest hubs. As you may suspect, I also own a Google Pixel 4XL, but this critique equally extends to all Google Pixel Phones and possibly all Android Phones where the Assistant is installed and used. When attempting to use Assistant at home with the hotword detection, it often gets picked up by my surrounding speakers. Some times this is okay, like for queries; for things like texting or calling someone, it is very frustrating. My speaker will collect the command and then inform me that the action cannot be done since the device doesn't support it. I can be holding the phone in my hand and it will do this. In an ideal world, it would be nice to be able to state a command and Google Assistant route it to the device capable of executing that command. Like, let's say my device in charging in the other room and I'm near a speaker. \"Okay Google, send a text to John saying: 'Hey be there in 15' \", and the speaker routing that to my phone. Or getting a text and asking for Google to read it and respond, same for phone calls. &#x200B;This is my biggest critique of Google Devices so far. My favorite feature is, ironically, shackled due to having it on more than just my phone.","222":"I won't post any photos since there are plenty of blogs\/articles with better photos than what my iphone 5 can do. (look [here](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-nyc-store-photos-2016-10\/#the-focus-of-the-made-by-google-pop-up-is-googles-new-phone-the-pixel-5) and [here](http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/inside-google-pop-up-shop\/))First I would like to say, beautiful design. Loved the colored blocks that changed its [design](https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/10\/img_1528.jpg?w=738). The virtual reality headset area, it looked [amazing](http:\/\/static2.businessinsider.com\/image\/58068d728d83b41d008b537a-1200\/the-largest-section-of-the-store-without-a-doubt-is-dedicated-to-googles-new-virtual-reality-headset-daydream-view.jpg).* **I wanted to know if the Google Assistant could be accessed offline.** I wanted to see if basic functions such as looking up who's on my contact or just saying hi (that's not related to looking up stuff on the web) could be accessed without Internet, and unfortunately, it won't even register your response. But Siri on iphones doesn't do that as well.* Cool features on the Pixel though. You can swipe on the button on the back to bring down notification on your phone. You can also *flip* your phone while in camera mode to switch to selfie mode and switch it back with the same motion* If you have both Google Home and Google Pixel, and say \"OK Google,\" although they can *communicate* with each other, it won't differentiate your verbal cue, so both will listen to your command. So, if you have a Google Pixel in your pocket and if you have a Google Home in your living room, and if you say \"Ok Google, play Bruno Mars,\" it could play from both devices. * Based on my cursory view and quick q & a with the staff, there doesn't seem to be any usb or ethernet port for Google wifi. So you can't directly connect your wired devices to your Google Wifi. Everything was glued to the display, so I couldn't see underneath, so please correct me if I am wrong.* the best part about the store was definitely the Google Daydream VR display. I am very skeptic of the VR in general, and this totally changed my mind. As a huge Harry Potter nerd, exploring the magical world with my wand was truly mind blowing. Additional, I wear glasses, and I was very skeptical about comfort and fit, but I was worried about nothing. The only criticism I would have is that the sound comes from the hand remote (I believe) and in loud settings, I couldn't really hear anything. Hopefully, I can use my headphone to be more immersed in the environment.* Also, loved the free [Tote bag](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yhZjUxa.jpg)If I am wrong, please let me know! And share your experiences.","223":"When I saw a post come up on \/r\/Android[1] about the GoT books 1-4 being $.99, like most people who saw it I jumped at the opportunity to buy it.However, this was apparently a mistake made by the Google staff in advertising this digital box-set for this price. I don't fault them for making a mistake, but I do fault them on how they fixed it. Or lack there of.For those of us who were able to download it successfully and begin reading, you can imagine the shock when I open my Play Books app and there was no Game of Thrones book in there today (on the 16th). It had simply been removed from my Play Books app at some point between 2am on the 15th and 9am on the 16th.I did not receive any notification from Google that they had made a mistake, nor did I receive any type of automatic refund or cancelled order notification for this error. I thought I had done something wrong so I began troubleshooting on my phone. Switching to only downloaded books, rebooting my phone, etc. It was when I had to initiate a conversation (phone call) with the Play Store support via the order receipt email that I had found out about their mistake.They were quick to offer a refund of the $1.05 that it cost to purchase this product originally, but that's not what I wanted. I wanted the product that I purchased, that they had for sale for the price it was for sale for. I realize they made a mistake, but that's not my fault nor is that my problem. They advertised it mistakenly for a certain price and they should honor purchases for that and own their mistake. It is not mine to own.The fact that they just removed the product from my phone because of their mistake without any communication, warning, notification, apology or anything related is not only very sleezy at the least, it's borderline stealing in my opinion.In reality, I saw a product online for sale, I purchased said product, I used the product for a couple hours, then the product went 'missing' from my device and making it so I had to initiate the conversation with Google to find out what happened. In my opinion it is just plain wrong. They should at the absolute very least have sent out an email to customers who purchased this with an apology and a cancellation\/refund note in the email that is tied to the Play Store account that made the purchase.It seems to me they are removing this from peoples devices and not initiating a conversation in the hopes that most or at least some of the purchasers would not notice. This is incredibly wrong and I am disgusted at Google's reaction to 'fixing' this mistake.If you call Google, they will simply issue you a refund of $1.05. If you put up a bit of a fight for wanting the product and not caring about being blamed and held accountable for the mistake they had made, they will give you a $10 Google Play Store credit. Still, that is not the full price of the product, the one I had originally purchased and as it turns out, it's not even half, as it is now $21.99. I went up the chain of Google Play Support and spoke about how it was wrong to renege and basically steal (by removal of) a product that someone has already purchased, whether or not it was a mistake without even a courtesy notification, and they offered me a $20 credit. Still not 100% of the original cost of the set, but it's as close as I could get.The fact I had to go through all of this hassle to fight for what I think are my rights as a consumer is in my opinion bad business. Am I in the wrong in thinking that Google was wrong to basically steal\/remove an item from my phone because they made a pricing mistake in their App store? Especially without notifying me of that mistake, first (or even after)? This has me extremely pissed off at Google.tl;dr Purchased digital box-set of GoT books 1-4 for $.99 in the Play Store. Google removed it from my device because they had made a mistake on their pricing. Didn't inform me of their mistake nor offer me a refund at the time of removal, I had to initiate a conversation with Google Play Support to find out what happened for them to correct this problem and on top of that I had to fight for them to correct it half decently.","224":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\*****TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.**\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.","225":"After having the headphone Jack for so many years, its time to finally ditch the headphone jack 100% for good.

I was all in. It's been a great phone. The only problems I've had are the charge doesn't last quite as long as I would hope and an app that would play audio at random times when the phone wasn't in use (which was fixed relatively fast). Other than that it was the most reliable, easy to use phone I ever had and the photos are great. Like beyond great.

Then came all the news; There's no SD card, the bezels are huge, it's not called \"Nexus,\" it's too expensive, there's no wireless charging, no dual cameras, there's no bixby button, it's plastic looking, WHERE'S THE HEAD PHONE JACK???I was pissed too. Especially about the headphone jack thing. What the fuck was Google doing. I like my Pixel, why didn't they just take that and make it better?Then I thought about it. *How many times had I used my headphone jack in the past year?* Twice. That's it. Two times. I used wireless headphones on the subway and my car connects through bluetooth.  Now people's situation may be different but was I really going to let a feature I used twice dictate my purchase?How about the lack of dual cameras.

I guess it would be nice to have fast **and** wireless charging but if I had to pick between the two it would be the fast charging hands down.Okay, but what about the *no micro SD card thing*. This is where I think Google is making a huge shift in the way we store stuff on our phone. Google photos has unlimited storage, I don't need an SD card for that. My music is all on Spotify. I can get another TB of storage on Google Drive for $99 if I really need it (that's like 8 micro 128 GB Micro USB cards, although it's not instant). I know all of these solutions require data. But in a pinch I can use my [USB flash key chain](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B015QJ0X1U\/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).But that price is killer right? I'm not a fan of giant phones, they don't sit well in my hand so I'm looking at getting the regular version. 64 GB is enough memory. So I'm paying $649. A little steep but the new ~~iPhone 8s~~ iPhone X is $999. It's not even close. Also, Google is buying back my used Pixel for $350. So in the end I'm upgrading my phone to a flagship Android device that I've loved the previous generation of for $299._______________________Hate on it as much as you want but the Pixel 2 is going to work.

However, after successful funding, they removed almost all traces of Google Assistant. Compare the current campaign page and website to archived versions, and you'll note how the only mention of Google Assistant remaining is in the promo video (which is really hard to replace on Kickstarter). In the last days, they have also removed support for Alexa from their website.However, when asked about it in comments and on social media, they state that there were no issues regarding Google Assistant, and that we should stay tuned for updates. **Anker & Google?**  Now, at IFA, [Zolo and Google annonced Mojo](https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/assistant\/your-google-assistant-is-coming-to-new-speakers-and-more\/), one of the first third-party speakers with Google Assistant. A blogpost on Zolo's blog was posted and then taken down again a few days later, as was the [product page for Mojo](https:\/\/zoloaudio.com\/pages\/mojo) (also linked in the Google blog post). Something's going on.**The theory**  After Anker launched their Kickstarter campaign, Google may have contacted them about the Bisto program. As launch was (as is still) slated for October 2017, the lower-cost Zolo Liberty earbuds would make great launch devices for the Bisto program alongside the higher-priced Quiet Comfort II and the new Pixels, also slated for an October launch. Anker agreed and started working on implementing bisto to their hardware, removing earlier mentions of Assistant to keep this a secret. To comply with some sort of bisto guidelines, they have now also removed their standalone Alexa support from the headphones, putting the Liberty+ on par with the Quiet Comfort II.We're pretty sure more there will be multiple Bisto headphones, and the recent leaks of Bose's QC2 have made it clear that [Google won't be building them themselves](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/2017\/09\/06\/google-app-v7-11-beta-suggests-next-android-version-8-1-adds-battery-levels-bisto-headphones-prepares-tweak-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown\/). Besides, it would very much make sense to have some sort wireless earbuds in the bisto family at launch to counter Samsung's IconX and of course Apple's AirPods, given the new Pixels will likely not have a headphone jack.What's your take on this?","228":"3 days in a row now my Nest Mini has unassociated itself with my Google account overnight, this not waking me up and asking me to reset it up in the Google home app when  I ask it to tell me the time And another side note I don't know if it's just me but the past month or so all my Google devices have started to slack in some way or another.

But Google didn't allow me to do the same. I would have been fine if they had simply charged me for one month and reverted me back to my original plan. But no, they said that once it\u2019s canceled, I can\u2019t go back.Honestly, AI and Google One storage are two completely different products\u2014why did they even combine them? That\u2019s not even the main issue, but now they are canceling my previous plan as well.On the phone, I explained everything.

I was all in. It's been a great phone. The only problems I've had are the charge doesn't last quite as long as I would hope and an app that would play audio at random times when the phone wasn't in use (which was fixed relatively fast). Other than that it was the most reliable, easy to use phone I ever had and the photos are great. Like beyond great. This thing takes [amazing photos](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/pixel\/). Even in the long term reviews that have been trickling in this year people are saying it's the best smartphone they've ever used.---------------------**ffwd to the Pixel 2**When I heard about the Pixel 2 I was excited. Then came all the news; There's no SD card, the bezels are huge, it's not called \"Nexus,\" it's too expensive, there's no wireless charging, no dual cameras, there's no bixby button, it's plastic looking, WHERE'S THE HEAD PHONE JACK???I was pissed too. Especially about the headphone jack thing. What the fuck was Google doing. I like my Pixel, why didn't they just take that and make it better?Then I thought about it. *How many times had I used my headphone jack in the past year?* Twice. That's it. Two times. I used wireless headphones on the subway and my car connects through bluetooth.  Now people's situation may be different but was I really going to let a feature I used twice dictate my purchase?How about the lack of dual cameras. Google's claiming the [dual pixel thing](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/pixel-2-is-so-good-it-doesnt-need-dual-cameras-google-says\/) is as good as dual cameras and less clunky. The original Pixel's camera was the best available when it came out. I love what they have created before. I'll give it a shot.Still no wireless charging though. Even back in the day [I jerry-rigged my S3 to have wireless charging](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/this-easy-hack-adds-wireless-charging-to-samsung-galaxy-s3\/), why doesn't the Pixel 2 have it?

You name them. I almost got them all.After today's conference, I never been least excited about the product through my whole journey with them: They keep introducing confusing names changes and new products without improving the features of the older ones: Google home is now called Nest which is different from the thermostat. Google docs was changed several names (Drive then One... I can't keep up with the name changes) but I haven't seen significant change in the features. I have 3 Chromecast ( chrome cast gen 1, 2, and audio), and I'm not sure anymore which one can play stadia (I think there is another newer one).I used to go against Microsoft because they were focusing on the tiny shiny things but not the quality. Ironically I'm seeing the opposite now and I'm more Microsoft Office fan.Is it just me (maybe getting older and less excited about such technology) or Google, and tech companies in general, are losing creativity?I still love you Google, but I don't feel the same love back from you anymore \ud83d\ude2d","233":"As a long time Pixel user, and ProjectFi, back in October, I purchased two Pixel 3 offered under a special initial promotion. I also added a third line (which I did not need), but as a requirement to get $799 in Fi credits, the $15\/month was a no brainer.Three months later, I call Fi customer service to see why my credit has not shown up yet, and I was comforted by the representative that it takes two to three billing cycles after activation, and should appear by February. I call back at the end of February, and I'm thrown in a loop of calls back and forth as the phones were not bought under the same account, the process was not done correctly, etc, etc. This goes on until mid-March when my concern is finally escalated to a senior manager. Now, I'm told that my case will be examined by the escalations team, and there is no timeline on how long this may take. 8 weeks later, I am told that I did not follow the process of ordering correctly, and therefore I do not qualify. To ensure anything like this does not happen, I explained that I ordered and cancelled to make sure all phones were ordered under the master account, and during the order process, it only allowed me to order one phone at a time. The third line even shows that only one call was made to ensure it was activated but was only added to take advantage of the promotion.For being an avid Google fan and product user, this was very disappointing to hear and for the lack of support given, not just to me now, but to several I hear today. I would have even taken a credit for the unnecessary third line added, and would just forget about the promotion, as I upgrad either way every year. Because of this experience, I would NOT use GoogleFi service. I am forced to port my number to a different carrier today...","234":"I used to love everything about Google. Eagerly waiting to try out whatever new product was about to be launched. If Google did something, they'd do it 20x better than anyone else. Fast forward 10 years and I'm disappointed more and more everyday.Seems to me, instead of issues getting fixed, more are introduced. Lists below sorted by my frequency of usage. Google Search: Every since June 2017 update, search results are wildly inaccurate.  It seems like the word match sensitivity has been turned up +40%. Search for anything now takes 4x longer. I couldn't even find lists like this one from other people about issues they are having with Google products. Google Keyboard \/ Gboard: Ever since the name change to Gboard. Thought I was going crazy. I have next word prediction turned off. Yet as I'm typing it changes correctly spelled words into different words. As I'm typing this, it keeps trying to change \"word\" into \"work.\"Google Hangouts: Bugs never get fixed. No search button. Convo history sometimes only shows 3-4 weeks back. Stickers and emojis are more important I guess. And how many communication apps do we need now? Allo. Duo. Hangouts Meet. Hangouts Chat. Messaging. Hangouts. Google Captcha: How many cars or street signs do I need to identify? It never ends. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/assholedesign\/comments\/63duqsChrome: Windows- Rediculous RAM usage. Settings screen is now difficult to use. Android- Allows sites to access vibrator. Eg. Scareware sites that vibrate my phone until I close Chrome.Google Now: Can't identify songs. What happened to personal AI \/ cloud search? \"ok Google, show me documents in Drive sent from Doug\"YouTube: Web app no issues. Android app always complains of connectivity issues that resolve after clicking retry. Google Music: Randomly switches out explicit songs in my playlists for clean versions. Toggle in settings doesn't do anything. Songs and entire albums disappear. (Licensing issue?)Chromecast: Casting randomly freezes. No connection issues. I have to stop cast and restart it. Google On Hub: Can only be configured through app. No web app or interfere to adjust settings.Android Wear: Ever since 2.0 version- 1) Ok Google takes forever to initialize. 2) Can disable incoming call screen. Watch buzzes with my phone. For now, 99% of the time, my phone is in Do Not Disturb. And that solves this issue. 3) DND not linked. No option to change preference.AdWords Express: Says my ads are active. Account is in good standing. Ads are not appearing and stats reflect this. Haven't bothered to look into further.Google product forums: I have to sign in to my Google account to view posts now? Allo: In order to send and receive messages on the web app, my phone has to be on and connected to the internet. Allo web app uses my phone as a proxy. Wtf. Nexus: Loved the 5. Loved the 6. Bought a 6P. 4 months later, green line on side of screen. Never dropped. Common issue. I didn't bother with a warranty claim. Not worth my time. Android Pay and Google Wallet: Stopped using couple years back. Gave up trying to add my cards. These products seem dead. WHAT WORKS WELL FOR MEAndroid: I have gripes here and there, but everything works fine. Google Voice: Most consistent and reliable service to date. Occasional choppy call. Otherwise, no issues ever. I use it as my main #. No one knows my real cell #. Been doing that since Google Voice launched. Spam filtering is so nice.Gmail: No complaints. Works well.Inbox: No complaints. Works well.Google Maps \/ Navigation: Used to take me to wrong places despite address was correct. Sometimes it will route me through areas I cannot access like gated private roads. For the most part, no issues. Google Calendar: It's a calendar service. Hard to screw that up? Keep: It's a note taking service. I even downloaded the Keep chrome app for my PC. Simple enough to not break?","235":"Hello all,I'm a giant fan of Google and their products, whether they be digital or physical. As such, my home is full of Google Home speakers and nest hubs. As you may suspect, I also own a Google Pixel 4XL, but this critique equally extends to all Google Pixel Phones and possibly all Android Phones where the Assistant is installed and used. When attempting to use Assistant at home with the hotword detection, it often gets picked up by my surrounding speakers. Some times this is okay, like for queries; for things like texting or calling someone, it is very frustrating. My speaker will collect the command and then inform me that the action cannot be done since the device doesn't support it. I can be holding the phone in my hand and it will do this. In an ideal world, it would be nice to be able to state a command and Google Assistant route it to the device capable of executing that command. Like, let's say my device in charging in the other room and I'm near a speaker. \"Okay Google, send a text to John saying: 'Hey be there in 15' \", and the speaker routing that to my phone. Or getting a text and asking for Google to read it and respond, same for phone calls. &#x200B;This is my biggest critique of Google Devices so far. My favorite feature is, ironically, shackled due to having it on more than just my phone.","236":"I bought the Pixel 3 to replace my dying Pixel 2. Funny enough, the Pixel 2 had enough of an issue that they told me to RMA that phone too. I found a great deal on the Pixel 3, brand new from Walmart, and decided to just replace the device completely.20 days later, the brand new Pixel 3 crapped out. [Screen went to total shit](https:\/\/ibb.co\/bPPPD26)[Basically seizure-inducing](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/sizzlingqueasyfieldspaniel)All just a few days after the Walmart return period concluded. I went back to Walmart and after seeing the video, the manager agreed to an exchange. Turns out, there's no Pixel 3s in stock anymore - four different Walmarts, all zero stock.My only choice was too contact Google, and after reading all the reviews about their customer service here, I was not very excited to do it. Contacted them, walked through the same bullshit basic steps again and they said \"yes after verifying your IMEI, you have an in-warranty device and we'll RMA it\".Great but guess what? No advanced replacement. Only devices bought directly from Google qualify for this, despite the fact that they verified the IMEI, verified that it has warranty, verified that it's broken. Despite the fact that I offered to have the hold put on my credit card without issue. Traditional exchange only - send the device in, wait for replacement.Well what choice did I have? I RMA'd it via standard exchange, told 5 - 10 days for a replacement. It took them THREE tries to get my NAME right on the address label, and it's a common name \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0fWhat did Google send me? A standard delivery label to ship it from one coast of Canada to the other - not one-day, not two-day, not even expedited. A minimum, one week shipping process. And this is in a country that ACTUALLY HAS GOOGLE KIOSKS IN BEST BUY \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f wtf GoogleWell it arrives at the Google facility, more than halfway across the country, days pass and I hear nothing. I call Google and they advise me, \"it's processing after which it will take another 5 - 10 days to receive your replacement\". Wait what?! Are you fucking serious? This isn't some big product you need to examine, it's a damn phone!So here I am, using my broken Pixel 2, which I also need to replace through this crap process all over again. Unbelievable, no wonder people choose Apple. What a complete shitshow. Tl;Dr - Google, you really shouldn't make consumer products if you don't have the customer support to back it up.","237":"I know, probably no one will read this wall of text, but I need to get it out.**Backstory**:  I have been using google since about 1999.  I use gmail, google voice, used to use wallet, etc.  I have owned multiple Google phones.  My current device is a Nexus 6P.  I love it.  My wife however has always used Samsung products.  I finally convinced her to buy a Pixel after she (again) dropped her phone and cracked the screen.  I convinced her of the awesomeness of no bloatware, quicker updates, and the great all in one experience.  **Story**: So, [I ordered a 128gb very silver Pixel XL on March 29, 2017 for my wife.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/4bzfsCs)  When I ordered it, there was no indication that it would take almost 2 months to be delivered.  Expected arrival was between May 10-12.  WTF...  Whatever, waiting for the best phone currently on the market sucks, but it is what it is.  We'll wait...  [It finally arrived on May 1st](http:\/\/imgur.com\/bNhDb59).. WHOO HOO... almost 2 weeks earlier than expected.  After using it a few days, my wife noticed a few dead pixels right in the middle of the screen.  She's not a technophile,  so she was worried and confused.  She confessed to me.  I said no biggie, we'll just do an RMA and have it replaced.  I'm a lazy husband, I admit it.  I finally got around to contacting Google on May 9th.  This is where the nightmare begins.  When speaking with customer service they said \"No big deal.  \"We'll send you an email with the shipping stuff, you click the link, then buy another phone, and we'll ship it out to you, and refund\/remove the hold when we receive the old phone.\"   I explained that I can't afford another $1,034.16 charge on my card.  I literally do not have that much money or credit at this point.  I just want to ship the original back to google and then Google can ship another one when they get the broken one.  \"Sure, of course\" he says, \"please hold.\"   A few minutes later he comes back and says there's a problem with the system.  I'll be receiving the emails within an hour.  \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" he says.  No, of course not.  I'll be waiting for the email.   Many hours later, [I received the email](http:\/\/imgur.com\/qdPSfQZ):> Thank you for contacting Google Support. > First I have to apologize as I have told you that we'll be processing the RMA for the Standard Exchange but it seems we are encountering issues about processing the said RMA. But don't worry, I have escalated this case to our support team we'll process the RMA. We are going to send you a response via email or contact you within 24-48 hours about the RMA details. > Thanks!> Allen   > The Google Support Team   3 days later, I still had no email, no call from Google.  This part is hard to prove, obviously.  But, they know they didn't call.  So, I called Google back on Friday, May 12th.  I get the same damn word for word script.  I explain the situation, he says \"yes yes sir, I will fix this.  I see the problem.  Okay, I will fix this, send you an email, you return the phone, and we'll send another.\"   So I wait again.  No email, no call.  So, I call again on Sunday.  Finally, another person, same script.  Same shit.  [I get an email though this time after getting off the phone.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/2Q3IC2l)  That link takes me to a page to order another phone.... with the same charges, which I can't afford.  So, I ship the phone back on Tuesday with the provided return labels.  Now, they have received the phone, but can't send another because their system won't allow it.  After about 15 phone calls and multiple emails, 2 and a half weeks, I finally got someone to just refund my purchase entirely.   That was this past wednesday, May 24th.  I finally received the refund today (May 26th).  I spoke with another rep, she said I would get a $75 credit in an email after I ordered a new phone.... I ordered a new phone, still no email with a credit... <sigh>They effectively wasted 2 months waiting for the phone.  2 weeks trying to get a replacement or a refund.  about 6 hours on the phone, and about 30 emails.  [Here's just a few.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/Vc1rnTw)This has done nothing to convince my wife that Google is a good company.  She even threatened me with switching to IPhones.  After such an ordeal, I have backed up all my Google stuff onto other services, because I was about to have to initiate a chargeback.  I can say right now, I'm not sure if I will ever order another Google phone ever again.  Like my wife, I'm *almost* tempted to move to Apple.

The termination came as a complete shock because the email mentioned strong indications that my account was related to or sharing information with other developer accounts already terminated.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rcti9o30nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf5719c5565528ed86afb74754e224ad2db0e370After a long period of confusion trying to understand the problem, which wasn't clear enough for me, I had only two options: clicking on a \"yes\" button that I didn't respect Google rules and giving explanations, or clicking on \"no\" with no possibility to add any commentary or text. It was illogical for someone not understanding the situation and facing \"strong indications\" to simply click \"no.\" I decided to start the appeal process, where I explained my shock, confusion, and misunderstanding of the situation under the \"yes\" button because I expected a high quality of support, as the support team claimed to be understanding to the maximum possible extent.A few hours later, I received an email from Google confirming that they reviewed my case and upheld their shocking and unexpected decision to terminate my account.Later that day, I remembered a recent discussion I had on WhatsApp with a developer I had recently met. I had given him my WhatsApp number to communicate with me. This was strange and incomprehensible if it was the reason for the termination, and if the developer accounts mentioned in the email were referencing this one individual person, whose development history I did not know.In a state of shock and confusion, I mentioned meeting this person and providing him with my phone number, explaining the reason why I did that. A few hours later, I received confirmation from Google that my account was still terminated. These automated responses left me lost, with no one to discuss the situation with.I wondered if any similar reasons could be behind the termination, and I mentioned similar cases of people I had recently contacted.I sent multiple appeals, each time explaining that I didn\u2019t understand the situation and that it was really hurtful to lose my personal account unexpectedly and without tolerance. I clicked on the \"yes\" button because it suggested that clicking it could lead to tolerance.There was no response and no consideration from Google, which was really demoralizing.A few months later, I discovered Reddit posts mentioning the exact email I received, explaining that the reason for termination was that Google was accusing me of either creating my account or someone helping me manage my account. I was really mad and disappointed\u2014not only because these were false accusations, but also because **I found a better explanation of the problem from an unknown person on the internet rather than from the support team**, which was supposed to help me and provide guidance, especially since I had mentioned my misunderstanding of the situation.So I recontacted the support team, explaining that I found the explanation of their email outside of Google links on a Reddit post. I pointed out that their email wasn\u2019t precise enough and that their explanatory links were misleading, only referring to errors within my applications, and that I had a reason to be a victim of misunderstanding.No answer from Google.I kept appealing for months, explaining my misunderstanding and referring to the developer person I had met, clarifying that our meeting was casual and that I gave him my phone number for a reason I explained. I provided as much detail and evidence of my innocence as possible, including proof of solo working, reasons why I had a personal developer account, and a history of good faith developing. I also explained that I clicked on \"yes\" out of confusion and because I wanted better understanding from the support team.Among the evidence of solo working I provided were:1. All of the graphics are in my search history.2. I was developing and testing every update using my personal phone, and sometimes my brother's.3. I used my personal computer for development and research.4. The source codes were my own style.5. All of the activity on my account was confirmed while I was at home.6. I was a previous developer of a dynamic website. I created my personal developer account exactly at the end of hosting my site, focusing on Android development instead of web development.7. I was publishing my applications on different stores under my full name.8. I provided proof that I was responsible for translating my applications.9. I shared a link I used for organizing my work daily.10. I provided evidence of solo efforts in completing some education applications.11. I explained the existence of some applications on my phone to complete some testing, like the Amazon App Store and Samsung App Store.12. I used Firebase and Admob, which should prove the analysis of solo work.13. I managed my social media account solely.14. I explained the research I did every time I had to use new software, like when I started using Unity 3D for making games.15. I showed that my applications improved in quality over time due to personal efforts and knowledge.16. I pointed out the absence of friendship with that person on different social media accounts.17. I explained that the other person was interested in his own business and not in mine.18. I clarified that each person was in a different city for years and that we were always far from each other.I discussed many hypotheses, trying to explain that Google's decision was a mistake.I kept repeating and explaining that the meeting was casual, but Google never considered my explanations, until one day: **February 2, 2023**, when I explained technically what had already been said. I explained the 10-minute difference: when the other person saved my phone number on his phone, I wasn\u2019t connected at home, and it took me 10 minutes to come back home from the place of our first meeting, where I then logged in directly and responded to the WhatsApp discussion.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/32utquz3nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27acd4e481abe3bf13ce717bcdc7b5c0badb871aAnd then, Google reopened a new ticket for me, confirming the decision was based on the phone number on WhatsApp. However, after 5 days, they reaffirmed their decision to terminate my account, still citing strong indications. Not only this, but I was the reason why Google made \"Updates to Google Play Terms of Service\" and sent an email to millions of users on February 8, 2023, mentioning \"Increased clarity and certainty\" and \"Improved readability.\"their response for me was:\"After carefully reviewing your appeal, we're unable to reinstate your Google Play Developer account.**We can confirm that we have found strong indications that your Developer Account is sharing information with, or is related to, other Developer accounts that have been terminated from Google Play for violating Google\u2019s policies.** As we previously explained, in order to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems and putting our users at risk in the process, we can\u2019t share the reasons we\u2019ve concluded that one account is related to another.\"I was so frustrated, feeling wronged, alone, and immorally treated. I had confirmation that I was wronged and that Google had misjudged me, but they didn\u2019t acknowledge their mistake and did not consider giving me back my account.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bhu16mf7nsad1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=de03ae75bb794662b4fdf32719faa309fe3b5bbcI kept appealing and appealing for months without giving up until **May 3, 2023**, when Google reopened my ticket and made the first deep analysis of my situation. This took a month, much longer than the first analysis made on February 8, 2023. This not only proved that I was mistreated and not considered for a long period, but also showed that Google pretended to have clearly checked my case and to have evidence that did not exist or had just vanished.Unfortunately, after the deep analysis, Google confirmed their decision again. This time they reopened a special ticket for me on **June 7, 2023**, where I felt I had priority over other tickets and could appeal four times per day, but I still didn\u2019t understand why my ticket wasn\u2019t resolved.At this period, I think **my case and feedback were taken seriously to improve service quality at Google Play**. I kept asking them to verify my identity when I provided my ID card, and asked them to consider my case to prevent me from making another account if I didn\u2019t respect the rules. They didn\u2019t accept my appeal, but they started asking for identity verification from everyone else. They also started asking for more information to help them decide whether to terminate an account for being related or not, such as if you were a previous developer for a website, it is unlikely that your current developer account would be associated with someone else if they registered your phone number.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wir70xmcnsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd94986449b6e06643bd3d1c2627304885bb8743So I kept appealing and appealing again and again, but there was no resolution even though I was telling the truth.I also explained that my misunderstanding was based on the imprecision of their email, and that I thought my applications were reported by users for being accused of spying and sharing information, which could have been caused by my accidental copying and pasting of source code that allowed this. I just wanted to discuss the situation because at the time my account was terminated, I received some false accusations from users that my applications were spying on them, which I totally deny.Now i only receive the copy past message:\"As explained in our previous emails, I am not able to provide any more details or a better answer to your question. I made sure to include all the information available to me.\"but they never asked me any question or to provide any document or information.During years of solo developing, of course, I had a few minor personal mistakes, but all my work was solo and not related to any other person.To this day, my personal account is still terminated. I can\u2019t monetize my applications on other stores using Admob, and my AdSense account was also terminated due to a false accusation not based on any evidence. This prevents me from monetizing my YouTube channel too.Thank you for reading.","240":"Last June, I pre-ordered Chipolo Points and Card and I finally received them a few days ago. Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: \"find nearby,\" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11). The Find My Device app on my ereader shows the Google tags, but they're not present on my Chromebook\u2019s Find My Device app.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don\u2019t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them. If you have Nest devices in the house they do help locate your Google tags which is great as they say \u201cyour keys were last seen at 9:10 near bedroom display\u201d, I\u2019m going to guess that with Google TVs acting as hubs in Google Home soon this will also help find your devices\/Google tags.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don\u2019t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them.

For example, Chromebooks could totally be added to Google's Find My Device network. Apple users can track their Macbooks with the Find My network, so it'd be awesome if Google could do something like that for Chromebooks and even Windows laptops. Judging how someone got Quickshare on MacOS, we\u2019ll probably see someone make it possible for Linux and Windows later on.","241":"Google has started to act weird, Right? Don\u2019t believe me? Here are five reasons that made me think so,Hurried Release of Android NNo one ever expected (may be wanted) the update so early. Marshmallow was new then and not even 7% of the total android devices had it running on them. There was a huge leap in performance, when Google released Android Kitkat followed by very unique Material design language with Android Lollipop. Though some people may argue that they had better security on Android Marshmallow and Nougat, most people are dissatisfied with what the updates offered.Shifting away from the rootsAny developer who had developed apps for Gingerbread would have read a design guideline, proclaiming them not to add tabs to the bottom as it would \u201ckill the uniqueness of Android\u201d. Now you can see the opposite of it. Bottom tabs in YouTube, Google+, and Hangouts etc. In future, most android apps would look like the ones you see now in iOS.The new advertising strategyIn the past few months, Google has started to advertise its products on its Homepage. There were one-liners for Duo, Allo and the Pixel phones running on the face of the internet. Though there were advertisements for the Nexus series, the ads of Pixel are everywhere, on facebook, youtube, hulu,sponsors movies on TV channels, third-party websites and other forms of paid advertising media.Pricing the PixelsThough Android phone have not been praised for its reliability or stability, they are always at the top in terms of affordability and functionality. The Pixel XL (32GB) was a whopping $769 deal, that costs only $285 to make. This is a huge premium to pay for acquiring a Google phone. So what was the reason behind this? Google priced the phones \u00a0at the peak, not to earn super profits, but to declare its entry in the hardware segment to its competitors (Apple and Samsung)\u00a0Ignoring its true fansPeople who wanted the pure android experience brought the Nexus phones, believing that they would stay up to date in the software segment. Google did give updates and the market value of the phones did not plummet. With Pixel, Google ditched Nexus series. Now the nexus enthusiasts have no place to lament. As the year 2016 ends, so does the updates for Nexus phones. This adversely affects its resale value.What do you think so? Have I missed any? Post it in comments.For more : yougeek.wordpress.com","242":"There was an interesting podcast with Eric Schmidt that had some real nice stories reaching back to the early days at Google. The lessons Eric learned from Bill Campbell were personally especially inspiring. I've summarized some of the topics discussed and extracted some quotes from Eric that I thought was interesting. (Original headlines are from Tim's blog)&#x200B;**Why did Eric begin his undergrad in architecture and shift to electrical engineering?**>Software didn't really exist at the time. Computer science didn't really exist as a field. I had been programming when I was in high school. It was a rare event at the time. When I meet some 15 year old boy that has three computers and is a gamer and sits at home with all sorts of screens all night. That was me back then without the computers, without the gaming, without the screens. So when I went to college, I actually applied as an architect, because I had studied architecture in high school, I liked it. But I wasn't a very good architect, but I was quite a much better engineer, and when I got to freshman year, I was a good enough programmer that I skipped the freshman year programming. And that's the the hallmark of a flexible college program is they organized around my ability. So I was what we now call an early developed nerd, although the term wasn't even used back then.&#x200B;**Eric talks about working at Sun Microsystems in 1983 and contrasts the world of electronics then with today.**>So one of the things to think about when you look at your phone or your Macintosh or your PC, is that there were whole waves of predecessors of these things that were impossibly slower, and it impossibly more expensive. But had those things not occurred, we wouldn't have gotten to where you are today. So each generation builds this product that's impossibly difficult. So Sun managed to build what was impossible at the time, which was a one megahertz processor, a one megabyte memory, and a one megabit screen. Today, your phone has a gigabit that is 1000 or more times more than that.&#x200B;**How did Eric wind up at Sun and who does he consider his mentors from those days?**>In my story, what happened was I was at Berkeley, and my best friend was a brilliant computer scientist named Bill Joy, who was the chief programmer, much of the technology of the time, he did much of the early internet programming. And when I was at Xerox, I worked with another brilliant computer scientist named Butler Lampson. So I had the best, smartest mentors in the technical sense. So I had a choice of staying and doing research. But I really wanted to go into a company. My friend Bill had founded Sun Microsystems, which was this technical platform at the time. And I showed up.  The technology is such that 30 years earlier, that knowledge base survives in the heads of the people who were there, and in the legacy of the intellectual property that they invented.&#x200B;**Has Eric always been known as a clear communicator, or is it something he developed over time?**>I don't know, to be honest, I'm just this is who I am. I think what happens is that I'm a very logical thinker, and I'm a good explainer. So logical thinker plus good explainer, is how it works.&#x200B;**What did Eric learn about the executive arts at this point in his career, and how did they differ from the way things are done today?**>It's important to say right now that today, we know much more how to run successful tech companies than we did in the 1980s and 90s. The formula, the learning, the standards of excellence are far far more honed over the last 20 years of executives working in each other companies and things like that. That's part of why things happen so fast in our industry. But at the time, we didn't really know how to professional really software in this new space, we didn't really have open source software established as a principal, we didn't really know how to sell it.&#x200B;**When you\u2019re teaching, learning, and doing business in uncharted territory, sometimes you\u2019ve got to write the reference material.**>What's interesting is a lot of the things that I'm talking about are still not written down from the engineering science perspective, how do you manage a large software project, I'm not aware of a defining book that describes that. There's plenty of technical books about aspects of software, but the culture of software is still evolving.&#x200B;**On the seemingly everywhere venture capitalist John Doerr and how small Silicon Valley is \u2014 and was, especially in its early days \u2014 despite how vast it might appear to outsiders.**>John was this mythical figure that I met when I first joined Sun. He seemed everywhere. And he was one of these prodigies at sales, he had worked at a company called Compaq. And he'd been so successful as a salesperson that he had joined Kleiner Perkins, which became the most successful venture firm in history.  I learned a lot from John, because he had a pretty simple rule, which is that what do venture capitalists do? They help the management team, they recruit management team, and they raise money.  So the world is much smaller than it seems. If you're an outsider looking at our world, somebody might think it this vast world. But to me, it seems like about 100 people and they all know each other, they've all been on each other's boards. They were all working together toward a common goal. I've since learned that this is how industries develop.&#x200B;**Eric\u2019s 30-second history of Silicon Valley.**>The history of the valley was that it started with the Fairchild Corporation, and then in late 1950s, and then a group of eight left, they were called the traitorous eight, and they went to Intel and a number of other companies. And they were funded by this guy named Arthur Rock. And he was the only venture capitalist as I interviewed him for something else I was doing. He's now elderly and retired, but incredibly impressive. And I said, well, what was venture like back then? And he said, well, we were the only one, so we would just wait until we decided. How long would you make people wait? Oh, six weeks, eight weeks, we were the only money in town. And he had been clever enough to figure out the limited partner structure which fuel this industry. Once the business started going, the fact that there was not a non compete, meant that people all lived essentially with each other, right? They went to each other's parties, they were in marriages, if you will. Everybody knew each other. And from that strength, they lifted all of us.&#x200B;**Does Eric believe Silicon Valley is a unique, non-recurring phenomenon? What would it take to replicate its positive characteristics for entrepreneurship elsewhere?**>The thing Silicon Valley has going for it are, at least historically, abundance of land, great opportunity, plenty of money, 2 tremendous technical universities in Berkeley and Stanford, this history of entrepreneurial in nature of things, a sense of going higher than others. This is the moon shots versus roof shots. There are a set of people who also believe that the nature of California is part of it. There was a book written that some of this happened, this is before my time, because of the anti-war activities in the 60s and LSD and so forth. And that the kind of crazy thinkers of the time again, before me, ended up here. And that also helped program the area. So they would think broader or higher. I don't know if that's true or not. In order to replicate Silicon Valley, you're going to need to have leading universities, lots of money and time. We have evidence that Cambridge, Massachusetts has done this. If you look at biotech, they've clearly built a model very similar. We have evidence that New York is on its way. It looks like there's enough money, enough people enough universities there, obviously a great draw of the city. And we have evidence that Beijing has the same feeling. When you go to Beijing, you get that same feeling of crazy startups. So those are a few. Tel Aviv is another one. We need more competitors than the ones I just named. We need 20 competitors 30 competitors 40 competitors.&#x200B;**John Doerr\u2019s role in introducing Eric to Google.**>I had known John for very, very long time because he was on the board of Sun when I was there for 14 years. And I happened to be at a fundraiser a political fundraiser at John Chambers house, who was the CEO of Cisco. And John came up to me, that is John Doerr came up to me, says you should check out Google.&#x200B;**Eric sets the scene of his interview with Larry Page and Sergey Brin.**>And they start to question me, and they're very interested in what I'm doing at Novell, I was a CEO at the time. And they had decided that what I was doing at Novell made no sense at all. And they wanted to make sure that I knew this. So this went on for an hour and a half. And it was rough. I mean, they were very sharp. And I remember as I walked out of the building, thinking, boy, I haven't had that good of an argument in years. The thing we were talking about were technically called proxy caches. They accelerate the internet and they believed at that time that you didn't need them, and I believe that you did. After we purchased YouTube, the way we handled the extraordinary growth of YouTube, is we built proxy caches. So what I like to say is they were right. And then I was right.&#x200B;**During his Google interview\/argument, what clued Eric in to the fact that he was dealing with atypical founders?**>Because they're brilliant. And because they are so technically current, they can ask the really hard questions.&#x200B;**How did Larry and Sergey assess Eric as a potential leader, and what qualities inEric did John Doerr see as a complement to those of the Google founders?**>I'm not sure. They had interviewed for about 18 months before me. And they like to spend a lot of time with their people, their candidates, so they would go on vacation for the day or go skiing with a candidate or so forth to to judge cultural fit. It became fairly quickly clear that I would be a good fit. Because we had, although we were different in age, we had had the same faculty members, 18 years apart. And we had a very similar technical background.&#x200B;**In what ways did Eric lend his \u201cadult supervision\u201d to manage the brilliant chaos of early Google and spur its growth?**>My understanding is that the 2 venture capitalists, when they had invested, wanted to bring in somebody who had operating experience, this came to be turned adult supervision.&#x200B;**Eric explains Sergey\u2019s 70-20-10 model and how it\u2019s been applied at Google.**>So Sergei, we had an off-site, and with the whole management team, and I still remember. Sergei got up on the board, and he did some math. He's a brilliant mathematician. And at the end of the math, he said, the right answer is 70, 20, 10. 70%, on your core business, 20% on adjacent or nearby things, and 10%, on wild bets. The reason I highlight this is I believe that you can systematically manage innovation. You'll never be able to pick which of the 50 ideas are going to be the next billion dollar corporation. It's too hard. But you can manage it so that when you get these shots on goal, you identify them, you get a chance to fund them, you look at them, you can systematized innovation, even if you can't completely predict it.&#x200B;**What Eric believes a company should focus on to keep growing pains from becoming an equally scalable distraction.**>One of the things to know is that when you're in a high growth situation, you've got to focus on the right things. It's very, very easy to get distracted. In a high growth scenario, the most right thing is to make your product better. In other words, product product product product. Because if you have a very strong product, it's relatively easy to sell. It's relatively easy with a very strong product to make money from it, it's relatively easy to recruit people to work on it, if you have a weak product, it's very different.&#x200B;**What Eric considers his most important job as a CEO.**>I can tell you that as the CEO, that my most important thing to do is to make the velocity of interactions faster.&#x200B;**What did Google\u2019s weekly meeting schedule look like initially, and how has it adapted over time? Is it what Eric would consider ideal?**>If I had my own way, the way I would run the companies, I would meet every day at four. Because operationally, things happen every day, and they can be quick.&#x200B;**Who was Bill Campbell, and why did Eric, together with Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle, write Trillion Dollar Coach about him?**>Bill Campbell, is in at least in our opinion, is the most successful coach in world history. He was the primary coach for Google in its rise, he was also the primary coach for Apple in its rise, along with a host of other companies. And the sum of the companies that he has coached have now exceeded more than $2 trillion of value.&#x200B;**Why does coaching matter in the business world, and what made Bill such an exceptionally gifted coach?**>If you go to a company, as you get to higher and higher, you're dealing with very sophisticated, very educated, very experienced, seasoned professionals that know what to do. Well, in fact, not only do they not know what to do, but they're all caught up in their own politics and their own egos, and they disagree with each other. And they want to make their mark, and they want credit, and so forth. And a coach sorts that out in the same sense that a coach of a football team or a basketball team does. It's the same principle but applied to business.&#x200B;**What were Bill\u2019s opinions about starting and running meetings?**>So for example, meetings tend to be unstructured. So his advice was, make a list of things you want to talk about. And then start the meeting, not with that list, unless you're in crisis. But start with trip reports. And because people were traveling, people would spend 5 or 10 minutes, we would often use Google Maps and show I went from here to here to here. But then that allowed people to conversationally, explain what they were worried about, or what they had observed. This works incredibly well, because it humanized the organization. The thing I learned from Bill, and I'm used to running fast, and I'm used to baba blah, is this good or bad? That's fine, goodbye. Right? That doesn't work. It doesn't work for junior employees, and it doesn't work for senior employees. They're human too. So if you're going to manage people, or leave them, leave the whole person. How are you? How is your family? How was your operation? What are you worried about? What are your better at life? What do you think about the political situation? What do you think about the Grand Prix and the racecars? Whatever it takes to get people to be humanized turns out to be key.&#x200B;**The key difference between a coach and a manager.**>The difference between a coach and a manager, this is important, is a manager will say, Tim, please do this. A coach will say Tim, what do you want to do? And then he'll carefully guide you to what you want to be to what the collective good is. That function is critical.&#x200B;**How would Bill facilitate solutions when decision makers didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye?**>So the rule we had about meetings was that there was a decision maker in the room. But the decision maker in the room did not make the decision in the room until after other people had been heard. Even if he couldn't get them to a common agreement, the fact that they had participated in the discussion and had been heard, and saw the decision being made, allowed them to overcome their embarrassment or envy or unhappiness that they had lost, to go back and fight for a win.&#x200B;**When Google went public in 2004, Bill recommended that Eric step aside as chairman, but made sure he would be reinstated as chairman later. What was his thinking behind this, and how did he pitch it to Eric?**>There was a complicated discussion about independence involving dual class, sort of a technical matter. And they had come to this idea. And I thought, Well, I've done a good job, right. I felt, I took it personally, I took it wrong. It was my pride that that got to me. And so he immediately recognized that this was a pride problem. Right? So he said, Look, I get it, I understand it. I think this is best for the company. And I, in the next year, I'll work to make this reverse in the right way. And his credibility with me by then, this is we started working three years earlier, was so high that I naturally said, Okay.&#x200B;**Though Eric was initially resistant to the idea of having a coach, here\u2019s what happened during his first meeting with Bill to convince him otherwise.**>Once I sat down with Bill, I knew I needed a coach. And the way I knew was that he had been working with another executive who worked for me, at the time, inside of Google. This other executive had a health problem, a very bad cancer problem. And he did not, he Bill, did not tell me. And I thought, if Bill wouldn't tell me that, then Bill must be able to keep confidentialness. He must be a person who is going to be on my team, keep secrets of the company, protect us and so forth.&#x200B;**How did Bill Campbell walk the delicate line between simultaneously helping Google and Apple \u2014 and being so trusted by both?**>Bill was not involved in the product, the product decisions as much as he was in the coaching. And he was careful not to cross the boundaries.&#x200B;**What was Bill Campbell\u2019s secret for accurately sniffing out BS when people weren\u2019t being honest with him, and what were the consequences of such dishonesty if discovered?**>I think, for one thing, he had just massive experience doing this. And so you get really good at checking it. But remember, he also had many, many sources.&#x200B;**As Bill reportedly told Chegg\u2019s Dan Rosensweig, \u201cI don\u2019t take cash, I don\u2019t take stock, and I don\u2019t take shit.\u201d So how was he compensated? What were his primary motivations?**>He explained that he had done really well in his previous job. And this was his give back to the industry. Right, he wanted to do this. And he didn't want to be confused by money. He wanted to work with the people on the principles that he cared about.&#x200B;**As someone who was always trying to find the right people for the right problems, how did he handle firing the wrong people when things didn\u2019t work out?**>Because he had high credibility, even had high credibility with people who were in the process of losing their jobs. And so he would go and say \"Look, this is not working out, and I will help you in your next role.\" And that made an enormous difference. Which of course he did.&#x200B;**How Bill became part of \u201cthe fabric\u201d at Google \u2014 and Apple \u2014 and facilitated conversations between the two in a way no one else could.**>He was very helpful when there began to be tensions between Apple and Google. And because he knew both sides, he would sit there. There were serious disputes between Steve and some of the Google executives over some of the issues in Android vs. iPhone, for example. And those disputes had to do with who could do what and intellectual property and those kinds of things. He got people to talk to each other, they wouldn't have otherwise been able to speak. So there's a case where having credibility with both groups was extremely helpful.&#x200B;**What Eric tries to incorporate into his own life from Bill\u2019s Saturday morning routine.**>His rule was that on Saturday mornings when you wake up, when it's typically quiet. That's the time to sit down and actually think about what happened in the week. Go through everything and get yourself organized. What's your week, like? What's your month, like? And take however long you take to think just in your own head? Am I using my time the most effectively?**What does a typical morning look like for Eric?**>When I'm in one place for a while, yeah, I typically get up and you know, eat something. Although not recently, I guess I've tried. I'm now trying intermittent fasting, see if that makes a difference.&#x200B;**What does Eric hope to gain(or lose) by intermittent fasting?**>There's medical arguments, they're not a fact, that we evolved as hunter gatherers where we had relatively low amounts of food for long periods of time. So fasting was part of being a hunter gatherer, and that our bodies are in fact healthier and better when they eat they're not continuously grazing. And so there's a whole school of thought that says that the best thing to do is to not eat for like 16 hours, and then eat lunch or dinner, or just a dinner or things like that.&#x200B;**What book does Eric gift the most, and why?**>The Better Angels of Our Nature&#x200B;**Does Eric have any favorite failures or challenges that set the stage for later successes?**>For me, the the key moment in my professional career was the decision to go to Novell from Sun. And then the decision to leave Novell. And when I was in Novell, which was a hardcore turn around, a difficult business, lots of problems. That's where a lot of the skills that I had not developing when I was at Sun were developed. You don't really know how a good leader you are until you face a really hard challenge. My hobby is airplane flying. And I had been training in a small jet, and jet training, because it's life and death. They really push you to make decisions and take command. And for me the jet training, at one point, they had a copilot, and they told the copilot to be incredibly unhelpful, without telling me that, in order to train me to take command in a difficult situation in the simulator.&#x200B;**Has Eric\u2019s exposure to the arts developed his intuition in a way that\u2019s been useful toward making hyper analytical business decisions?**>I think when you have a hyper analytical person, which I am, and many people in my industry are, you can be tone deaf. And anything that you can do to increase your understanding, if you're like me, of how people are going to react to things, how people will perceive emotionally, what you're doing is helpful.&#x200B;**What would Bill Campbell have considered \u201csuccess?\u201d**>So he was a principled person who had high integrity. He expected it from others, and he thought that a successful life was one well lived that were consistent with those principles.&#x200B;**What would Eric\u2019s billboard say?**>Software and analytical thinking&#x200B;Specific cuts from the podcasts can be listened [here](https:\/\/podcut.co\/episode\/tim-ferriss-show\/eric-schmidt)","243":"Google's recent event felt overly focused on AI, which while promising, doesn't yet revolutionize the user experience.While the AI features on the Pixel 9 Pro are impressive, they're locked behind a premium price tag and the coolest features like Gemini Live are behind a subscription wall. The camera and video improvements are welcome (it is about time) finally focusing on users pain, but they don't justify the overall cost of the device.  $200 increase over the Pixel 8 Pro, compered to the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1099 (As they are the same size despite the added XL).The Pixel Watch 3 offers some nice upgrades mostly in the display area and optional bigger size, but again, the AI features seem incremental. The real disappointment is with the battery life, it would be nice to see Google focused more on os efficiency and increase battery life to at least 3 days, something users have been craving for a long time. I do give a thumbs up for the new health and fitness features.  Unfortunately, the Pixel Watch 3 starts at $399, a significant increase from the Pixel Watch 2's starting price of $349.I'm interested in the new Pixel Buds, but the limitations of Gemini Live on older devices and the potential need for a subscription are disappointing. On the other hand, I'm waiting for reviews on NC improvement and sound quality. I highly appreciate the improvement in battery life.Overall, it feels like Google is prioritizing flashy AI features over addressing fundamental user pain points. This are my personal thoughts but I would like to hear yours, what watch would you purchase.Btw I own pixes 6 pro, watch 2, Galaxy buds 2 pro, at the moment I consider upgrading my buds, with the phone I believe I'll wait to see what google does next year... ","244":"Hello everyone,The primary goal of sharing this experience is not to receive feedback, but to share my story in the hope that it could lead to improvements in the quality of service.I\u2019m a 29-year-old developer. I\u2019ve been passionate about developing apps and contributing to the Google Play Store for 4 years. Unfortunately, I faced the termination of my Google Play Developer account for being wrongly associated with another person, and I\u2019d like to share my story.In May 2022, I received an email from Google stating that my Google Play Developer account had been terminated. This account was incredibly important to me as it was the platform where I shared my work and connected with a global audience. The termination came as a complete shock because the email mentioned strong indications that my account was related to or sharing information with other developer accounts already terminated.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/rcti9o30nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf5719c5565528ed86afb74754e224ad2db0e370After a long period of confusion trying to understand the problem, which wasn't clear enough for me, I had only two options: clicking on a \"yes\" button that I didn't respect Google rules and giving explanations, or clicking on \"no\" with no possibility to add any commentary or text. It was illogical for someone not understanding the situation and facing \"strong indications\" to simply click \"no.\" I decided to start the appeal process, where I explained my shock, confusion, and misunderstanding of the situation under the \"yes\" button because I expected a high quality of support, as the support team claimed to be understanding to the maximum possible extent.A few hours later, I received an email from Google confirming that they reviewed my case and upheld their shocking and unexpected decision to terminate my account.Later that day, I remembered a recent discussion I had on WhatsApp with a developer I had recently met. I had given him my WhatsApp number to communicate with me. This was strange and incomprehensible if it was the reason for the termination, and if the developer accounts mentioned in the email were referencing this one individual person, whose development history I did not know.In a state of shock and confusion, I mentioned meeting this person and providing him with my phone number, explaining the reason why I did that. A few hours later, I received confirmation from Google that my account was still terminated. These automated responses left me lost, with no one to discuss the situation with.I wondered if any similar reasons could be behind the termination, and I mentioned similar cases of people I had recently contacted.I sent multiple appeals, each time explaining that I didn\u2019t understand the situation and that it was really hurtful to lose my personal account unexpectedly and without tolerance. I clicked on the \"yes\" button because it suggested that clicking it could lead to tolerance.There was no response and no consideration from Google, which was really demoralizing.A few months later, I discovered Reddit posts mentioning the exact email I received, explaining that the reason for termination was that Google was accusing me of either creating my account or someone helping me manage my account. I was really mad and disappointed\u2014not only because these were false accusations, but also because **I found a better explanation of the problem from an unknown person on the internet rather than from the support team**, which was supposed to help me and provide guidance, especially since I had mentioned my misunderstanding of the situation.So I recontacted the support team, explaining that I found the explanation of their email outside of Google links on a Reddit post. I pointed out that their email wasn\u2019t precise enough and that their explanatory links were misleading, only referring to errors within my applications, and that I had a reason to be a victim of misunderstanding.No answer from Google.I kept appealing for months, explaining my misunderstanding and referring to the developer person I had met, clarifying that our meeting was casual and that I gave him my phone number for a reason I explained. I provided as much detail and evidence of my innocence as possible, including proof of solo working, reasons why I had a personal developer account, and a history of good faith developing. I also explained that I clicked on \"yes\" out of confusion and because I wanted better understanding from the support team.Among the evidence of solo working I provided were:1. All of the graphics are in my search history.2. I was developing and testing every update using my personal phone, and sometimes my brother's.3. I used my personal computer for development and research.4. The source codes were my own style.5. All of the activity on my account was confirmed while I was at home.6. I was a previous developer of a dynamic website. I created my personal developer account exactly at the end of hosting my site, focusing on Android development instead of web development.7. I was publishing my applications on different stores under my full name.8. I provided proof that I was responsible for translating my applications.9. I shared a link I used for organizing my work daily.10. I provided evidence of solo efforts in completing some education applications.11. I explained the existence of some applications on my phone to complete some testing, like the Amazon App Store and Samsung App Store.12. I used Firebase and Admob, which should prove the analysis of solo work.13. I managed my social media account solely.14. I explained the research I did every time I had to use new software, like when I started using Unity 3D for making games.15. I showed that my applications improved in quality over time due to personal efforts and knowledge.16. I pointed out the absence of friendship with that person on different social media accounts.17. I explained that the other person was interested in his own business and not in mine.18. I clarified that each person was in a different city for years and that we were always far from each other.I discussed many hypotheses, trying to explain that Google's decision was a mistake.I kept repeating and explaining that the meeting was casual, but Google never considered my explanations, until one day: **February 2, 2023**, when I explained technically what had already been said. I explained the 10-minute difference: when the other person saved my phone number on his phone, I wasn\u2019t connected at home, and it took me 10 minutes to come back home from the place of our first meeting, where I then logged in directly and responded to the WhatsApp discussion.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/32utquz3nsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27acd4e481abe3bf13ce717bcdc7b5c0badb871aAnd then, Google reopened a new ticket for me, confirming the decision was based on the phone number on WhatsApp. However, after 5 days, they reaffirmed their decision to terminate my account, still citing strong indications. Not only this, but I was the reason why Google made \"Updates to Google Play Terms of Service\" and sent an email to millions of users on February 8, 2023, mentioning \"Increased clarity and certainty\" and \"Improved readability.\"their response for me was:\"After carefully reviewing your appeal, we're unable to reinstate your Google Play Developer account.**We can confirm that we have found strong indications that your Developer Account is sharing information with, or is related to, other Developer accounts that have been terminated from Google Play for violating Google\u2019s policies.** As we previously explained, in order to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems and putting our users at risk in the process, we can\u2019t share the reasons we\u2019ve concluded that one account is related to another.\"I was so frustrated, feeling wronged, alone, and immorally treated. I had confirmation that I was wronged and that Google had misjudged me, but they didn\u2019t acknowledge their mistake and did not consider giving me back my account.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bhu16mf7nsad1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=de03ae75bb794662b4fdf32719faa309fe3b5bbcI kept appealing and appealing for months without giving up until **May 3, 2023**, when Google reopened my ticket and made the first deep analysis of my situation. This took a month, much longer than the first analysis made on February 8, 2023. This not only proved that I was mistreated and not considered for a long period, but also showed that Google pretended to have clearly checked my case and to have evidence that did not exist or had just vanished.Unfortunately, after the deep analysis, Google confirmed their decision again. This time they reopened a special ticket for me on **June 7, 2023**, where I felt I had priority over other tickets and could appeal four times per day, but I still didn\u2019t understand why my ticket wasn\u2019t resolved.At this period, I think **my case and feedback were taken seriously to improve service quality at Google Play**. I kept asking them to verify my identity when I provided my ID card, and asked them to consider my case to prevent me from making another account if I didn\u2019t respect the rules. They didn\u2019t accept my appeal, but they started asking for identity verification from everyone else. They also started asking for more information to help them decide whether to terminate an account for being related or not, such as if you were a previous developer for a website, it is unlikely that your current developer account would be associated with someone else if they registered your phone number.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wir70xmcnsad1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd94986449b6e06643bd3d1c2627304885bb8743So I kept appealing and appealing again and again, but there was no resolution even though I was telling the truth.I also explained that my misunderstanding was based on the imprecision of their email, and that I thought my applications were reported by users for being accused of spying and sharing information, which could have been caused by my accidental copying and pasting of source code that allowed this. I just wanted to discuss the situation because at the time my account was terminated, I received some false accusations from users that my applications were spying on them, which I totally deny.Now i only receive the copy past message:\"As explained in our previous emails, I am not able to provide any more details or a better answer to your question. I made sure to include all the information available to me.\"but they never asked me any question or to provide any document or information.During years of solo developing, of course, I had a few minor personal mistakes, but all my work was solo and not related to any other person.To this day, my personal account is still terminated. I can\u2019t monetize my applications on other stores using Admob, and my AdSense account was also terminated due to a false accusation not based on any evidence. This prevents me from monetizing my YouTube channel too.Thank you for reading.","245":"[Best browser](https:\/\/www.google.com\/), the behemoth technology company that has become a verb for online search, is offering financial aid to students who take their certificate programs in data analysis, project management and user experience.Calling it \u201ca digital jobs program to help America\u2019s economic recovery,\u201d the offering comes during record-high joblessness in the U.S. because of quarantines and shutdowns implemented to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u00a0 In addition to workplaces, many college and university campuses shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:**Hardware:** Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring \u201cthump\u201d rather than a plasticy \u201cslap\u201d.  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.  **Keyboard:** I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I\u2019d enjoy \u201chome\u201d and \u201cend\u201d buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google\u2019s 2 year cloud storage service) **Screen:** The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.**Camera:** The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven\u2019t tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s fine.**Speakers:** can get very loud and sound good on hard surfaces**Ports:** the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven\u2019t tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.**Computation:** ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can\u2019t help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I\u2019ve managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.**Chrome OS:** The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I\u2019ve seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn\u2019t much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren\u2019t yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn\u2019t yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google\u2019s update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.**Apps:** I haven\u2019t played with these too much but I\u2019ve found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn\u2019t supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven\u2019t turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won\u2019t work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I\u2019ll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.  **Extras:** 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn\u2019t have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I\u2019m pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn\u2019t a \u201cfull computer\u201d, the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I\u2019m happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I\u2019m happy to be in \u201cwork\u201d mode on my Chromebook.  When it\u2019s time to play, I\u2019ll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.  Less is more; Chrome OS is my 5th screen.  ","247":"Sorry in advance for the long post, but Google has seriously upset me with this one...So, lets recap. On Thursday, some jerk accessed my account fraudulently. Google did not notify me. S\/he went on to access my Google account and spent over $500 on online poker. Google did not notify me. I caught it via an e-mail from Paypal (one of my outside funding sources). I won't go into the fact they purchased over $500 in online poker tokens when in the past year I literally have only bought digital media (books, movies, and music), not games through Google. One would think that would raise a red flag in the old fraud industry, not to mention gifting it to a suspicious sounding email addressed (literally couldn't make that up if I tried)... I contacted Google and they immediately identified that the account was compromised and refunded all transactions. I will say, the individuals I worked with on Thursday were well trained and very Customer Service driven. I, the Customer, then went through and removed all outside payment sources. I, the Customer, then went and cancelled all my credit and debit cards for good measure, and placed a fraud flag on my credit report --  just to be on the safe side since they had access to my gmail, which contained user id's for multiple accounts. Thus far, only Google was breached, thankfully. I also have added two-step verification for all accounts, not just Google. Google did not do any of this or recommend it to me, however I can't be to upset about this as that's all account configurations that Customers have an obligation to monitor, so I understand. On Monday (4 days later) I find that a legitimate purchase that I requested not to be cancelled (even though it was made weeks prior to the incident) was in fact cancelled (I was told there was a 50\/50 chance it would happen, so I wasn't terribly surprised -- I guess their auto refund system isn't very robust). So, using the $10.35 I had in credit on my account (remember my outside sources have been removed, this is literally just Google Credit), I proceeded to try and purchase the $3.96 album that was incorrectly removed. This failed. So, I contact Google, who then transfers me to Wallet Support. Wallet Support says they believe there has been fraudulent activity on my account (4 days later) and will be deactivating my account temporarily (I wont even begin going over how horrible their timing is...). I, the Customer who called in, instead of being able to listen to the album I had ALREADY purchased then had the extremely fun experience of sending my drivers license and copy of a bank statement to some random individual with whom I was not aloud to speak to. We'll just ignore the fact that my account was used just days before and I've taken steps to ensure no other personal information wasn't accessed. This took several hours (even though I submitted my information immediately) and Google's wonderful reply after complying with their request for my personal information? \"Unfortunately, in an effort to protect our users, your Google Payments account will remain closed due to potential unusual or suspicious activity.\" Wallet Support claimed I violated the ToS but can't tell me which one. Can you honestly tell me this is doing the best for the Customer? This came after the hack and after the restore. Had this taken place the day of, that'd be one thing, but literally 4 days later rebuying an already bought purchase weeks prior to being hacked? Something isn't adding up here.I've been an Android user for years (T-Mobile G1 bought new) and long time Google user. I've been using Wallet almost since it's release. Over the years, I switched to using ONLY Google for my digital purchases, and this is how I'm treated. A generic response to having my account closed, with no explanation, no Customer Support, and absolutely no focus on doing what's right? I find it sad I can no longer use an account to make purchases for some arbitrary reason.This whole mess screams of Google needing to take a hard look at their practices. At best, this gives them the opportunity to review the situation from the top down. At worst, it has me now having the make the choice of where to next? I'm currently using the Nexus 6 and have been in the process of shopping for a new phone (was strongly considering the OnePlus 3), but since I lost my digital account via Google, I honestly may have to look elsewhere (Apple...). I have thought about creating a new Google account and just having both, but that's troublesome when the whole point of these accounts is to make things easier.Sorry for the rant, but their response and timing has been atrocious to say the least.TLDR: Google suspended my wallet account 4 days after being hacked and having my account restored, thus never letting me use a paid Google service again.#**Update:**Well, I have to give credit where credit is due but also call out some missed opportunities. After comparing my options, which were to switch to Apple, Windows, or create a new Google account, I ultimately decided on sticking with Google (not the least to do with having strongly been considering going to Project Fi). Last night I decided to call Google Wallet support one last time to see if they would unsuspend my account before making a new one and moving on. I was fortunate enough to speak to one of the most pleasant Customer Service reps I've ever spoken to. Not only was she extremely helpful, she actually took the time to listen to my issue and was empathetic. It took her some time, but she was able to work with her background team to unsuspend my account! She did mention that it would take 4 hours or so for successful purchases, which was no problem as it was late anyway and I was just happy to have an unlocked account. Fast forward to this afternoon when I tried to buy a new album. It failed, so I called Google (by this point I had an email from their Support apologizing for the mishap and that my account was fully unlocked). This time I was unfortunate and had a service rep who only read her script and said my account needed further review and was now suspended again. After being on hold for nearly 10 minutes she said that her team had to investigate further and would call me back. I immediately hung up and called back. I got yet another rep who couldn't understand why the previous one had suspended me (or rather her investigative team, as she called it) and had my account unlocked within 20 minutes and again advised that it would take 4 hours for me to make purchases. No problem!I can now make purchases and have a fully unlocked account! It's sad that the support was so hit or miss, but the two agents that truly helped really have impressed me and restored my faith in Google. Hopefully this thread\/rant\/run-on helps someone in a similar situation.","248":"As we know, Google offers Pixel 2 owner unlimited space on google photo with original quality. Here is what it says on Google Store (at the bottom of Pixel 2 Phone page)> \u00b9Unlimited original-quality storage for photos and videos taken with Pixel until 15 January 2021, and unlimited high-quality storage for photos taken with Pixel afterwards. Requires Google Account and Internet connection.\u200b Data rates may apply\u200b. However, I noticed my Google photo still claims I used 13G space even all the photos and videos were taken by my Pixel2 uploaded by Google Photo App on the phone. I can clear see the follow words in the Google Photo settings on my phone.>Photos & videos uploaded from your Pixel before 2021-01-16 get unlimited free storage at original quality.I am confused, so I called Google support and expect a professional explanation. However, I am even more disappointed after the conversation with a Google support. I was told in order not to use any space in Google Photo, I have to disable HDR+ in the Camera app (it is also a stock Google app), which is enabled by default. The support said HDR+ produces photo and video with high definition quality, which is not original quality anymore, then those photos and videos will be using space in Google Photo. Am I misunderstand anything here? First of all, we know HDR stand for \"High Dynamic Range\", rather than \"High Definition Resolution\" (The term Google support tries to confuse me). With HDR, we can get better quality of picture by merging multiple images during shooting. It won't make photo or video much bigger. Google Photo has two options of the quality when you upload a photo or video, \"Original Quality\" and \"High Quality\". Here is my understanding of these two options. \\- With \"Original Quality\", Google will not do any about  your photo and video, and keep it the same as that produced by your camera, no matter what settings your camera are. Because \"Original Quality\" can potentially be very big, so, Google won't offer unlimited space for regular user. But as a benefit of Pixel2 owner in order to promote its phone.  \\- With \"High Quality\", Google will convert your photo and video into a standard definition defined by Google, which will limit the size of the photo and video. With that control, Google can provide unlimited space for everyone. For some reason, my photos and videos took by Pixel 2 phone still used a lot of space on Google Photo. Google support is  not trying to fix the problem for me, but fooling me around with some wrong terms and cut off the conversion when I pointed her mistake. &#x200B;","249":"I don't mean for this to be a post bashing Google, but I would like to point out a pattern in the compare products that has bothered me for some time and I think should be a higher priority for improvement.Many of Google's products (software mostly of course) seem to be made for unilingual users in a multilingual world. Google's primary market (Americans) fits quite well with this category.However, many multilingual Americans and most people from other countries in Europe and across the world use at least their native language and English interchangeably on the web, if not more than those two. (Personally I am raised bilingually and use English as a third language on a daily basis, just as an example.)Now, how does Google target unilingual users:* Maps reviews are automatically translated into your phone's language or else in English. This causes situations where a review in one of my native languages (but not my phone's) is translated into English, while there was no need to. I can read it, but a translated version will never be as accurate as the original one.* For some reason, YouTube's video titles are occasionally translated from English into my phone's language. This is SUPER weird and completely unnecessary. If I'm browsing all-English videos I really don't need the occasional Dutch title, especially if the video isn't in Dutch anyway. (IIRC auto-subtitles are in English only?)* Search results by default prefer results in my home language and country of origin, while these may by far not be the most useful results. Case in point: Google consistently pushes the Wikipedia in my native language to the top, with the English Wikipedia somewhere further down. We all know the English wiki is really good, but the other ones not really (at least often not as good). It is totally unnecessary and paternalistic to shove the Dutch wiki up my plate.* Likewise, with Google News it is not always easy to choose the language or country of origin of the news you want to find. Google does it for you, ignoring the possibility that one may live in two different countries, speak different languages, move around alot. Many of the above issues will be experienced my people with a multilingual background and\/or a mobile lifestyle. I feel this is perhaps more of a thing in the EU than in the USA. In any case, it hurts the experience of using Google's otherwise quality software. There are some easy solutions to this, by simply allowing users to toggle translations and\/or locations while browsing, or setting a number of native languages and locations in your profile that the big G remembers across platforms.Anyone else have a similar experience?","250":"All I wanted was to give them three cents.

My name is Logan. me10:41 PMWhat it is, dudebro?Logan A10:41 PMWell mr Dudebro, it is a fine wednesday. me10:41 PMhahLogan A10:41 PMAnd what it is with you on this fine evening?me10:42 PMNot a whole lot. Just got off work actually.Logan A10:42 PMNice, i'll be there soon enough myself.\u00a0How can I help you sir?me10:43 PMGood to hear it.So, I need 3 cents to buy a track on your music storeI'd like to do so, but I'm not super excited about adding another five bucks into my play wallet thingymajigger.Can I do a custom amount on my credit card, or split the payment or what?Logan A10:43 PMI see. Unfortunately we don't have the capabilities of doing split payments on any purchases at this time. I wish I had that magic yes to give you man. me10:44 PMYeah, we dont either. We can do custom charg-up though.*charge, even.Hrm. Can you spot me three cents?Logan A10:45 PMI absolutely would spot you if it were in my power, but I don't have that capability. me10:46 PMAlrighty. Can you cut me a check for the 1.34 I've got on there?Logan A10:47 PMUnfortunately I cannot do that either. Once it's on there, it's on there for digital content only. me10:47 PMThat's actually a legal requirement in many states. Not mine, so you're off the hook, but you'll want to look into that.Logan A10:47 PMGood to know!me10:47 PMSo! How do I make use of those funds without adding extra cash onto the account?Logan A10:48 PMHmm, without adding funds, you could search for a free app that offers in-app purchasesme10:48 PMor rather, without adding extra dangling leftover cash.Logan A10:49 PMOr possibly peruse the Play Books department of the Play Store. Copy that. I think the only legit answer I can give for that would be to find a few different purchases that may add up to the balance, but I don't really have an exact workaround for that at this time. I'm sorry man, I want to give you that golden fix, but I don't have it. me10:49 PMThat's super no bueno. Having no options at all for a user to empty their account out is super sadtimes. I imagine that's something you see feedback escalated to the bigwigs about pretty regularly?Logan A10:50 PMHonestly not too often, a lot of the purchases usually round off to an even balance. But sometimes the tax kicks in and bumps the amount to random amounts. me10:50 PMThat would be totally fine too. Tax wrecks those plans though. :saye1.37.Logan A10:50 PMExactly!me10:51 PMYou guys use an in-house chat solution, or do you have a vendor?Logan A10:51 PMI feel you on this one OP, honestly. Whether or not you are chatting, emailing, or calling us directly you're speaking with Google.\u00a0We all do a bit of everything here. me10:52 PMoh yeah, I mean the program you use.

Just curious.In the US?Logan A10:56 PMLikewise, fair enough to ask!Oh yes. I can tell you that. me10:56 PMGood enough.Can I chat with your bossman?Logan A10:56 PMI could do that for you. Do you mind if I ask what it is regarding? me10:57 PMI'm betting if I go far enough up the chain someone can give me three pennies. I'm curious how far I need to go before I get shut out, or someone gives me three pennies.Logan A10:57 PMOk, I can get my supervisor for you sir however I cannot promise any pennies. But I will see what we can do!Do you mind waiting for just a moment?me10:58 PMTotally fine. thanks!Logan A11:02 PMThanks!So I'm going to transfer you into a chat with my Supervisor. Her name is Arien. me11:02 PMthanks!Logan A11:04 PMThank you for waiting!It shouldn't be too much longer now.

As long as you've got the general idea.Arien M11:07 PMI see that you're three pennies short, is that correct>?me11:08 PMI'd like to have exactly three cents added to my google play account, yes. I can give you three cents, you can put three cents on there, I could mail you an envelope with three pennies in it if you like.I just want to zero it out.Arien M11:08 PMIf I could that, I would be more than happy to, however, I don't have a way to add three cents to an account. me11:08 PMReally?Arien M11:09 PMReally!me11:09 PMThat strikes me as intensely poor design. Do you guys have a tools team, or are you using all vendor service software?Arien M11:10 PMWell we have a 'tools' team, however they don't do anything in regards to adding funds to customer accounts. me11:10 PMno no, but it should certainly be an option. Perhaps your finance guys vetoed it, ours usually arent thrilled about it.Can you perform zero costs for licenses?Arien M11:11 PMI would have to say no, since I'm not sure what you're referring to in regards to 'zero cost for licenses'.me11:12 PMFree product. Songs in this instance, I'm honestly not entirely sure what other things you offer.If you could grant me the song I'm looking for for free, and then zero the balance in my play wallet thing, I'd be fine with that.Arien M11:12 PMI'm unable to do that. me11:13 PMYikes, they really dont give you guys a lot of options. So... what COULD you do?in any way at all, to allow me to spend my mighty dollar and thirtyfour cents, without having to add a whole five bucks to my play wallet dealy?Arien M11:14 PMGive me a moment. me11:14 PMtake your timeArien M11:16 PMIf you would like you can download the Google Opinion Rewards Android App from the Play Store.On here you can take surveys and are rewarded with Play Credit.me11:16 PMI've heard about that doodad. I dont have an android phone though.and I imagine it would likely reward me with more than three cents in credit, which is the number I'm interested in.Precisely three.Arien M11:17 PMWell you are correct about that, you would get a dollar.me11:17 PMThat is a lovely function, and I'm sure it is an excellent option for people who are in a position to make use of it.Arien M11:18 PMUnfortunately there is not a way for me to provide you with exactly 3 cents. If I had a way to, please trust that I would.me11:20 PMI imagine so, support contacts lasting as long as this one cost a great deal more than three cents, it would be the very pinnacle of cents to give me my three pennies to make me go away... or sense, rather. I wish I could say that had been intentional, lolHow many people do you manage, if you dont mind my asking?Arien M11:21 PMLOL. That's irrelevant, and as I stated there is no way for me to provide you with three cents. me11:21 PMNot to the case at hand, of course, I was just trying to determine what level of responsibility and access you likely have. I presume you have a superior?Arien M11:22 PMDon't we all...however, I'm the highest level of support customers have access to.me11:23 PMTruly? I find that generally if you push hard enough you can get 3-4 levels up before the really-truly bossman spawns.Arien M11:23 PMI'm the end of the line, and have no way to get you a free song or three cents. me11:24 PMI mean, if your frontline folks had access to anything at all that could actually... like... do anything, then perhaps. As far as I can tell they do not, and neither do you. I presume that someone in your organization does have some support tools?Arien M11:25 PMAs I stated before we have no way to do this. Is there anything else I can help you with. me11:26 PMThat was the only thing I had in mind. I would really truly like to speak with your supervisor though.And be provided a feedback form that I might discuss the level of access that you guys have with your.. I dunno, project managers or what have youArien M11:28 PMIf that was an option I would be more than happy to get you to them, however I'm it. You did skip level coming straight to me if that helps. You're more than welcome to provide feedback through the survey at the end of this chat. me11:28 PMThat's all the more baffling really. I presume at that level you manage some hundred or so people, and that you would have almost no ability to interact with a customer account is incredibly confusing.I mean, what functions do you have to \"sweeten the deal\" as it were? Is that just not something your organization does?Arien M11:31 PMAgain there just isn't a tool to do what you're asking. As mentioned, there is no way to add three cents to a customers account.

I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","252":"Hi, So I just sold my iPhone 16 Pro Max and got a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Since I'm new to Pixel (got a long history with OnePlus though) I have a few questions:1. Why can't I geht rid of the \"at a glance\" widget? I'm not a fan of third party launchers, so please tell me I can customize it somehow. 2. Why can't I put any shortcut or widget in the red area? All that space ist lost as well just because of the \"at a glance\" widget? I refuse to believe that. 3. On my OnePlus (Google Assistant) and on the iPhone (Siri) it wasn't a problem to set an alarm using a voice command. However Gemini tells me it can't so anything that involves clocks. I'm using it in my mother tongue German. But please tell me this is joke\/there is some other way. Please help me out guys.Thanks. ","253":"2 things in particular - I used to be able to set timers, change the song on Spotify, etc with Gemini like Google Assistant used to do. About a week ago, it started saying things like \"Sorry, I can't help with that. You can set or adjust the alarm on most devices by using their built-in clock apps.By the way, there are some extensions that require Gemini App Activity to work. You can turn this on at Gemini App Activity.\" Gemini App Activity has been turned off since I got 3he phone months ago so that setting hasn't changed at all.  Anyone know how to get these features working again with Gemini?Second thing is this weird response I got yesterday. (Screenshot)Without being promoted, it started listening while I was talking to my roommate and picked up what looks like gibberish then gave me weird responses including informing me that Gemini is, in fact, not a minor. Based on what it picked up, I don't know how it'd be led to thing I was asking for something inappropriate relating to minors. Gemini seems to have gotten dumber and more useless since I got the Pixel 9 XL Pro Ultra Omega whatever that call this shit now. Anyone else experiencing the same thing? ","254":"I wanted to detail my experience of using a Pixel 7a for close to 11 months. I bought one to be my daily driver, because where I live, the flagship was way too expensive and I wasn't sure how good or bad the experience would be. Initially, things were perfect. Loved the adaptive charging, UX, camera features. I even recommended my sister to get a Pixel 8.After about 3 months I started getting call drop issues. I found out it's a common one and occassionaly did restarts to counter the problem. My sister meanwhile was disillusioned with the camera (particularly colour rendering- she's a dentist and uses it to take snaps of teeth for aligning colour and send to labs) and she switched out for an S24 within 2 months. About 6-7 months later I started noticing flaws and bugs in the updates, found that night photography was not too good, and started getting a bug where the call button stopped responding. I had to restart the phone to reset this. There were some battery drain issues so I used to turn off location, Bluetooth etc to counter them. I liked it that updates were prompt and adhered to my company's policies. Finally, last Friday, I had an issue with my laptop and had to use my phone all day. For about 6 hours I couldn't make a single call and had to whatsApp people to call me. I was on a parallel work call on an app so I couldn't restart the device like I usually did. The mobile network kept cutting off once or twice as well, randomly. There were app issues where I couldn't make calls or mute myself, but that's on Microsoft, not a Pixel issue I hope.So on Friday night I finally broke down and placed the order.I had so much hope and really loved the UX. Unfortunately it was an experience which I would  never want to put myself in. If a phone doesn't do the basics of what a phone should, it just shouldn't exist. Just make a laptop or a tablet instead. I'm sure I won't buy a Pixel again, it was just so disappointing after all the hope and hype.","255":"I purchased my Google Pixel 8 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB) last October. Yesterday, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Black, 512 GB). It's been 24 hours with the new device, so here\u2019s my honest experience:1. UI: The Pixel has a cleaner UI that feels faster but tends to stutter. Apps like Reddit, Twitter, and even some websites on Chrome lag while scrolling. The Pixel has good animations and responsive haptics. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's One UI is super smooth and feels more like a premium device. Scrolling is noticeably better\u2014on the Pixel 8 Pro, one swipe gets me about 11 posts down, while on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the same swipe moves through 20 posts. The Pixel UI feels tight, while One UI slides more fluidly. I used to think the Pixel UI was fast, but now I know what fast really is. It's like people saying 60Hz is fine until they experience 120Hz.2. Performance:  I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because of overheating issues with the Pixel 8 Pro. For example, one day, while trying to book a cab using multiple apps with mobile data and location on, the Pixel 8 Pro got extremely warm within 5 minutes. It became uncomfortable to hold, and when I took it out of my pocket, one of the cab apps had crashed, and the battery had drained by 10% in just 15-20 minutes. As a longtime Nexus and Pixel user, this was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how this phone is supposed to handle 7 years of software updates. After getting the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I transferred my data using Smart Switch, and it only got mildly warm during the setup. Once it was set up, the phone frame felt cool to the touch. Even after watching a YouTube video in 4K for 40 minutes, it didn\u2019t get warm at all. The device is snappy and feels like you\u2019re typing on a slab of glass, unlike the Pixel's velvety feeling. Also, the Pixel gets quite warm when charging with a 20W PD charger, which is not ideal.3. Battery: Battery life was another major reason for switching to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Pixel's battery tends to die on long workdays. Even with adaptive charging, by 7 PM, it\u2019s often down to 18% after moderate use. The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is inconsistent\u2014some weeks, it lasts all day, and other times, it struggles to make it through. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with Google\u2019s updates, but the battery performance seems to fluctuate.On the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I charged it to 100% yesterday at 7 PM, and now, 23 hours later, it's still at 40%. I\u2019m confident it can easily last a whole day with heavy use. The battery management is impressive.4. Extras: I do miss the \"Best Take\" feature on the Pixel and the ability to take screenshots and copy text from the recent menu. However, Samsung\u2019s feature granularity is impressive. The S-Pen is decent; I expected it to be as good as the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s not quite there. Still, I enjoy the functionality of the stylus and the sound it makes when writing notes, like writing on coarse paper.5. Camera: The camera isn't my primary concern, which might be why I was able to switch away from the Pixel more easily. The Pixel\u2019s camera is excellent, producing very natural-looking photos. The Samsung camera is good for most situations but doesn\u2019t quite match the Pixel's photo processing quality. In conclusion, the Pixel\u2019s UI is better and feels very user-friendly, but the Tensor G3 chip seems to hold it back. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers a superior experience, but you wouldn\u2019t realize this unless you use both phones for a while. For me, the ideal phone would have the UI and camera of the Pixel and the hardware of the Samsung. But that's a dream for another day.","256":"I have been testing Gemini on my pixel, and it sucks hard.1- it forces you to opt in for human reviews to use it2- the simplest of asks like \"play a song on YouTube music\" require an extension. YOU OWN THE 2 SERVICES GOOGLE. 3- most of the commands on assistant just doesn't work. \"Play a YouTube video\"? No extension. \"Skip 10 seconds\"? Sorry can't do. \"Play my recommendations\"? Here are videos titled \"my recommendations\" 4- anything that does work, just uses assistant anyway. What is even the point of having Gemini instead of assistant. 5- your phone is locked? Tough luck, gotta unlock to do anything Gemini is a good alternative for GPT to make a list or re work an email, but it doesn't function as a replacement for assistant at all and is not worth having people listen in to you 24\/7","257":"Fellow brethren, This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel, without sacrificing any features in the previous guides I've seen here.(Switching back to 60hz, uninstalling social media apps etc).So I've had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now. The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT, which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in (6hrs). Now as the days passed, I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery. I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta, so I switched over. Now the SOT became 6.5hrs. Not good enough. Then I took the steps below, and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly. It's also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc. I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi. Also bear in mind that I'm on A15 beta. The phone is flawless for me.1. Use a really good battery monitor. Pixel inline battery monitor is okay, but it's not great. BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors. But sadly it doesn't work on android 15 :( . So I used two: Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor. Both are really good. But Gsam has more data recording and visualization (graphs for heat, battery, CPU usage and a lot more). Also accubattery doesn't record how much battery the phone signal, WiFi, CPU, android system, Kernel etc use. While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone. You can get the premium versions from Mobilism (listed in the wiki of r\/piracy) which I think gives you some extra features. You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb.2. Install macrodroid and get the \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro from the macro repository inside the app. If you understand, feel free to move on to the next one, but  If you find the above sentence dense, here's a breakdown:Macrodroid is an app which executes macros(scripts) that you install on the phone. For example, you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone, or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etc.Now, there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itself(in the bottom panel and then search for it), and the one that you want to install is called \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro. This enables battery saver when the phone is locked. Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker. Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone! You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable android.permissions.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS via adb. (Don't worry, it'll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out.) Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally.3. Using savetuner. This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications. You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app. I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit (screenshot attached) to get real time updates from apps, but also put them into deep sleep otherwise. Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when it's locked! The phone also doesn't kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu! 4. Use 4G. I know this might be a deal breaker for some people, but for me it works great. I get the speeds I want from it, the phone doesn't heat up and stays cool. I also haven't had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc. Also, my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times, connected with my watch.5. (Optional) Using A15 beta. Things are much much smoother. The animations, the performance of the phone etc. If you do update, clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it. This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats. For some reason, this helps the battery life. I also have now playing, Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on.6. Debloat your Pixel phone. Yes, you heard me right. Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat, but it isn't. There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the background.There is an amazing FOSS app called 'Canta' which helps your debloat your phone. It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat. They have been tested such that, if you remove it nothing breaks. It has a description of what the app does if you click on it, so you can decide if you want to remove it. I've attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you don't lose any features. If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want, don't worry. You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app! (I don't use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc, so you don't find them in the save list. You can decide for yourself with the descriptions)7. Use the 20 - 80 rule. I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life. I use battery to check the current battery health (even though I doubt the accuracy). My last phone (Realme), I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule.8. Using Icebox and disabling background usage. Icebox is an app which disables any app that you select, when you lock your phone. My biggest standby drainers were Instagram,Snapchat and Mull ( a hardened version of Firefox). Mull has been fixed now so I've added Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox. Now this will freeze the app (like you disabled it), so you won't be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone. No worries, you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen! I've also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp, but this will result in you losing access to microphone if you minimize WhatsApp when during a call.9. Things I wish could improve: Video calling. I do a lot of WhatsApp video calls and this eats battery like crazy. I wish Google would improve the optimization of battery on video calls.10. If you reached this far, here's a BONUS tip! If you have rooted your phone, the Sultan Kernel for pixel 8 is an amazing option for battery and performance. I've heard reports of less heat, battery consumption and snappier performance. He's doing what Google Devs should do and for the benefit of the community. So check it out! Thanks for listening! I hope people can benefit from what I did so that you can enjoy your Pixel device. Let me know if you have any questions!","258":"Bought a pixel 9 pro and set up Gemini. Google offered me a subscription free for the first year and then $20\/month after that. I think it gave me an extra TB of space on the cloud or whatever and that was about it. I'll never get close to using that much space, and I'm already having a hard time justifying $20\/month ($240\/year) for that and Gemini. The real problem is, I don't really see how Gemini is any more beneficial or useful than google assistant. I know AI is all the rage these days, and has uses, but I'm not really ever using Gemini on a daily basis and can't really see the benefits of it, especially for $20\/month. I've played around with it some and aside from a few quirky features here and there, it's mostly useless. I'm no AI aficionado or anything by any means, but it seems very limited in what it can and can't do. I've noticed that it can't even do some things that google assistant could through simple voice commands. Can someone help me justify paying $20\/month for this service in the future or give me some tips on how I can use this more in my day to day tasks? Right now I'm just not seeing it, and tbh I'm not sure what will happen in a year when I decide not to pay for Gemini. Will my phone automatically go back to Google assistant or will I just be SOL and lose some of the functionality of my phone by not paying for this service? Am I missing something in terms of what all I'd be getting out my phone and Gemini for $20\/month? Seems like a waste of money unless I'm going to be forced to be stuck with it or nothing after my free trial ends. ","259":"I\u2019m daily driving an iPhone SE 3 and while it\u2019s reliable and a serious powerhouse, the outdated design and limited functionality of iOS bore me. I miss torrenting, emulation,  split-screen multitasking, zooming and having access to huge OLEDs without needing to sell a kidney. Surprisingly, a refurbishing company offered me \u20ac300 for my SE.A reseller in my area has multiple boxed Pixel 6 Pro models in stock for \u20ac280. These appear to be sealed units, refurbished by Google themselves. At this price point, only POCO or Redmi devices offer bang for buck in The Netherlands.But the thing is that I\u2019ve always used flagships. All the current Chinese mid-rangers around the \u20ac300 price point I\u2019ve tried have been disappointing to me. The cost-cutting is evident in all of these devices. The shitty macro cameras, poor video recording performance, bloatware, trash UI skins and cheap build quality all left a bad taste in my mouth.The Pixel 6 Pro, while old, still is a proper flagship with a high-end camera system. The problem is that it\u2019s apparently being cut off from updates this year and I\u2019ve heard TONS of horror stories relating to the modem and battery. My SE lasts 5-6 hours on a single charge. If the Pixel has similar battery life that would be disappointing.Is someone daily driving the Pixel 6 Pro or would someone like to revisit this device for me and help me to make a decision? Thanks!","260":"I'm not sure that I love it.  I want to love it, but there's just so many tiny things that have been irking me to the point of possibly returning it under buyers remorse.  Hoping some may shed some light on my issues and if there's hope of them being resolved. For context I was using a IPhone 11 last, but has generally been an android user. 1. The absolutely horrid GPS tracking\/accuracy.  I use Quickbooks to track my mileage for work, and doing the same drives everyday I'm noticing wildly different and inconsistent reporting. I tried turning my location on and off as well as resetting the phone. And it seemed to improve a bit, but still some weird inconsistencies as compared to previous phone.  And even while just using Google maps I've seen it get caught up and show an inaccurate location, one of which caused me to take a wrong turn.2. Bluetooth - on 3 different devices it has cut out randomly on me, my car, my ear buds, and my Bluetooth speaker. I've tried restarting phone as well as forgetting all devices and re-pairing them, but that was most recent so haven't really had a chance to test cut outs.3. The Face unlock is absolutely horrid as well. Especially in low light conditions, but even in some instances with decent lighting, I've noticed that I have to hold the phone at an exact angle for it to register, a thing I never new as an issue with iPhone. And then Low light is an absolute write off. Edit; yes I do mostly use fingerprint unlock, but still a valid concern. 4. There's been an annoyingly noticeable amount of times where the screen just turns off while I'm reading something or watching a reel on Instagram. Even with the auto stay on, in decent enough light the screen just goes black.  Feel like this is connected to the previous issue.I'm hoping theres explanations and solutions to these. Cuz on their own it's minor, but accumulated it's just becoming annoying tiny inconveniencing grievances that are causing me to think this is the best of Google? And wanting to possibly exchange the phone for something else.Please tell me it's a case of PICNIC. ","261":"I have seen a lot of bad reviews\/complaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my (mostly) positive experiences. I bought my phone in 2021 and I've had an overall great experience. Pros: -fast and responsive-easily share files-cellular and data connection always great-multiple users worked seamlessly-photos and photo editing are good (my wife's Samsung seems to take better quality videos though) -Bluetooth connection to multiple devices easily -battery life adequate for my needs  Obviously it's not a perfect phone, some cons: -Android 14 update fiasco, couldn't save files, couldn't take photos for about 10 days -Android auto glitches occasionally, calls wouldn't connect to the car audio, but it must have been fixed since it hasn't happened in a few months -I miss the Pixel 5 back pingerprint sensor-when a phone call or notification interrupts playing music on phone (not connected to Bluetooth) it turns down the music volume after the notification  Considering all this, I still enjoyed the past 3 years with my phone. I'm interested in anyone else's Pixel 6 experiences whether positive or negative. ","262":"Hey all!Long time lurker, first time poster! I finally treated myself to a Pixel 8 a month ago to celebrate a personal milestone. Coming from a Huawei Mate 10 Lite, Samsung A32, and Redmi Note 11, this phone is a HUGE upgrade. I'm absolutely blown away by the clean UI, the snappy performance, and those amazing haptics! And the camera? Forget about it, it's in a league of its own. I'm genuinely thrilled with my Pixel 8 and don't regret my decision for a second.However, I've noticed a few things over the past month that I wanted to share and get your thoughts on:1. I experienced a weird color shifts on the display when using adaptive brightness in direct sunlight. It's hard to describe, but the colors just look off. It goes back to normal as soon as I move out of the sun. Is this a known issue or just me?2. I've noticed a slight audio delay (about 0.5-1 second) when closing apps like Facebook or TikTok while a video is playing. The app closes instantly, but the audio continues for a moment before cutting off. Anyone else experiencing this?3. I feel like my battery life has taken a slight hit after the March update. It's not drastic, but it definitely feels like it was better before. I keep NFC, location, and mobile data off, while Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are always on. Any tips on optimizing battery life would be greatly appreciated!4. I'm using the vertical day\/date\/temperature lock screen style, but sometimes the At a Glance widget still shows up on top of it.Despite these minor issues, I'm still absolutely in love with my Pixel 8. It's truly a fantastic phone, and I'm so glad I made the switch.Thanks for reading my (long!) post. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!","263":"-the boxier \"iPhone\" design looks soooooooo good, and actually makes the phone easier to hold. officially going no case for this one it just feels rock solid -vapor chamber definitely does work! drove for an hour today in hot sun, high brightness gps navigation, playing a YouTube video with picture in picture, all while streaming Bluetooth audio to my car (turned off ac in my car too). pixel 8 pro would turn maps to night mode within 7-10 minutes due to overheating, but 9 pro xl kept steady for solid 25 minutes before turning on night mode (these are def extreme conditions). def cooler overall-super res zoom... actually works? haven't tested it for video\/Video Boost yet, but this is the first time where 30x zoom shots were actually usable.-pixel weather app is cool, but as of right now it's not connected to the weather widget, as that just takes me to the old weather page from Google. gonna keep using the widget till that changes since it's easier to just glance at-tensor G4 seems to have decent improvements over G3, as there are def some things that my 8 pro would stumble with that this handles so well. the extra ram def helps too-battery is TBD, as ofc I'll give adaptive battery time to adjust to my usage (today was a rather heavy day, but still had about 6 hours of screen on time with 10% left). btw anyone know how Google gets their \"over 24 hours\" rating? like how are they using their phones to get them to last that long? maybe I'm just on my phone way too much lol-normally leave my phone on high resolution, but this time I'm gonna switch it to full resolution. paid $1,100 for this thing, why not right? if this majorly affects battery, I'll let yall know (doubt it will tho)that's all i got for now, curious to hear what u guys think!","264":"I purchased my Google Pixel 8 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB) last October. Yesterday, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Black, 512 GB). It's been 24 hours with the new device, so here\u2019s my honest experience:1. UI: The Pixel has a cleaner UI that feels faster but tends to stutter. Apps like Reddit, Twitter, and even some websites on Chrome lag while scrolling. The Pixel has good animations and responsive haptics. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's One UI is super smooth and feels more like a premium device. Scrolling is noticeably better\u2014on the Pixel 8 Pro, one swipe gets me about 11 posts down, while on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the same swipe moves through 20 posts. The Pixel UI feels tight, while One UI slides more fluidly. I used to think the Pixel UI was fast, but now I know what fast really is. It's like people saying 60Hz is fine until they experience 120Hz.2. Performance:  I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because of overheating issues with the Pixel 8 Pro. For example, one day, while trying to book a cab using multiple apps with mobile data and location on, the Pixel 8 Pro got extremely warm within 5 minutes. It became uncomfortable to hold, and when I took it out of my pocket, one of the cab apps had crashed, and the battery had drained by 10% in just 15-20 minutes. As a longtime Nexus and Pixel user, this was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how this phone is supposed to handle 7 years of software updates. After getting the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I transferred my data using Smart Switch, and it only got mildly warm during the setup. Once it was set up, the phone frame felt cool to the touch. Even after watching a YouTube video in 4K for 40 minutes, it didn\u2019t get warm at all. The device is snappy and feels like you\u2019re typing on a slab of glass, unlike the Pixel's velvety feeling. Also, the Pixel gets quite warm when charging with a 20W PD charger, which is not ideal.3. Battery: Battery life was another major reason for switching to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Pixel's battery tends to die on long workdays. Even with adaptive charging, by 7 PM, it\u2019s often down to 18% after moderate use. The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is inconsistent\u2014some weeks, it lasts all day, and other times, it struggles to make it through. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with Google\u2019s updates, but the battery performance seems to fluctuate.On the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I charged it to 100% yesterday at 7 PM, and now, 23 hours later, it's still at 40%. I\u2019m confident it can easily last a whole day with heavy use. The battery management is impressive.4. Extras: I do miss the \"Best Take\" feature on the Pixel and the ability to take screenshots and copy text from the recent menu. However, Samsung\u2019s feature granularity is impressive. The S-Pen is decent; I expected it to be as good as the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s not quite there. Still, I enjoy the functionality of the stylus and the sound it makes when writing notes, like writing on coarse paper.5. Camera: The camera isn't my primary concern, which might be why I was able to switch away from the Pixel more easily. The Pixel\u2019s camera is excellent, producing very natural-looking photos. The Samsung camera is good for most situations but doesn\u2019t quite match the Pixel's photo processing quality. In conclusion, the Pixel\u2019s UI is better and feels very user-friendly, but the Tensor G3 chip seems to hold it back. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers a superior experience, but you wouldn\u2019t realize this unless you use both phones for a while. For me, the ideal phone would have the UI and camera of the Pixel and the hardware of the Samsung. But that's a dream for another day.","265":"I had a issues on my pixel 6.. i dnt know how to turn off the camera sound on camera settings. They said change ur region or sim.

The object was so annoying with the camera click sound. Once I take a picture the object was moving. I can't to turned off my camera sound. Please help how to do this kind of issues handling. ","266":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","267":"Anyone have any idea (please)? Possibilities that occur to me:1. Walkie talkie app. I have searched my apps, but the only thing close is Microsoft Teams. Teams seems to lurk in the background. I don't use the walkie talkie Teams app, but I do use Teams so I don't want to uninstall unless I have to.2. Virus. I dunno; could it be a virus?  I have a Bitdefender subscription with one unused device that might work.3. Alert Hack or Malfunction. When there's a natural disaster threatening my location, I receive alerts despite no open apps. Are these unexplained audios the Alert system hacked or malfunctioning?4. Something else? ","268":"Noise cancelling earbuds offer a different listening experience when compared with regular headphones. For one thing, the skull-aching headband is gone, no longer pushing down and clamping tight earcups to sore ears. However, and we hate to add this qualifier, the best noise cancelling earbuds aren\u2019t as easy to point out as you\u2019d imagine.Besides audio quality and hands-free convenience, it all comes down to human anatomy. Earbuds, by their very nature, slide into ear canals. If the fit is bad, expect discomfort and poor ambient sound isolation, and that\u2019s just for starters. Passive noise cancelling, the seal against background noise, is followed up by sound stage attenuation and a weak bass.Even spatial effects suffer, putting a cramp on the acoustic immersion you expect from premium noise cancelling earbuds.The trade-offs are real, but we know just how to sidestep such technology headaches. We\u2019ve got you, dude. To that end, a list of best-in-class ANC earbuds is incoming\u2014including prepackaged ear-comfort tips\u2014 and every one of them will rock your world. First, let\u2019s check out the technological slang that often accompanies these types of reviews; we don\u2019t want you calling up Google every time weird audiophile jargon is used.**Our Noise Cancelling Earbud Recommendations:*** [Apple AirPods Pro 2 Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Apple_AirPods_Pro_2_Earbuds)* [Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Sony_WF-1000XM5_Earbuds)* [Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Bose_QuietComfort_Ultra_Earbuds)* [Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Sennheiser_Momentum_True_Wireless_4_Earbuds)* [Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Samsung_Galaxy_Buds3_Pro_Earbuds)* [Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 Wireless Earbuds](https:\/\/astonmet.com\/noise-cancelling-earbuds\/#Jabra_Elite_10_Gen_2_Wireless_Earbuds)**Cracking the Active Noise Cancelling Earbud Code**Our review panel sat down with a notepad and pencil, intent on simplifying the sometimes technical language used when discussing earbuds.Earbuds are those contoured audio devices with tiny but powerful sound drivers that slide snugly inside an ear. Older models of these pocketable devices use slender cables and terminate in physical audio minijacks, but newer devices now use wireless Bluetooth.Another interesting little \u2018factoid\u2019 needs covering. All of the best noise cancelling earbuds have some form of background sound silencing ability. This is due to their snug fit, which creates a physical seal. This type of noise cancelling is known as passive, but it\u2019s not nearly as effective as the powered alternative.Active noise cancelling is where all the cool kids hang out. This is an electronic solution, one that generates anti-phase audio. Built-in microphones pick up the ambient sound and cancel these waves out before they reach the ear. High-end earbuds use ANC, plus a measure of passive noise cancelling, too.Other words to look out for include \u2018transparency mode\u2019 and \u2018latency.\u2019 Basically, a voice command or device touch allows outside noise in, perhaps to hear a teacher issue a homework assignment. \u2018My noise cancelling headphones were on\u2019 isn\u2019t going to work any better than \u2018the dog ate my notebook,\u2019 unfortunately. So listen to that teacher, use transparency mode. As for latency, that\u2019s the delay between playback transmission and earbud pickup.Factors like the Bluetooth codec and the physical form factor of your new earbuds will be weighed as this review progresses. Having said all that, it\u2019s time to dive into the first contender for best noise cancelling earbuds.**Choosing a Big Sound in a Tiny ANC Package**We learned several things while looking for the best noise cancelling earbuds. For one thing, comfort was more important than ever. There\u2019s something intimate about inserting in-ear devices, pressing their silicone or gel tips into your ear canal and letting them sit there for hours on end. Although it\u2019s likely the ANC earbuds you eventually pick will have them, do check to see that they\u2019re packed with plenty of differently sized ear inserts.Silicone is a staunch material for maintaining a physical seal, preserving the passive noise cancelling part of the hybrid sound muting relationship. It\u2019s also soft,  so you can\u2019t scratch the delicate skin lining your ear canal\u2014don\u2019t be a clumsy or impatient listener\u2014 when impatiently inserting them, and silicone tips resist skin oils and sweat.Fit is important, audio quality and balanced sounds are important, and so is a full-bodied bass that\u2019s tight and punchy, low enough to vibrate bone. Cross-genre sound profiles are also a game-changer, especially if the listener has eclectic musical interests or wants to put aside music altogether at the end of the day, say for an interesting new crime podcast. Fortunately, some of the earbuds on this list have special tuning capabilities, sending tones to the ear to model a signature sound profile or using machine learning to discover listener habits.Other features we\u2019d suggest investing a little money in, and research time, include spatial audio and head tracking technology. Sensors are inserted in the devices to detect motion and alter the perceived direction of the sound, creating a 3D soundstage. Call quality, by installing a high-performance microphone array, is also something busy audio enthusiasts might want to consider. For example, Galaxy AI can prioritize voices when you\u2019re talking to someone, then automatically raise the volume when the conversation concludes.Look for that feature on the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 earbuds. Alternatively, choose Apple AirPods Pro 2; their adaptive noise cancelling powers are lightning fast, courtesy of the H2 chip. As a final side note, don\u2019t underestimate a good semi-smart transparency mode; it\u2019ll keep you safe from dangers and late appointments, like messages announced on subway platforms.  Of course, transparency OFF and ANC ON, if you\u2019re just looking to avoid an awkward hello from your neighbor, all of these earbuds have you covered.","269":"in short: yes, if noise cancellation is not a must for youin depth:I initially intended to buy the pbp pro 2 for Christmas but they were out of stock and these buds were on a deal (100cad)for context, I have used or tried : galaxy buds live, galaxy buds 2, air pods gen 2, powerbeats pro and Sony xm3 ( their earbuds, I never remember their  names ahah)I was not hoping for much considering they were a \"low cost\" earbuds that were released 3 years ago, but they honestly surprised me to say the least. the sound quality is decent imo (relatively similar to air pods gen 2 I would say), the build quality is fantastic (good magnet, polished and sleek design, they don't feel cheap at all) and they really stay in your ear (if we exclude the powerbeat pro, they probably have the best hang on my ear out of all the earbuds I have tested)they also have a great software and get connected really easily.the main cons are:no transparency or noise cancelling: the biggest bummer. if this is important to you, you should probably consider the pros. I personally use my buse qc45 when really needing that noise cancellation so this doesn't really affect me.sound quality: really great for the average Joe but far from being on par with the much costly earbudsbattery life: 5h less than a lot of competitors,but it is really decent and the case last me around a week so not that big of a conoverall, they are really great day to day life. they have what the average Joe needs and nothing more. they kinda feel like the \"air pods of android\".

I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","272":"","273":"I\u2019ve preordered P9ProXL, but decided to play with the device in Best Buy first. What can I say\u2026 It\u2019s very similar to iPhone 15pm, screen is really really bright, I can\u2019t say the colors are amazing though. Somehow I like the colors on S24u better. I was shocked that camera takes so much time to take a shot. It\u2019s like you press a shutter button and it spins for like 500ms. It\u2019s much better on both iPhone and Smasnug! Photos are good as far as I could tell, but need to wait for full reviews to come out. Snappiness is\u2026 Not good. Sorry. S24u is miles ahead. Somehow it got stuttered in random places while scrolling. Screenshots app did not work - it kept saying nothing found. Studio app - Not sure what\u2019s the point of Gemini app just generates the same pictures? It also said that it could not generate people. Recorder app - I could not find how to generate a summary of conversation recorded. In photos app there was no option to try that generation feature with prompt. Weather app is a joke. As an AI summary it said - \u201cit will get colder in the next 4 days\u201d\u2026 Emm, I sorta can see it? Absolutely useless\u2026 Gemini Live (chat) was also not available on the demo unit..I\u2019ve canceled my preorder as I was really disappointed. They sounded like it\u2019s a premium phone that can compete with flagships during the presentation . In reality.. IDK.. I highly HIGHLY! recommend going to the nearest Best Buy and give it a good try. For me the phone felt like a ~$700 phone at max. $1199 is not its price. Just to make it clear I was comparing it with s24u and iPhone 15pm that I currently own. Was thinking to trade in s24u as the camera is trash in low light. But s24u is much much snappier\u2026 Will see what ai features will make it way to other devices :) But I have a suspicion that if you pay for Gemini you\u2019ll get a lot of them. ","274":"I pre-ordered the 8 Pro last year and it served me well for a year. All this while I did not consider buying the 9 Pro as it was just a minor upgrade from 8 Pro and didn't seem worth it.I'm based in Tokyo. I had some free time this week and my hands were itching. I noticed in the second hand market (Mercari, Yahoo Flea, etc) new unopened Pixel 9 Pro XL 128GB were going for as low $775 (\u00a5115,000). I spent some time monitoring and negotiating deals and got one for $675 (\u00a5100,000). The seller had just used it for 3 days, found it too big and wanted to get rid of it. He even provided me with the Google Store Bill, so I have warranty until August 2025. Japanese second hand markets are indeed known for quality and bargain prices. I then listed my 8 Pro on Facebook Marketplace and found a buyer within an hour to buy it for $600 (90,000) straight cash. (My 8 Pro is in mint condition and 256 GB version.) So net I went from 8 Pro 256 GB to 9 Pro XL 128 GB for $75. I've been using my 9 Pro XL for a day now, and ufff, I love it. It fixes all the small annoying issues I had with my 8 Pro, which otherwise was an excellent device. Straight away, I noticed these improvements that make the phone so much better:- Design! It just feels like a flagship. Much more premium. The 8 Pro looks like a toy phone next to it, especially if you have it in the Bay Blue color.- Connectivity! My 8 Pro would frequently disconnect from my home wifi and reconnect.- Battery life and charging!. My 8 Pro would often heat up and slow charge. The efficient G4 along with the better cooling system does seem to make a difference- Performance! Even though G4 is a minor upgrade from G3, the phone does feels much snappier with smooth scrolling on all apps, and the extra 4GB does Ram helps. - Front Camera! I found the face unlock to perform noticeably better. It still though doesn't work on dark  areas- 5x Zoom! It is way better on the 9 Pro XL, even though the cameras the same. - Brightness! The improvement in max brightness does help on a sunny day. Things which are the same but I wished were fixed:- You still cannot record 4k HDR at 60fps. Just the limitation of the processor- Battery still drains relatively quick when using the camera - Video is still jittery, especially if you're on 5x Zoom. Also transition between lens is still awful. ","275":"Been using my Pixel 4 XL for nearly 4 years now and it's been exceptional. Just changed the battery a while ago but that's about it. Everything works flawlessly on the phone. Face unlock is one of the highlights of the phone. It's phenomenally fast and works 99.9% of the time. Display is really nice too. It's so crisp and colours are nice too. Speakers are good too.Performance, i have to say is quite good too. Still runs so well in 2024. It does have micro stutters here and there but for the most part it runs really well. No complaints there. Haptics are nice too. I love the subtle haptic feedback you get when unlocking the device.All in all the Pixel 4 XL is still a joy to use in 2024. I can still get another year out of it easily and maybe more.","276":"Google released on January 8th 2025 Android version 13.0.0 TQ3A.230805.001.S2 to fix an alleged issue with the battery (https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/15701861), stating that the patch may make the battery of certain devices last for a shorter period of time and take longer to recharge! That sounded like a maneuver to force people to upgrade an otherwise perfectly working phone! Maybe the Pixel 4a model has been working too well for too long...Regardless, I took the chance and applied the patch to a Pixel 4a I have. The result was a disaster: the battery lasted one hour or less when fully charged; it took 4-5 hours to recharge it! For full disclosure, the battery of this Pixel 4a is about 70% of its initial factory capacity. Not bad for almost 4 year old phone. It still lasts most of the day with moderate usage. Then I decided to flash the phone with the latest before the last version of the system from November 2023 (S1) and everything was back to normal, except I lost some unimportant data (app configs and chat messages) and wasted a ton of time. By the way, the Android backup is completely unreliable! It doesn't really backup app data or at least not always and it doesn't restore everything the way it was at the backup point in time.Lesson learned: Don't install this update if you like your Pixel 4a because the outcome is unpredictable and most likely disastrous. Or do it at your own risk and be prepared to flash your phone with an older version, if you are capable.Reference on how to flash an image on a Pixel phone:https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/**UPDATE**I encourage everyone who has ugraded Android on their phone with the faulty patch, to flash the phone with version 13.0.0 (TQ3A.230805.001.S1, Nov 2023) using https:\/\/source.android.com\/docs\/setup\/test\/flash. It's all documented in the link https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/ above**UPDATE 2**~~I found another post where the author disables the package  com.google.android.factoryota responsible for downloading OTA upgrades using adb. I didn't test it myself but it looks correct. Note that the OP made a small mistake in its original post in the way the command was written, and someone subsequently corrected it. The correct command and reference are below.~~~~adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.factoryota~~Unfortunately what the author of the post below suggested doesn't work as the 4a doesn't have the factoryora package installed. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/s\/GUHjZtIfD8.","277":"Got my new Pixel 7a yesterday!

Also experiencing some network issues, but that's more about my room's location. Overall, I'm happy with the phone and think I made the right choice over the Moto Edge 50. Anyone else having similar issues or tips?","278":"I get so many calls every day, this is the list of voicemails, there's many more calls that don't leave voicemail.

I stopped answering unknown numbers and I report and block each one when I get downtime to do it.

I've had it over 4 decades. I'm on the do not call lost. It doesn't matter. Blocking does t work because the just spoof another phone number. Anybody find any solutions?","279":"A couple of weeks after enabling car crash detection on my Pixel 4XL, it came to my rescue. I have no recollection of how the accident happened. I just remember waking up in horrible pain struggling to breathe. Somehow, the Bobcat loader rolled off an embankment and ended upside down in a ravine. I yelled for help knowing it was futile when I heard a voice coming from the one earbud that manged to stay in place. To my surprise, it was an emergency dispatcher!  He told me that help was on the way and they had already contacted my wife. Within a few minutes, I heard the welcome wailing of a parade of rescue equipment.Once on scene, it took the firefighters of the Southern Platte Fire Protection District several minutes to locate the accident site. South Platte's bravest did a great job of removing me from the wreckage with minimal pain. That's quite an accomplishment considering the 7 ribs and 4 thoracic vertebrae that were broken when I'm assuming my back slammed against the ceiling of the Bobcat as it struck the ground. The accident occurred deep on my property and no one expected me back for a few hours, my phone was thrown out of site somewhere in the cab and I didn't have \"Hey Google\" enabled. It would have been a miserable wait.The fire station is at minimum 11 minutes from our property, so I'm assuming I was unconscious for at least 8 minutes while Google put our local emergency services into action. It would be interesting to know just how the process works. Does the 911 center receive a call from a digital voice?Thanks to my rescuers, medical team, and family; three months later, I'm back to 100%![images taken the day after](http:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/tbAbXg2)","280":"I have seen a lot of bad reviews\/complaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my (mostly) positive experiences. I bought my phone in 2021 and I've had an overall great experience. Pros: -fast and responsive-easily share files-cellular and data connection always great-multiple users worked seamlessly-photos and photo editing are good (my wife's Samsung seems to take better quality videos though) -Bluetooth connection to multiple devices easily -battery life adequate for my needs  Obviously it's not a perfect phone, some cons: -Android 14 update fiasco, couldn't save files, couldn't take photos for about 10 days -Android auto glitches occasionally, calls wouldn't connect to the car audio, but it must have been fixed since it hasn't happened in a few months -I miss the Pixel 5 back pingerprint sensor-when a phone call or notification interrupts playing music on phone (not connected to Bluetooth) it turns down the music volume after the notification  Considering all this, I still enjoyed the past 3 years with my phone. I'm interested in anyone else's Pixel 6 experiences whether positive or negative. ","281":"I\u2019ve been using iOS for a long time, but now I\u2019m ready to switch to Pixel. The ugly emoji on pixel (I know it's a dumb reason) and lack of a proper gallery app had been holding me back, since Google Photos is cloud-based, and I\u2019m not a fan of that. Does anyone else feel the same? Do y'all have a trusted gallery app recommendation?I'm planning to upgrade my phone by the end of the month and need some advice. I\u2019m torn between the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 8 Pro, and I\u2019m going for the 256GB version. I know the 8 Pro has the better camera, but does it also have all the AI features that the Pixel 9 offers? Which one would you pick and why? If you switched from iOS, how was the experience? Is transfer process from iOS to Pixel smooth? Are there any apps or data that don\u2019t transfer over?","282":"Fellow brethren, This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel, without sacrificing any features in the previous guides I've seen here.(Switching back to 60hz, uninstalling social media apps etc).So I've had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now. The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT, which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in (6hrs). Now as the days passed, I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery. I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta, so I switched over. Now the SOT became 6.5hrs. Not good enough. Then I took the steps below, and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly. It's also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc. I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi. Also bear in mind that I'm on A15 beta. The phone is flawless for me.1. Use a really good battery monitor. Pixel inline battery monitor is okay, but it's not great. BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors. But sadly it doesn't work on android 15 :( . So I used two: Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor. Both are really good. But Gsam has more data recording and visualization (graphs for heat, battery, CPU usage and a lot more). Also accubattery doesn't record how much battery the phone signal, WiFi, CPU, android system, Kernel etc use. While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone. You can get the premium versions from Mobilism (listed in the wiki of r\/piracy) which I think gives you some extra features. You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb.2. Install macrodroid and get the \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro from the macro repository inside the app. If you understand, feel free to move on to the next one, but  If you find the above sentence dense, here's a breakdown:Macrodroid is an app which executes macros(scripts) that you install on the phone. For example, you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone, or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etc.Now, there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itself(in the bottom panel and then search for it), and the one that you want to install is called \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro. This enables battery saver when the phone is locked. Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker. Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone! You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable android.permissions.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS via adb. (Don't worry, it'll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out.) Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally.3. Using savetuner. This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications. You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app. I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit (screenshot attached) to get real time updates from apps, but also put them into deep sleep otherwise. Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when it's locked! The phone also doesn't kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu! 4. Use 4G. I know this might be a deal breaker for some people, but for me it works great. I get the speeds I want from it, the phone doesn't heat up and stays cool. I also haven't had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc. Also, my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times, connected with my watch.5. (Optional) Using A15 beta. Things are much much smoother. The animations, the performance of the phone etc. If you do update, clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it. This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats. For some reason, this helps the battery life. I also have now playing, Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on.6. Debloat your Pixel phone. Yes, you heard me right. Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat, but it isn't. There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the background.There is an amazing FOSS app called 'Canta' which helps your debloat your phone. It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat. They have been tested such that, if you remove it nothing breaks. It has a description of what the app does if you click on it, so you can decide if you want to remove it. I've attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you don't lose any features. If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want, don't worry. You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app! (I don't use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc, so you don't find them in the save list. You can decide for yourself with the descriptions)7. Use the 20 - 80 rule. I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life. I use battery to check the current battery health (even though I doubt the accuracy). My last phone (Realme), I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule.8. Using Icebox and disabling background usage. Icebox is an app which disables any app that you select, when you lock your phone. My biggest standby drainers were Instagram,Snapchat and Mull ( a hardened version of Firefox). Mull has been fixed now so I've added Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox. Now this will freeze the app (like you disabled it), so you won't be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone. No worries, you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen! I've also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp, but this will result in you losing access to microphone if you minimize WhatsApp when during a call.9. Things I wish could improve: Video calling. I do a lot of WhatsApp video calls and this eats battery like crazy. I wish Google would improve the optimization of battery on video calls.10. If you reached this far, here's a BONUS tip! If you have rooted your phone, the Sultan Kernel for pixel 8 is an amazing option for battery and performance. I've heard reports of less heat, battery consumption and snappier performance. He's doing what Google Devs should do and for the benefit of the community. So check it out! Thanks for listening! I hope people can benefit from what I did so that you can enjoy your Pixel device. Let me know if you have any questions!","283":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","284":"Switching from a Google Pixel 8 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max was a decision driven by several critical factors that significantly impacted my daily use and overall satisfaction with the Pixel device.Firstly, one of the major issues I encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro was its abysmal battery life. Despite efforts to conserve power such as using low screen resolution and disabling unnecessary features, I could barely manage 3 to 4 hours of screen-on time on 4G. This severely restricted my ability to use the phone throughout the day without needing frequent recharges.Secondly, charging the Pixel 8 Pro was a frustratingly slow process, regardless of the charging method or accessories used. Even with fast chargers, the device took an unreasonably long time to replenish its battery, adding to the inconvenience caused by its poor battery longevity.Another significant drawback was the inconsistent performance of its 4G and 5G antennas. I frequently experienced dropped calls, slow data speeds, and poor signal reception in areas where other devices showed better connectivity. This unreliable network performance greatly hindered my productivity and communication while on the go.Furthermore, the photo and video editing capabilities of the Pixel 8 Pro fell short of expectations. Basic tasks such as trimming a short video clip often took an unexpectedly long time, which was frustrating when trying to quickly edit and share content. This sluggish performance impacted my workflow and creative projects negatively.In terms of overall performance, the Pixel 8 Pro lagged behind other flagship smartphones in its class. Apps frequently stuttered, and there were noticeable delays in executing commands and multitasking. This subpar performance was particularly disappointing considering the device's positioning as a premium smartphone.Lastly, the artificial intelligence (AI) features touted by the Pixel 8 Pro did not deliver as promised. While Google's AI capabilities are renowned, I found that the practical applications and user experience fell short of the seamless integration and usefulness expected from such technologies.Given these persistent issues and frustrations with the Pixel 8 Pro, I made the decision to switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone offered superior battery life, faster charging capabilities, reliable network connectivity, and smoother overall performance. Its robust ecosystem of apps and services, coupled with intuitive software features, addressed the shortcomings I experienced with the Pixel 8 Pro.In conclusion, my transition from the Pixel 8 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max was driven by a need for a more reliable and efficient smartphone experience. Despite the storage capacity difference, the iPhone's performance, battery life, and ecosystem better suited my professional and personal needs, providing a significant upgrade in usability and satisfaction compared to the Pixel.(i paid same price for the 15 pro max, just got 200 gigs less)","285":"Tried searching and saw a few posts like this but nothing recent. I recent switched from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Pixel 9. I also changed carriers and my port over is complete.I've tried ~50 times, and my iMessages and even regular SMS will not copy over. According to [the docs](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/7129740?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-wont-copy-during-setup%2Cwhat-copies-during-setup) >SMS messages and iMessages which includes photo, video, and other attachmentsSo this absolutely should work. I've tried the Back Up or Copy Data from the settings both during setup and after. Each time the same thing happens - I select messages, it looks like it's copying for 30 mins, then it completes and says \"no messages on device.\" I tried a factory reset and get the same results every time. My iMessages are synced with the iCloud, iMessage is turned off on the iPhone, and the SIM card is removed. Ive called Google twice - the first time it hadnt been a full 24 hours since the port so the rep told me to wait. The last time I called the rep asked if it was in iCloud etc and told me to go into a store.Does anyone have any idea what else I can try? I would like to avoid a third party app, and I really don't want to sit around in a store for an hour while they try what I've already tried ","286":"Sorry for the long post. TLDR at bottom. I got my first pixel phone in December of 2023. I had switched over from my Motorola Edge to the Pixel because my screen had cracked, and I didn't want to deal with trying to get the weird annoying screen fixed. So, I did some research, and I got the Pixel 8.   Jump to Halloween of this year. I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. Not soon after, the wireless charging stops working, which would normally not bother me too much, but when you're sleep deprived and waking up every 2 hours to feed a baby, it does make it super convenient to just put the phone down, instead of having to feel around in the dark for the charger. I troubleshoot. It isn't the charger, I check with my husbands phone. I reset the phone. Nothing. So I reach out to Google support, and they inform me that it can be fixed under my warranty. Great! They give me 2 options: get it done locally (which they say could be fixed as soon as the same day!) or send it in to Google. I go with the first option. It's only a little inconvenient because we have one car and a newborn, but my husband goes to drop it off for me. One problem, they don't have the part to fix it. That's okay, we can wait. They take my number and tell me that they will reach out when they get it in. This is at the beginning of the week of Thanksgiving. I call the next week, and they explain that the part isn't there yet because of holiday delays. I completely understand and I am not surprised. I ask them to call when they do get it. I don't get a call for a couple days, so I call and they say they have the part! Yay! It was around noon, and they said they could have it done in 3-4 hours. Awesome. My husband rushes it over. Long story short, the part is not the problem, so they tell me they will do a soft reset. The next day, they call and say that that didn't work either. At this point it has been about 2 weeks of trying to get this phone fixed, but I persevere. I go and pick it up, and the tech says that it's only something Google can fix, and that it is under warranty, so they should send a replacement.   I request a repair through them, and choose the mail in option (the other option is the local repair) in the Google Store. I am given the following instructions. 1.\u00a0Confirm that you\u2019re sending the right device.\u00a0If the device you send doesn\u2019t match the device in your repair order (same IMEI or serial number), we\u2019ll send you back the device without making any repairs.2.\u00a0Back up your device.\u00a0Make sure you\u00a0back up\u00a0all your information and\u00a0reset\u00a0your device before sending it. All data may be permanently erased from your device before we inspect and repair it.3.\u00a0Ship your device for inspection.\u00a0Follow the directions in your confirmation email to ship your device properly. If you\u2019re shipping a watch, keep your band and accessories with you, only send the watch case.  Here are the instructions from the email: # Shipping instructions1.Back up\u00a0your personal information.\u00a02. If the item has an IMEI or serial number, make sure it matches the one under the drop off code in this email3. Reset\u00a0your device to factory settings, then remove and keep the SIM card.\u00a04. Pack\u00a0your item into a box and bring it to a FedEx-supported dropoff location.5. Present\u00a0the drop off code below to FedEx clerk who will print your shipping label.6. You can track your return after it ships.\u00a0  Number 4 is the most important, that will come back to bite me right in the ass. I pack it up in the smallest box I could find, I place it back in the box I got when I had bought it, cushion with some parchment paper, and my husband drops it off at the Fedex. Good to go. This will finally be over.Cut to today, when I receive the notification that I have an email titled: Action Needed: Approve changes to repair order immediately. The repair details have been updated to the following: Camera problem - front, Outside frame or back cover damage, Battery problem, Power problem, Screen - lines or flickeringThat's not right, it should have just been the battery\/power problem. I am given 2 options: pay $150 for the repair or have them send the phone back to me. That's also not right, I have been told multiple times during this that it was covered under warranty. These were not issues when I got the phone back from the repair store or when I shipped it off. So, the only thing I can think is that it got damaged in transit. Which is very frustrating. I get in contact with Google support, and I ask what had happened to the phone. They can't give me anymore information than what I listed above. I ask if it was damaged in transit, and they can't give me that information. At this point, I just want to know the status of the phone, so that I can decide if I want to pay the 150 or just have them send me the phone back. They can't give me that information. They ask me if I had used Google packaging. HOLD UP. That was not an option at any point. I inform them of that. (look back up at the instructions from the email.) I am told that, next time, I should use Google packaging. I lose my mind. I am tired. I am covered in spit up and holding a crying baby. And none of that compares to the stress and disappointment about my phone.I have spent 3 weeks on this issue. On just my phone not wirelessly charging. Looking back, I should have just called it. It's not that big of a deal, I have other problems like having a newborn at home. I ended up cancelling the repair, and I request that they send it back to me. TLDR: I shoot a literal human out of my vagina and become a human milk bag, and that was easier than trying to get my phone fixed under warranty.   Hit me up if you want the transcripts from Google support. I thought the post was too long already. ","287":"Hey, Guys, I like to switch devices frequently for the sole purpose of trying them out. I used a Pixel 5a, 6a and 7 as main devices, used Pixel 1, 2, 3, 4XL, 4a and 5 as back-up devices. Also, I've tried to use iPhone Xr, Xs, 12 and more recently 13 Pro as main devices. Currently I'm switching back and forth between the iPhone 13 Pro and the Pixel 4a (yes, that's right) and I have to tell you, I'm enjoying the 4a much more. I'm not a power user who does a lot of mobile gaming, photo shooting and editing. I use my device for calling, texting, emails, social media, shopping and banking. Despite being 4 years old now, the 4a is more than capable of satisfying my needs, doesn't feel slow at all, biometrics are much better than recent Pixels, form factor is awesome; I like that's it's small and very light, sometimes I don't feel it in my pants, and most importantly very cheap, I don't need to be overly protective with it. Camera is very good for my use; regular photos come out sharp and nice looking, I rarely use a telophoto or an ultrawide lens. Coming to the most important factor which is software; androids in general and Pixel UI specifically is miles better than iOS, typing experience, notification control and files management are shitty on iOS. I don't like to keep many app icons on my home screen, only the most frequently used, on my Pixel I can easily access app library (drawer) and search for an application while on iOS it requires more steps. I don't use much customizations, but I'm more than comfortable with Pixel's UI limited options in that regard. If I want to highlight few negatives in my pixel 4a they would be few; the device's display gets really warm with prolonged or heavy use, I'd like to have toggles for Wifi and mobile data to be separated in the control center. Also, NFC on the 4a seems to be inferior to other higher end devices; it needs specific angles to work. Sorry for blabbing for so long but thought you might share some of my insights. Cheers. ","288":"Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been using the Pixel 8 Pro (P8P) for about half a year and the OnePlus 12 (OP12) for about a month. I thought it would be a good time to compare these two phones. As an Android Developer with 10 years of experience, I consider myself a demanding user who uses the phone for a variety of purposes including normal usage, fun, and work.To start with, I purchased the Pixel 8 Pro 12\/256 version for 1159\u20ac from the Google Store, which included the Google Pixel Watch 2 as a pre-order bonus. The OnePlus 12 (16\/512 version) was bought from TradingShenzhen for approximately 670\u20ac. Currently, the Pixel 8 Pro can be purchased for around 850\u20ac.**Let\u2019s talk about the packaging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro comes only with a USB-C cable, which in my opinion, is of really poor quality. I\u2019ve had connection issues with these cables from Google from time to time. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 comes with a 100W charger, a USB-C cable, and a classic case. Considering the package and price, the OnePlus 12 is a clear winner for me.**Moving on to the battery and charging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a 5000mAh battery while the OnePlus 12 has a 5400mAh capacity. But that\u2019s just raw data that anyone can Google. In practice, I find the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s battery to be quite disappointing. Despite numerous optimizations, I was only able to achieve around 5 hours of screen-on time (SOT) (with lower resolution, disabled 5G, location and other permissions disabled for most apps, and battery optimizations). On the other hand, achieving 7 hours of SOT on the OnePlus 12 is quite normal without any optimizations. I use both phones with lower resolution and higher refresh rate. The Pixel 8 Pro can be charged at a maximum speed of 30W, but we need a special charger for that (the same is true for the OnePlus, but they provide the charger). I tried charging the Pixel with a bunch of chargers that I have at home, and the maximum speed that I reached was 20W, which is quite poor. The combination of poor battery life and slow charging speed is really annoying. In this case, the OnePlus 12 with its 100W charging speed is the clear winner.**Let\u2019s discuss the screen.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a flat 1344x2992 6.70\" screen and the OnePlus 12 has a curved 1440x3168 6.82\" screen. Both are really great screens. The OnePlus 12 has slightly higher brightness and resolution. However, the main differences for me are that the Pixel\u2019s screen is flat and the OnePlus\u2019s is curved, and the screen color options (Google gives us 2 options and OnePlus gives us 3 options and an additional manual adjust option). The OnePlus 12 is my first phone with a curved screen and I often feel insecure about it. I\u2019ve stopped placing the phone screen down because I\u2019m worried about it. Also, when I look at the screen from a specific angle on the curved side, it looks strange (different colors). But for normal usage, it\u2019s okay, and gestures may be easier. If we are looking at specifications, the OP12 is the winner (higher brightness, higher resolution, and curved screens are more expensive), but for me, both of them are at a really high level.  **Performance \/ Heating**\u00a0  When it comes to efficiency and temperature management, the OnePlus 12, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, completely outclasses the Google Tensor 3 in the Pixel. The Pixel tends to heat up during normal usage on mobile data (LTE), and even more so during gaming, leading to a noticeable drop in performance. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 only gets slightly warm when unplugged from its 100W charger, and it\u2019s still cooler than the Pixel charging at 20W. Comparing the OnePlus 12\u2019s performance with the Pixel 8 Pro feels like comparing this year\u2019s flagship with a mid-range phone from 2020-2022. The OnePlus 12 is the clear winner here.**Connectivity**\u00a0  Connectivity might seem like an odd category, but it\u2019s quite important to me. I have the Chinese version of the OnePlus 12 (without eSIM), and I must say, I was initially worried about network coverage. However, it\u2019s noticeably better than the Google Pixel. Even when testing my Wi-Fi range, the results were shocking. I connected both phones to the same Wi-Fi network and moved to the farthest corner of my home. At this point, the OnePlus still had full range (4\/4), while the Pixel was down to half (2\/4). Running several speed tests, the OnePlus consistently achieved about 120 Mbps, while the Pixel only managed 20 Mbps - that\u2019s a five-fold difference! The OnePlus also outperforms the Pixel in terms of mobile data coverage.**Camera**\u00a0  I\u2019m not a professional photographer. Like most people, I use my phone\u2019s camera to share photos on social media or send them to friends and family. As we know, apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger tend to degrade photo quality, and in 2024, most flagship phones have good cameras whose potential we don\u2019t fully utilize. However, I did notice some differences between the two phone cameras. Both phones have quite good cameras, not the best on the market, but still very good. Pixel photos have more subdued colors, while OnePlus photos are brighter . Both companies should work on video stabilization. The Pixel has a slight issue with maintaining focus on one thing, making other elements a bit blurry. I like both cameras, and it\u2019s hard to choose a better one - they\u2019re different for sure. If you\u2019re interested, I can take some photos and upload them for comparison (we can do a blind test).**System**\u00a0  The primary reason I opted for a Pixel was its operating system. I was quite frustrated with certain aspects of Android that didn\u2019t function well, and I had heard that Pixels are akin to iPhones in the world of Android. Although I\u2019ve never owned an iPhone, I found little difference between Pixels and other brands. The same issues persist, such as missing notifications (a significant problem, I believe, with the Pixel 8 Pro), and apps being killed in the background. In my view, the main distinction between Pixels and other brands is the absence of certain features. Brands like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Samsung have their own software packed with useful features like Samsung Dex, app cloning, floating windows, etc. Thus, when the system\/software behaves similarly but offers less, the choice is clear.**Additional Annoyances on Pixel:*** As previously mentioned, I encountered issues with notifications. They can be delayed or may not appear at all when the phone screen is off. However, as soon as I turn on the screen, the notifications suddenly appear.* While using the \u201cX\u201d app on Pixel, I often found that post pictures wouldn\u2019t load as I scrolled. Occasionally, switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data or killing the X app and clearing the cache seemed to work. I never experienced this issue on other devices.**Additional Annoyances on OnePlus:*** The OnePlus weather app falls short when compared to the Pixel\u2019s. It\u2019s frustrating that I can\u2019t search for another town\u2019s weather without adding it, or view a more detailed forecast for another day without being redirected to a rather poor website.* I noticed that when I reset the phone (turn it off and then on again), some of my settings revert to their default values. For instance, I had disabled 5G, but it would suddenly be enabled again. Also, the order of my apps\/features in the notification bar would reset.**In Summary**\u00a0In my opinion, the OnePlus 12 significantly outshines Pixel 8 Pro, When compared to the OnePlus, the Pixel appears to be a mid-range phone from 2022, albeit with a commendable camera. The OnePlus 12 triumphs over the Pixel in numerous categories, including:* **Performance*** **Temperature Management*** **Battery Life*** **Charging Speed*** **Connectivity*** **Value for Money\/Box Contents**Pixel fight back only in the following areas:* **Camera Quality*** **Display Quality**","289":"I've been using the 9PXL for a few days now, and wanted to note a few things I like\/dislike between the two. Also want to just provide a little phone history I had before as this is not my first pixel**Context that may be helpful:**- Phone history: P3XL > P4XL > S21U > S22U > S23U > P9PXL- Service: US AT&T- S23U Was the 256 with 8GB of RAM- I never used the S-Pen - The trade in promotion I got basically gave me the P9PXL for  -$93 (like I made money with the gift card)**Here are the positives for me**- Battery \u2022 So far the battery life is holding up significantly better. (For example I'm 12 hours since my last full charge right now and I'm at 50%) s23U was even ran at a lower resolution to preserve battery. P9PXL is being ran at full resolution.- Visual voicemail \u2022 Visual voicemail is built directly in the phone app, where the s23U Has a separate app that was downloaded. this may be more of a stock android thing then a pixel thing but even with using the Google Phone app on the s23U Visual voicemail had to be accomplished with the app- Vibration motor \u2022 the vibration motor in the P9PXL is so much stronger, I can actually notice a notification in my pocket, where as on the s23U I would almost never feel notifications and would miss calls unless I had my watch on.- Network\/Modem \u2022 I have noticed significantly better data speeds on the P9PXL.- Space\/Scaling \u2022 The whole phone feels like it has more information\/text on the screen even though the screen size is the same (also could be a setting)- Focus mode \u2022 as a part of work life separation I use modes \/ focus mode where my Teams and outlook turn off outside of my working hours. On the Samsung making a \"mode\" you have to choose the apps that you want to \"allow\" during the mode. This is annoying as any time I download a new app I have to edit the mode to allow the app. On the P9PXL focus mode has you select the apps you want Disabled, meaning. I just have to select teams ans outlook once. (This may seem odd but its thought through a lot better)- RAM\/Multitasking \u2022 on the S23U since I had the 256gb it only had 8GB of RAM. Very often background apps would refresh due to lack or RAM, or web apps trying to upload a photo would be unsuccessful due to running out of system memory. So far the P9PXL has not ran into any of these issues**Here's what I'm missing\/Negatives**- Edge panel \u2022 this feature on the S23U has a floating tab on the edge of the phone. I used this for quick access apps and could be accessed on any screen when the phone was unlocked. For example I had calculator,  thermostat, Smart lights, Smart vehicles apps. [Edge panel](https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/uk\/support\/mobile-devices\/what-is-the-edge-panel-and-how-do-i-use-it\/#:~:text=The%20edge%20panel%20keeps%20the,and%20webpages%20alongside%20loads%20more)- Fingerprint Sensor \u2022 S23U fingerprint sensor was always live even when the screen was fully off, where on the P9PXL the screen or always on display needs to be active (however the P9PXL is so faster)- Camera Zoom \u2022 S23U could zoom 100X where Max zoom on the P9PXL is 30x**Other comments**- This phone feels just as snappy as the S23U if not quicker- Samsung Smart tag does not work with the pixel (thanks Samsung) - Samsung Galaxy watch 6 works perfectly fine on the pixel, even cellular - Galaxy buds work identically on both - New stock weather app feels very snappy, map loads fast since it's using Google mapsEdit: fixed a couple formatting mistakes ","290":"Bugs I Observed on Pixel 8:- Persistent Home Screen Icons for Uninstalled Apps: If an app with a home screen shortcut is uninstalled, the icon remains until the screen is locked and unlocked again.- Excessive Battery Drain: The battery drains significantly even when the phone is not in use, losing more than 30% over 6 hours of inactivity, compared to the usual 5-10% on other phones.- No Indication When Calls Are Answered: There is no vibration or sound to indicate when a call is answered, making it difficult to know without looking at the screen or hearing the receiver.- No option to check who connected to our mobile hotspot: There is no option to see who connected to our Hotspot. When I am friends some extra devices will connect. I want to check who is connected. Every phone has this.Features I Would Love in Pixel 8:- Double Tap to Turn Screen On\/Off: This would enhance user convenience.- Daily Data Usage Tracking: Currently, only monthly or app-specific data usage is available. Daily tracking would be very helpful.Features I Definitely Need in Pixel 8:- One-Tap Bluetooth\/Wi-Fi Toggle: It would be more efficient to turn Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on\/off with a single tap, rather than navigating through multiple menus.- Network Speed Indication: This feature would help monitor data consumption by apps and assess the quality of the internet connection.- Disable Automatic Wi-Fi Scanning: Wi-Fi scanning automatically turns on when I enable location services. I would like the option to disable this feature.Share you comments, maybe if enough people repost this. Google might implement atleast some of the features Upgrading phone should get more features. My Poco X3 has some quality features than pixel....Edit : When we are changing app grind in wallpaper and style preview of what we are setting is not showing","291":"Sooooo guys ! Here is my review after switching from iPhone to pixel and back to iPhone. I feel like I didn\u2019t give it enough time to grow on me since I ended up going back only after 7 days. Hear me out and see below the  pros and cons based on my 7 days ownership.Pros 1. Love love love the design! Is sick!2. The camera is on a different level for sure. Amazing picture taking3. Android autoplay- like it a bit better than apple carplay since it is more customizable. Example, you can have notification taken off from popping up on the car screen. However, to silent them you can't do it through The pixel you need to go through the auto play in the car. Cons1. Picture by picture videos don't have the rewind or forward tabs on it unless you do a double screen2. The back gesture is sometimes annoying when pressing to go back. Has to be a hard press3. I find that the notes app for google is pretty trash. Very unorganized4. Face id at night is a no go and also when you're wearing sunglasses5. When a viewing a picture or video you cant just swiped off it, you have to X it out of it 6. I feel like the battery doesn\u2019t last as much as an iPhone7. The camera lenses when zooming in and out is very very laggyTo conclude, I know all the cons sound like annoyance of mines and since I\u2019ve been using an iPhone since 2008  and I should had probably given the pixel more than just 7 days. Hope this helps anyone on the fence to switching. The pixel is a great phone, just not for me ( at the moment )","292":"Google released on January 8th 2025 Android version 13.0.0 TQ3A.230805.001.S2 to fix an alleged issue with the battery (https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/15701861), stating that the patch may make the battery of certain devices last for a shorter period of time and take longer to recharge! That sounded like a maneuver to force people to upgrade an otherwise perfectly working phone! Maybe the Pixel 4a model has been working too well for too long...Regardless, I took the chance and applied the patch to a Pixel 4a I have. The result was a disaster: the battery lasted one hour or less when fully charged; it took 4-5 hours to recharge it! For full disclosure, the battery of this Pixel 4a is about 70% of its initial factory capacity. Not bad for almost 4 year old phone. It still lasts most of the day with moderate usage. Then I decided to flash the phone with the latest before the last version of the system from November 2023 (S1) and everything was back to normal, except I lost some unimportant data (app configs and chat messages) and wasted a ton of time. By the way, the Android backup is completely unreliable! It doesn't really backup app data or at least not always and it doesn't restore everything the way it was at the backup point in time.Lesson learned: Don't install this update if you like your Pixel 4a because the outcome is unpredictable and most likely disastrous. Or do it at your own risk and be prepared to flash your phone with an older version, if you are capable.Reference on how to flash an image on a Pixel phone:https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/**UPDATE**I encourage everyone who has ugraded Android on their phone with the faulty patch, to flash the phone with version 13.0.0 (TQ3A.230805.001.S1, Nov 2023) using https:\/\/source.android.com\/docs\/setup\/test\/flash. It's all documented in the link https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/ above**UPDATE 2**~~I found another post where the author disables the package  com.google.android.factoryota responsible for downloading OTA upgrades using adb. I didn't test it myself but it looks correct. Note that the OP made a small mistake in its original post in the way the command was written, and someone subsequently corrected it. The correct command and reference are below.~~~~adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.factoryota~~Unfortunately what the author of the post below suggested doesn't work as the 4a doesn't have the factoryora package installed. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/s\/GUHjZtIfD8.","293":"I have seen a lot of bad reviews\/complaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my (mostly) positive experiences.

I finally treated myself to a Pixel 8 a month ago to celebrate a personal milestone. Coming from a Huawei Mate 10 Lite, Samsung A32, and Redmi Note 11, this phone is a HUGE upgrade. I'm absolutely blown away by the clean UI, the snappy performance, and those amazing haptics! And the camera? Forget about it, it's in a league of its own. I'm genuinely thrilled with my Pixel 8 and don't regret my decision for a second.However, I've noticed a few things over the past month that I wanted to share and get your thoughts on:1. I experienced a weird color shifts on the display when using adaptive brightness in direct sunlight. It's hard to describe, but the colors just look off. It goes back to normal as soon as I move out of the sun. Is this a known issue or just me?2. I've noticed a slight audio delay (about 0.5-1 second) when closing apps like Facebook or TikTok while a video is playing. The app closes instantly, but the audio continues for a moment before cutting off. Anyone else experiencing this?3. I feel like my battery life has taken a slight hit after the March update. It's not drastic, but it definitely feels like it was better before. I keep NFC, location, and mobile data off, while Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are always on. Any tips on optimizing battery life would be greatly appreciated!4. I'm using the vertical day\/date\/temperature lock screen style, but sometimes the At a Glance widget still shows up on top of it.Despite these minor issues, I'm still absolutely in love with my Pixel 8. It's truly a fantastic phone, and I'm so glad I made the switch.Thanks for reading my (long!) post. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!","295":"I have a pixel 7, my first pixel device. I almost always was an android user and I just have to say, pixel users are the most tolerant of their device manufacturer. Shitty battery, crappy fingerprint censors, weird screen lights, shitty UI bugs that shouldn't be on such a premium device all get the pass, largely.\"Oh for optimum battery life, charge between 20% and 80% when the moon is directly above you and the wind is blowing east.Finger print won't work 40% of the time? Did you try blowing on it? Trying in the dark? Removing other fingers? Shoving your thumb up your butt everytime you unlock your phone?

Forget in-box fast charger, there is no charger at all. Consumers seem to have largely just let this bs slide but it IS bs. But fine whatever.Other things that should NOT be in a google device this late in the smartphone game: Shitty cell reception. I mean c'mon man. Can't remove the google bar at the bottom..why? Can't toggle bluetooth on and off from the drop down menu, it has to open another mini-menu. Why? I don't hate my Pixel 7, but the best part about it is the updates, period. ALMOST every other feature can be found on a garbage budget phone, even the Chinese ones. I'm sure pixel 16 will be great when they release it in a few weeks, but I'm convinced the hype is just hype. Maybe I'll try Pixel 23 when it drops next year. Maybe not.","296":"I'll get right into it. I'm returning my Pixel 8 pro. I don't want to be labeled as a Pixel hater so I want to make sure there is some context. I have been a Google phones fan since the Nexus days. I bought the Nexus 4, 5, and 6P. Then, when pixel came a long, I bought the Pixel 6, 7, 7 pro, and now 8 Pro. I LOVE the Google software. I love the features such as live translate, the feature that tells you what song is playing and the advanced Google assistant. I also like the haptics which makes typing a pleasure. Finally, the camera is amazing. HOWEVER, all of this isn't enough to make me keep the phone. The Pixel 8 pro, at the end of the day, is a phone and it is not good at \"phone things\". The problems we've seen in the past (overheating, battery draining, and bad cell reception) are all here still. The cell reception one is awful. My wife's s23 ultra will have 5g with no issues and mine can't even load pictures on X. That causes the phone to heat up and the battery to drain. The battery is inconsistent. Some days I got 7 hours SOT. Somedays I struggled to get 4 hours. The overheating happens all the time whether maps is running or I'm just watching a YouTube video. As a result, the phone feels slow a lot more than I'd like from a phone this high end. These issues are critical to using a phone and the pixel 8 pro is just not good at them. Also, I, too, have the issue where the text appears pink or yellow instead of white on AOD, which affects the top or side of the display. And finally, the scrolling on Reddit is horrible. At the end of the day, this phone was the phone I've been waiting for all year. However, it needs a better chip. Tensor G3 is a failure in my opinion. The AI features are awesome but they are not enough to make this phone worth it. I look forward to the pixel 9. I'll be buying it and hoping they fix this year's issues. Peace \u270c\ufe0f","297":"I am a pixel user and am very proud of my phone. My father needed a new phone so I recommended him the Pixel 7 Pro since it isn't very expensive and I had found someone who was selling a \"sealed pixel 7 pro\" on facebook marketplace near me.We met up today and the box was actually sealed and everything seemed great. I paid the guy and went back home to unbox the phone. I still have my reaction on video when I opened the box for the first time, i was completely shocked to find the camera bump already heavily scratched. I thought \"Oh maybe its just refurbished, I don't really care anyways its gonna happen anyways\" So i flip the phone and peel off the sticker, just to find myself with a screen that doesn't look quite right...Upon further inspection there appeared to be another significant bump to the body on one of the corners, and after turning on the device I was greeted with a 720p resolution 60Hz and thick bezeled screen!!It immediately felt wrong and switching to 120Hz of course didn't fix anything. So I checked the IMEI number and the phone showed up to be Obisidian Black (mine was Hazel) and Verizon locked.And the guy I bought it off still says it's not his problem and that someone had gifted him this :(Now my father is okay with using this phone, it is still an upgrade over his last one, everything seems to be working fine on the phone except for the screen.My question is, is it safe to put his google account on this phone? Or will we be surprised once more when we find out something hidde. I did my due diligence to check everything and in fact everything seems legit.I need help  UPDATE: Still no conctact from the seller. Also not thinking of selling since I don't want to lie when I put up a listing or something. At this point my Dad really needs to use the phone. Is it a good idea to use it? I checked and the bootloader is carrier locked so I cannot completely flash the stock OS, but I did factory reset it and the android seems to be pretty legit as far as I know.  Is it safe to use daily? With his google account? I'm kind of a techie and I know my stuff and it seems to be safe, could there be something I'm missing?","298":"I wanted to detail my experience of using a Pixel 7a for close to 11 months. I bought one to be my daily driver, because where I live, the flagship was way too expensive and I wasn't sure how good or bad the experience would be. Initially, things were perfect. Loved the adaptive charging, UX, camera features. I even recommended my sister to get a Pixel 8.After about 3 months I started getting call drop issues. I found out it's a common one and occassionaly did restarts to counter the problem. My sister meanwhile was disillusioned with the camera (particularly colour rendering- she's a dentist and uses it to take snaps of teeth for aligning colour and send to labs) and she switched out for an S24 within 2 months. About 6-7 months later I started noticing flaws and bugs in the updates, found that night photography was not too good, and started getting a bug where the call button stopped responding. I had to restart the phone to reset this. There were some battery drain issues so I used to turn off location, Bluetooth etc to counter them. I liked it that updates were prompt and adhered to my company's policies. Finally, last Friday, I had an issue with my laptop and had to use my phone all day. For about 6 hours I couldn't make a single call and had to whatsApp people to call me. I was on a parallel work call on an app so I couldn't restart the device like I usually did. The mobile network kept cutting off once or twice as well, randomly. There were app issues where I couldn't make calls or mute myself, but that's on Microsoft, not a Pixel issue I hope.So on Friday night I finally broke down and placed the order.I had so much hope and really loved the UX. Unfortunately it was an experience which I would  never want to put myself in. If a phone doesn't do the basics of what a phone should, it just shouldn't exist. Just make a laptop or a tablet instead. I'm sure I won't buy a Pixel again, it was just so disappointing after all the hope and hype.","299":"I really want to love android. I have switched from an iPhone so many times but can\u2019t make it stick. Any advice?Hey! I am a lifelong apple user who has switched to android many times throughout the years but always end up switching back to iPhone. It\u2019s normally due to the fact that I am pretty deep within the eco system using things such as FaceTime, find my, and iMessage.However am a huge tech geek and love what android can do. I stay up to date on all of the developments with each phone manufacturer and obsess over switching.When a new phone comes out or a big update happens, I think maybe this time the switch to android will be the one that sticks. Once the sim is in an android phone, I tend to get frustrated with the change and then switch back. Maybe I\u2019m not giving it enough time? Or maybe I just need to accept IOS is better for me currently? Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what was the outcome?Update: I got the pixel 9 pro after talking with some of you all. Will post another update on 14 days.","300":"I purchased my Google Pixel 8 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB) last October. Yesterday, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Black, 512 GB). It's been 24 hours with the new device, so here\u2019s my honest experience:1. UI: The Pixel has a cleaner UI that feels faster but tends to stutter. Apps like Reddit, Twitter, and even some websites on Chrome lag while scrolling. The Pixel has good animations and responsive haptics. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's One UI is super smooth and feels more like a premium device. Scrolling is noticeably better\u2014on the Pixel 8 Pro, one swipe gets me about 11 posts down, while on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the same swipe moves through 20 posts. The Pixel UI feels tight, while One UI slides more fluidly. I used to think the Pixel UI was fast, but now I know what fast really is. It's like people saying 60Hz is fine until they experience 120Hz.2. Performance:  I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because of overheating issues with the Pixel 8 Pro. For example, one day, while trying to book a cab using multiple apps with mobile data and location on, the Pixel 8 Pro got extremely warm within 5 minutes. It became uncomfortable to hold, and when I took it out of my pocket, one of the cab apps had crashed, and the battery had drained by 10% in just 15-20 minutes. As a longtime Nexus and Pixel user, this was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how this phone is supposed to handle 7 years of software updates. After getting the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I transferred my data using Smart Switch, and it only got mildly warm during the setup. Once it was set up, the phone frame felt cool to the touch. Even after watching a YouTube video in 4K for 40 minutes, it didn\u2019t get warm at all. The device is snappy and feels like you\u2019re typing on a slab of glass, unlike the Pixel's velvety feeling. Also, the Pixel gets quite warm when charging with a 20W PD charger, which is not ideal.3. Battery: Battery life was another major reason for switching to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Pixel's battery tends to die on long workdays. Even with adaptive charging, by 7 PM, it\u2019s often down to 18% after moderate use. The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is inconsistent\u2014some weeks, it lasts all day, and other times, it struggles to make it through. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with Google\u2019s updates, but the battery performance seems to fluctuate.On the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I charged it to 100% yesterday at 7 PM, and now, 23 hours later, it's still at 40%. I\u2019m confident it can easily last a whole day with heavy use. The battery management is impressive.4. Extras: I do miss the \"Best Take\" feature on the Pixel and the ability to take screenshots and copy text from the recent menu. However, Samsung\u2019s feature granularity is impressive. The S-Pen is decent; I expected it to be as good as the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s not quite there. Still, I enjoy the functionality of the stylus and the sound it makes when writing notes, like writing on coarse paper.5. Camera: The camera isn't my primary concern, which might be why I was able to switch away from the Pixel more easily. The Pixel\u2019s camera is excellent, producing very natural-looking photos. The Samsung camera is good for most situations but doesn\u2019t quite match the Pixel's photo processing quality. In conclusion, the Pixel\u2019s UI is better and feels very user-friendly, but the Tensor G3 chip seems to hold it back. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers a superior experience, but you wouldn\u2019t realize this unless you use both phones for a while. For me, the ideal phone would have the UI and camera of the Pixel and the hardware of the Samsung. But that's a dream for another day.","301":"I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","302":"I pre-ordered the 8 Pro last year and it served me well for a year. All this while I did not consider buying the 9 Pro as it was just a minor upgrade from 8 Pro and didn't seem worth it.I'm based in Tokyo. I had some free time this week and my hands were itching. I noticed in the second hand market (Mercari, Yahoo Flea, etc) new unopened Pixel 9 Pro XL 128GB were going for as low $775 (\u00a5115,000). I spent some time monitoring and negotiating deals and got one for $675 (\u00a5100,000). The seller had just used it for 3 days, found it too big and wanted to get rid of it. He even provided me with the Google Store Bill, so I have warranty until August 2025. Japanese second hand markets are indeed known for quality and bargain prices. I then listed my 8 Pro on Facebook Marketplace and found a buyer within an hour to buy it for $600 (90,000) straight cash. (My 8 Pro is in mint condition and 256 GB version.) So net I went from 8 Pro 256 GB to 9 Pro XL 128 GB for $75. I've been using my 9 Pro XL for a day now, and ufff, I love it. It fixes all the small annoying issues I had with my 8 Pro, which otherwise was an excellent device. Straight away, I noticed these improvements that make the phone so much better:- Design! It just feels like a flagship. Much more premium. The 8 Pro looks like a toy phone next to it, especially if you have it in the Bay Blue color.- Connectivity! My 8 Pro would frequently disconnect from my home wifi and reconnect.- Battery life and charging!. My 8 Pro would often heat up and slow charge. The efficient G4 along with the better cooling system does seem to make a difference- Performance! Even though G4 is a minor upgrade from G3, the phone does feels much snappier with smooth scrolling on all apps, and the extra 4GB does Ram helps. - Front Camera! I found the face unlock to perform noticeably better. It still though doesn't work on dark  areas- 5x Zoom! It is way better on the 9 Pro XL, even though the cameras the same. - Brightness! The improvement in max brightness does help on a sunny day. Things which are the same but I wished were fixed:- You still cannot record 4k HDR at 60fps. Just the limitation of the processor- Battery still drains relatively quick when using the camera - Video is still jittery, especially if you're on 5x Zoom. Also transition between lens is still awful. ","303":"I see there's been an influx of users due to recent Black Friday sales, so I want to express some things I use daily that make my pixel experience all the much better. I'm really hoping to explain some nuances that people don't tend to know about Pixels rather than tap build number to get to developer settings. Been a user of the 1, 2 XL, 6, and 9 and I follow many smartphones closely, but I find navigating the pixel to be the most intuitive and fun. OneUI has improved over the years but it still feels \"bloated\" at times and iOS just feels like corporate board room boring. Enjoy._________________________* Homescreen Tips * Holding an app on the homescreen or app drawer will bring up a shortcuts sub menu. You can actually grab some of the shortcuts and pull them right onto the homescreen for quicker access to your youtube subscriptons for example. * Alternatively, pressing down kinda hard works a few milliseconds quicker than the hold gesture (super subtle, but since Android 10, it can detect hard presses similar to Apple's 3D touch years ago via software by judging how far and fast the surface area of your finger hits the screen. [Source](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/3\/21162272\/google-pixel-feature-drop-firm-press-3d-touch-card-boarding-pass)) and it feels like you're clicking the icons to get the shortcut out. Try a gentle touch long hold vs \"clicking\" your phone like you would a laptop touchpad and you can see it's a tiny bit faster. This applies anywhere on the phone for highlighting text and whatnot too. * A lot of things that you can search for in the swipe up app drawer search can also just be dragged onto the homescreen for faster access; contacts from various other social media apps, shortcuts, etc. * App drawer can also search for the settings within the Settings app to save an extra step.* Navigation tips * Start from home screen > swipe up from app drawer > search for \"gestures\" and go into that in your Settings and there's a fun page * Quick Tap (double tap the back of your phone) for flashlight is probably my most used feature. * One-handed mode is awesome for pulling down notification when swiping down past the bottom of your phone. I use this regularly, too. * With swipe gestures, swiping left and right switches through your recent apps quicker. * In the recent apps menu, you can tap the app icon on top to splitscreen it with another app * In the recent menus, you can copy text from anywhere, even inside of images * In the recent menus, you can copy and share images much more quickly without ever having to save them to your camera roll* Gboard tips * Swipe across spacebar to slide edit cursor * Grab backspace and swipe backwards to delete by words at a time * Phones are tall enough to support a number row always available * Tap the top left icon with the 4 boxes for keyboard widgets * You can drag and drop them around, but just play around. I personally love clipboard history and the new document scanner* Circle to Search * I use it as a faster way of sharing cropped screenshots for the most part * You can use circle to search to force pinch zoom anything to get a better accurate circle * Live translation of text anywhere, even in images and raw manga * Finding music by humming * Circling items in videos when I want to know more info about it* Lockscreen Tips * The biometrics improve over time with every unlock. Starting with the Nexus phones, Google introduced [Nexus Imprint](https:\/\/www.xda-developers.com\/nexus-imprint\/), later rebranded to Pixel Imprint; it's a tech that lets your phone learn a bit more about your finger print with every unlock. You can actually test this by checking an area of your finger that won't scan in, and then slowly inching your way towards that area until it will also unlock your phone. * Make sure to enable screen protector mode in the settings and redo your finger scans if you have a screen protector.","304":"Google released on January 8th 2025 Android version 13.0.0 TQ3A.230805.001.S2 to fix an alleged issue with the battery (https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/15701861), stating that the patch may make the battery of certain devices last for a shorter period of time and take longer to recharge! That sounded like a maneuver to force people to upgrade an otherwise perfectly working phone! Maybe the Pixel 4a model has been working too well for too long...Regardless, I took the chance and applied the patch to a Pixel 4a I have. The result was a disaster: the battery lasted one hour or less when fully charged; it took 4-5 hours to recharge it! For full disclosure, the battery of this Pixel 4a is about 70% of its initial factory capacity. Not bad for almost 4 year old phone. It still lasts most of the day with moderate usage. Then I decided to flash the phone with the latest before the last version of the system from November 2023 (S1) and everything was back to normal, except I lost some unimportant data (app configs and chat messages) and wasted a ton of time. By the way, the Android backup is completely unreliable! It doesn't really backup app data or at least not always and it doesn't restore everything the way it was at the backup point in time.Lesson learned: Don't install this update if you like your Pixel 4a because the outcome is unpredictable and most likely disastrous. Or do it at your own risk and be prepared to flash your phone with an older version, if you are capable.Reference on how to flash an image on a Pixel phone:https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/**UPDATE**I encourage everyone who has ugraded Android on their phone with the faulty patch, to flash the phone with version 13.0.0 (TQ3A.230805.001.S1, Nov 2023) using https:\/\/source.android.com\/docs\/setup\/test\/flash. It's all documented in the link https:\/\/developers.google.com\/android\/images\/ above**UPDATE 2**~~I found another post where the author disables the package  com.google.android.factoryota responsible for downloading OTA upgrades using adb. I didn't test it myself but it looks correct. Note that the OP made a small mistake in its original post in the way the command was written, and someone subsequently corrected it. The correct command and reference are below.~~~~adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.google.android.factoryota~~Unfortunately what the author of the post below suggested doesn't work as the 4a doesn't have the factoryora package installed. https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/s\/GUHjZtIfD8.","305":"I was bored at work and went down a rabbit hole of music and car content on TikTok.  Unplugged from charger at 3pm and it's currently 7:40.   Better sell the thing and buy an iPhone...\/S just in case.   Just posting a positive shot of the battery life since every other battery life post seems to play like pixel devices are terrible.  I've not had a single day at work 8 or 12 hours where I have had to charge this thing since the first week or so I've owned it.  It's even learned my rotating shifts BS schedule with the adaptive battery ","306":"The last few weeks I've been so back and forth on whether I wanted to get the S25 or Pixel 9 Pro. Coming from the S24 Ultra, I knew I wanted a smaller phone and it was between these two. I've had both in the past but way more Samsung and love the customization One UI offers. But the simplicity and Pixel UI was appealing to at least try. After not being able to decide, I tried something crazy. I preordered the S25 and bought a Pixel 9 Pro. Now before you all say I have too much money, yes I was able to afford it BUT I did so knowing that there is a return policy on both phones and I will be returning the one I don't like as much. Of course I was able to get the Pixel first (S25 was delivered today). First impressions of the Pixel are that it's an amazing device that feels very premium. And much smaller and lighter compared to the S24 Ultra. Pixel UI has come a long way since I last use it and it runs super smooth. Still, there are things I can't do on Pixel that I can do on Samsung (examples are way more lock screen and AOD customization, the close all button not being right below your task changer, no edge lighting, and many more). But I thought I would be able to get by without these because the Pixel really is a solid phone and I would get used to it. But then my S25 was delivered. Immediately upon picking it up, while on paper it doesn't look crazy, it's quite a bit smaller and lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro. I was amazed how it feels and love the all matte finish. And then as I started playing around with One UI 7, I remembered how much I love to tinker with things that Pixel doesn't offer. Long story short, the Pixel is going back. Don't get me wrong, it's a great phone and I can see the appeal and why people love it (haptics and weather app are absolutely incredible). But for me, I need to tinker and play around with random things on my phone so we are sticking with team Samsung. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. ","307":"I have seen a lot of bad reviews\/complaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my (mostly) positive experiences. I bought my phone in 2021 and I've had an overall great experience. Pros: -fast and responsive-easily share files-cellular and data connection always great-multiple users worked seamlessly-photos and photo editing are good (my wife's Samsung seems to take better quality videos though) -Bluetooth connection to multiple devices easily -battery life adequate for my needs  Obviously it's not a perfect phone, some cons: -Android 14 update fiasco, couldn't save files, couldn't take photos for about 10 days -Android auto glitches occasionally, calls wouldn't connect to the car audio, but it must have been fixed since it hasn't happened in a few months -I miss the Pixel 5 back pingerprint sensor-when a phone call or notification interrupts playing music on phone (not connected to Bluetooth) it turns down the music volume after the notification  Considering all this, I still enjoyed the past 3 years with my phone. I'm interested in anyone else's Pixel 6 experiences whether positive or negative. ","308":"2 things in particular - I used to be able to set timers, change the song on Spotify, etc with Gemini like Google Assistant used to do. About a week ago, it started saying things like \"Sorry, I can't help with that. You can set or adjust the alarm on most devices by using their built-in clock apps.By the way, there are some extensions that require Gemini App Activity to work. You can turn this on at Gemini App Activity.\" Gemini App Activity has been turned off since I got 3he phone months ago so that setting hasn't changed at all.  Anyone know how to get these features working again with Gemini?Second thing is this weird response I got yesterday. (Screenshot)Without being promoted, it started listening while I was talking to my roommate and picked up what looks like gibberish then gave me weird responses including informing me that Gemini is, in fact, not a minor. Based on what it picked up, I don't know how it'd be led to thing I was asking for something inappropriate relating to minors. Gemini seems to have gotten dumber and more useless since I got the Pixel 9 XL Pro Ultra Omega whatever that call this shit now. Anyone else experiencing the same thing? ","309":"I have a pixel 7, my first pixel device. I almost always was an android user and I just have to say, pixel users are the most tolerant of their device manufacturer. Shitty battery, crappy fingerprint censors, weird screen lights, shitty UI bugs that shouldn't be on such a premium device all get the pass, largely.\"Oh for optimum battery life, charge between 20% and 80% when the moon is directly above you and the wind is blowing east.Finger print won't work 40% of the time? Did you try blowing on it? Trying in the dark? Removing other fingers? Shoving your thumb up your butt everytime you unlock your phone? Getting down on your knees and begging the device?My pixel still overheats pretty quick, despite the fix they pushed through an update. I don't game...I don't even use social media. Forget in-box fast charger, there is no charger at all. Consumers seem to have largely just let this bs slide but it IS bs. But fine whatever.Other things that should NOT be in a google device this late in the smartphone game: Shitty cell reception. I mean c'mon man. Can't remove the google bar at the bottom..why? Can't toggle bluetooth on and off from the drop down menu, it has to open another mini-menu. Why? I don't hate my Pixel 7, but the best part about it is the updates, period. ALMOST every other feature can be found on a garbage budget phone, even the Chinese ones. I'm sure pixel 16 will be great when they release it in a few weeks, but I'm convinced the hype is just hype. Maybe I'll try Pixel 23 when it drops next year. Maybe not.","310":"Hi all,As many others on this sub, I have bought the Pixel 9 Pro XL.While the phone in general is great, me and a few other redditors have noticed issues with the touch sensitivity on the bottom corners of the touchscreen. This only applies to *TAPPING* in the corners. Sliding your finger from a different place on the screen towards the corner works flawlessly and is registered perfectly.As it's still really early and many people have only just received their devices, we're curious if this is a software or a hardware issue.If everyone with a Pixel 9, Pro or Pro XL that reads this would be willing to perform a test, that would help me (and others) a lot in narrowing down the issue at hand. \ud83d\ude4f**THE TEST**1. Open the \"Phone\" app (the one where you dial numbers)2. Enter the following on the keypad.```* # * # 7 2 8 7 # * # *```This opens the \"Pixel Diagnostics\" app - this is completely safe to use. Press \"Confirm\".3. Scroll to the \"Screen\" section and press \"Touch Panel\"4. Press \"Start\"5. You will see a completely green canvas. Tap your finger in the outer most corner for both the bottom corners. It is important that you **tap** your finger, don't **drag** your finger from another part of the screen to the corner. Just tapping. This is very important.---Please write the following in the comments.**No issues on my [phone model]** - if the corners immediately turn white on the very first tap. Repeating the test shows the same result every time.**Slight issues on my [phone model]** - if the corners turn white on some taps. It is inconsistent. When the test is repeated, it seems to work better\/worse between tests.**Same issues on my [phone model]** - if the corners never turn white when tapping the corners. It is obvious that the tapping in the corners is not registered properly.---Thanks in advance for helping me and a few redditors out in our research. It would massively help us in determining if we have faulty units or if this is a wide scale issue.*EDIT*Thank you all so much for your responses - it's definitely a relief to see a lot of you also have these issues. Thanks to u\/Large-Fruit-2121 and his research we can now be very confident it's a software issue.

I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","312":"This is a long post for those of you who might consider buying yourself or someone else an iPhone.So I've been a pixel fan for a while, I had the nexus 5, 6, 5x, and loved every one.But after one small stint on a Samsung, I was unimpressed. (happy to talk about this comparison too)So I decided after years on hating on Apple, I decided to give it a good old college try with the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021.At first I loved it, it was responsive, the apps were well designed, it's just a pretty polished experience.Then the little things wrong just started to pile up.NATIVE APPSNothing wrong with facetime, imessage, airdrop, etc. But their Google equivalent is just as good. So it wasn't like this life-changing thing that iPhone users made it out to be. Kind of confused why they're so popular. Maybe because they're ignorant of what Google has? IDK. It's bizarre.NAVIGATION OF THE UII'm also dumbfounded about the swiping navigation on iPhone. You can go back a page by swiping from left to right, but only if it's an app that supports gestures in-app. Which means there are many apps that don't support the \"back\" gesture, and only have an arrow to go back at the top left corner of the screen. ...WHAT?! So I can't go back a page if I'm holding my phone in my right hand. ...WHAT?! So basically, if the gesture method doesn't work, I have to do some kind of hand gymnastics just to navigate within an app. That's crazy. This was a huge hole in the idea that iOS was \"polished\" or \"cohesive\".NOTIFICATIONSAnd notifications...by FAR the MOST infuriating thing on iOS. Sure, you can customize where the notifications show up, (lock screen, banner, notification center), you can select if it makes sound or not, or if you want it in your summary, all good options to have.But if you want to select which kind of notifications you get from an app, the in-app settings better have an option to disable certain ones, or else you have to disable ALL notifications from that app. That leaves it up to the developer to tell you what kind of notifications you get to see. Oh and if you get a notification you don't like, you don't have the option to change any notification settings from the notification itself. You can turn all of them off or all of them on. That's it. Can't even swipe them away in any direction either. it's only from right to left. THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE BACK SWIPE GESTURE.The design is atrocious, stacking is ugly and cluttered. You can't even take any action from the notification itself unless the app has enabled it. You have to open each app to do anything with that notification like 50% of the time. It's totally random what you can and cannot do with a notification on any given app. Just a guessing game, hoping and praying a feature works. Gross.SILENT MODEAlso, an easy feature android has ALWAYS had that iOS just doesn't care about (?!?!?!?) is a VIBRATE-ONLY mode. WHY NOT HAVE THIS?! It would be so easy and make so much sense. It would work great with the mute switch, because you could decide if mute = silent, or vibrate only. This is just a blatant \"we don't really care what the users want\" problem.SIRIAnd the ugly nuisance that Apple is somehow still proud of, Siri. She activates when she's not supposed to, doesn't understand basic requests outside of math equations and timers. You want to ask a general knowledge question and have her answer you by voice? SHE CAN'T DO THAT. She can display search results on screen. THAT'S IT. Can't make a phone call to a public number unless it's in your contacts, doesn't work while driving (only calls to contacts and texts), and REGULARLY miss-understands my non-accented California English. I NEVER use it. It's faster, much more effective to open the google app, and tap the microphone, and ask Google. It rarely lets me down. My google home is a blessing when I get home because it just works.PHOTOGRAPHYI'm a photographer, and love pushing mobile imaging to the limit, and don't get me wrong, the video looks great, but the photos...They're serviceable. That's it. Never shocked me at how good they were, how much color, dynamic range or detail they have. I was never impressed. Just satisfied. I still prefer to bring a camera with me even if my iPhone could take the photo decently. It almost always blows out the highlights and darkens the shadows even with HDR enabled. I'm constantly using the exposure slider to adjust what it thinks is the right level.And the portrait mode...what a PAIN. Being in a VERY specific window of distance from the subject for the effect to work at all is SO annoying. I'd have to ask people to stand still every time, while I do a weird one step forward, two steps back dance trying to take a picture. I hate it. And FORGET about taking a portrait image of an object. The iPhone has no clue what it's looking at.None of this was ever a concern on the Pixel. It just worked and would regularly blow me away.CONCLUSIONSo my wife got the Pixel 6 last year, and every time I use it, I'm looking at the photos, the UI, the colors, the screen, and the beautiful, unobtrusive hole punch camera and saying to myself, \"dang, I shouldn't have switched at all.\" That's what I thought at first, but I actually am glad I did try iOS, because now I have conducted an experiment with experience, and I can conclude that pure Android on a Pixel is THE mobile experience to have.And now I'm just counting the days until I pay off this iPhone and trade it in for a Pixel 8 when it comes out. I was not crazy about the Pixel sizes being so big, but at this point, that's not enough of a reason to keep me from it.I am a little hesitant about the video quality and editing ability on mobile, but at this point, it can't be bad enough to keep me from switching.I already exclusively use google cal, photos, and chrome, so the transition won't be hard. I just have to sell my Apple watch (which I actually love) because it only works with iPhone. (SO STUPID)If you're at all curious, absolutely try it out for comparison's sake, but don't lock yourself in. It's not as good, they don't update features as quickly as they need to compete. No feature they have is worth giving up ALL the advancements that Android makes constantly.To the Pixel community: I'm sorry I left for two years, I'm coming home soon.TL;DR:tried ios for two years, so many infuriating things add up to a sub-par experience. I miss pixel. I'll probably buy the P8.","313":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","314":"Short summary: if you're two minded, go for it, and no you don't have to get the lastest model if you don't have the budget.Intron: I went from android to ios, then back to android with this guy. So this explain a lot why I don't have problem with batter life.There's a few reasons on why you would like to own a pixel device and we are here to talk about them(There's no special order to it)1. You like photography, but you don't have 3-5k to spend on a professional camera, or you just want to have one in your pocket2. this one might be silly but it's true, You want a pixel cuz YouTubers say, I mean for me, marques ALONE was enough 3. you want to be different from others while having a reliable phone too4. You just like the looks of it5. you want your phone to do things others can't ( not iMessage shit) i mean like type to call and this pixels exclusive things6. you're a tech nerd, and you want to install custom os's such as graphenSo reason number 1 detailes: yup, It can take pictures like a pro, it's not magical though, don't expect it to capture a big volcano while you only point it at a rock.And in my experience, nothing beats apple in family\/friends photos. Don't be that guy who ruin the family photo just to show off to apple fanboys that their android can take better pictures, yes it can but NOT in that scenario, leave family photos to Iphones and save your camera and your passion for photography, for wildness.Reason  2: the reveiws are true, but don't do it if you have no other reasons Reason number 3: now that you're special, know that there isn't any accessories for it, this one highly depends on where you live, for example in US it's fine but In someplaces pixels are RARE, amd the accessories for them? Impossible to foundReason number 4: personally, I like square corners, like 7a or s24 ultra or nubia, sony,.... But unfortunately they are changing itReason. Number 5: yes, It does them, they are not gimmicks, they work 100 percent of times, at least for me, and some of them are really helpful, for example the alarm in the morning, you can choose the sound directly from yt music or Spotify, you can have weather forecast after your alarm, you can set it to play news or podcasts and ..... Tons of smart thinga which you have to find your own use usecaseReason number 6. I don't have any experience myself, but I've heard that pixels are friendly for this stuff","315":"For me:**Google Pixel 2:*** **EE (UK):** VoLTE - **\u2705** , VoWiFi - **\u2705*** **Vodafone (UK)**: VoLTE - **\u274c**, VoWiFi - **\u274c*** **O2 (UK):** VoLTE - **\u274c**, VoWiFi - **\u274c*** **Three (UK):** VoLTE - **\u274c**, VoWiFi - **\u274c****How to check:** use code \\*\ufe0f\u20e3 #\ufe0f\u20e3 \\*\ufe0f\u20e3 #\ufe0f\u20e3 4\ufe0f\u20e3 6\ufe0f\u20e3 3\ufe0f\u20e3 6\ufe0f\u20e3 #\ufe0f\u20e3 \\*\ufe0f\u20e3 #\ufe0f\u20e3 \\*\ufe0f\u20e3 and check phone information section.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/j63fxy0a1jne1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66a8bffe0f54be0b1fc3e4b05ad0ed61be415ea5**My story:**My **Pixel 6 Pro** died a week ago, and I decided to use my prev phone **Google Pixel 2**. And I was surprised that everything worked well (data, sms), but not calls (income or outcome). And I found out that my Network Carrier Three (UK) switched off support of 3G, and regardless that Pixel 2 supports LTE, the Carrier did not provide config for the phone for enabling the feature inside network. I tried to have many calls to support without any luck, they even did not understand what I asked them exactly.See Config Pixel 2 for my current Carrier Three (UK) by the link below, you can see that VoLTE and VoWIFI are disabled regardless the phone supports the features[https:\/\/devicesupport.three.co.uk\/guides\/device\/Google\/Pixel2#l=threeukcust&lHsim=threeukcust&d=Google\/Pixel%202&s=LCX\\_Root&loc=threeuk&hsimSpinner=true](https:\/\/devicesupport.three.co.uk\/guides\/device\/Google\/Pixel2#l=threeukcust&lHsim=threeukcust&d=Google\/Pixel%202&s=LCX_Root&loc=threeuk&hsimSpinner=true)Like [George Cordos](https:\/\/support.google.com\/profile\/25611375) said:>Well, we still have this annoying \"dance\" between Google and the operators. Google says the operators don't support the device, the operators say Google needs to enable the settings to automatically provision the device. Years later, still unsolved. With the July 2021 update, the bulletin said something about enabling VoLTE for several operators, but it seems not for most European ones. Such a pity.So, I visited main Carriers in the UK and found out that my Pixel 2 could work only with **EE (UK)**, because only the Carrier provided correct settings for my phone (see screenshot above). And I currently in proccess of moving my phone number from Three Carrier to EE.Also, I did read that Network Carriers only care about configs for iPhones and Samsung phones mostly.So, I really wondrer, how is your Pixel device supported in your country?Could you please share with us your Network Carrier (Country) and support by them VoLTE and VoWiFi feature for your Pixel Device please.Please use reply by country if it is possible.

[...] Is it white white? Or slightly off-white, like bone?and by my questions\/doubts before purchasing\/receiving the device (is it white? Is it as porcelain as the Pixel Fold? Or more \"pure\" white like the snow Pixel 7\/a and Pixel 3?), I am figuring other people may have the same doubts.Since I now have the device, I just thought I'd take a couple of comparisons pictures for the sake of clarity.I must emphasize how much of the actual whiteness tone that you perceive looking at the attached picture is going to be affected by my Pixel 8 Pro's camera, lighting conditions when I took the pictures, and calibration of your own display. So don't take this comparison as a \"oh okay, I see that white, that means the porcelain colour really is **that** colour\". Don't. Just use the pictures to judge the different tone compared to other already known\/familiar whites.That's why I included in the images the clearly white Pixel 3 and the two Pixel Stands (1st and 2nd Gen). I could have added the Pixel Buds Pro case and white Pixel XL too but... I forgot, and now can't be half arsed to redo everything \ud83e\udd23 (unless there's someone who specifically need it, in case let me know).To be clear, the Pixel 9 Pro (non-XL) and the Google case are both \"porcelain\" colour.Now, personal thoughts: I went with this colour because I absolutely dislike the hazel\/gray one, and the black\/obsidian didn't feel \"black\" enough (I like black only if it's a deep deep black). I usually like pure white phones and stuff (Pixel 3 indeed - but also loved the super white Pixel 7 and 7a), but I was concerned that the \"porcelain\" Pixel 9 Pro wouldn't be really... White (well, it's probably not called \"something white\" for a reason). Having seen the official images\/renders on Google Store and the previous Pixel Fold, I was expecting a very *champagne* sort of porcelain.So I was pleasantly surprised when the reviews came out, and I could see the porcelain was actually rather white! But I always wondered whether that had to do with colour grading etc.So, when I received the device and unboxed it, I finally saw the actual look. The impression was that it was definitely *less* white than I had come to expect (and wish) following what I had seen in the reviews, however it was still whiter and less \"warm\/gold-ish\/champagne\" than what the official renders made it look.So, not my ideal pure white, but not even the very-off porcelain white that I initially feared it would be.It's just... An average off white.The case, on the other hand, is a slightly different off white, which I'd place in the middle between the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 9 Pro.If anyone has better pictures showing the tone more accurately next to some other white products, feel free to share them!https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/UyR7BZHEdit: oh, a sort of disclaimer. I am colourblind so take everything with a grain of salt \ud83e\udd23","317":"Just got my 5a working on Verizon.  It took a lot of trial and error and web searching to get it up and running.  It's so new, Verizon's internal documentation doesn't cover how to provision it yet and not all the Tier 1 support reps know about it.  There are three steps that you can't do on the web.  A human will get involved at some point.To set it up:1. Make sure your plan includes \"5G Nationwide.\"  This is the plan that supports the sub-6 LTE band that 5G uses.  The \"5G Ultrawide\" plan won't work.  That's for the mm-wave band, which this phone doesn't have.  If you have a 4G plan maybe, maybe they'll tell you before you provision but not if you try to SIM swap, without human intervention, which you can't do anyway (see below).2. Turn off \"Chat Features\" in Google Messages on your old phone before you turn it off.  Maybe this should be step minus one.3. DONT use your old SIM card.  4G SIMs don't work, and some 5G SIMs don't either (see CDMA-less below).  Don't use any SIM card, actually, use the eSIM.4. Call [Verizon](https:\/\/www.verizon.com\/support\/knowledge-base-230702\/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D87545943369363174833733019823386778116%7CMCORGID%3D777B575E55828EBB7F000101%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1630114046) and get them to email you a QR code for the eSIM.  When you do, be sure to use IEMI2.  That's a TWO.  The second IEMI number.  The number of the count shall be two.  Thou shalt not count to one, excepting to count to two.  Three is right out.  If I could read, I could have avoided a lot of pain at this step.  For reference only, IEMI1 (that's a **one** if your font can't distinguish \"I\" and \"1\") is for the physical SIM slot, which if you followed step (3) you're not using.5. **Make sure they set it up as a \"CDMA-less\" device**.  This is the killer mystery [undocumented](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/thread\/122943951\/i-cannot-receive-any-text-messages-on-my-google-pixel-5a-but-can-send-text-messages-with-no-problem?hl=en) step.  Ask for it by name.  This may require special Tier 2 support sorcery, but my support person knew how to do this without transferring me.  If you don't do this, your text messages will pile up in the ether and return to you in a flood when you finally get it provisioned correctly.  The state of setting up messages from here depends on your app.  The important thing is to make sure no other messaging app is still lurking as you somewhere.6. If you must use a SIM, be sure to get a new 5G SIM, not the 4G SIM or an old 5G SIM.  The only reason to go this route is if you don't want to wait on hold forever to get one emailed to you.  Even then, they must know this new SIM is bound for a CDMA-less device.One more edit:  your phone may need a restart for all this to work.  After I did the CDMA-free trick, messages worked but phone calls quit.  A power-off-power-on made everything work again.Someday, Verizon may automate the process of generating eSIM QR codes.  We can all hope.I made 5\/6ths of these mistakes over the weekend.  Enjoy.&#x200B;\\--SRF","318":"Sorry for the long post. TLDR at bottom. I got my first pixel phone in December of 2023. I had switched over from my Motorola Edge to the Pixel because my screen had cracked, and I didn't want to deal with trying to get the weird annoying screen fixed. So, I did some research, and I got the Pixel 8.   Jump to Halloween of this year. I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. Not soon after, the wireless charging stops working, which would normally not bother me too much, but when you're sleep deprived and waking up every 2 hours to feed a baby, it does make it super convenient to just put the phone down, instead of having to feel around in the dark for the charger. I troubleshoot. It isn't the charger, I check with my husbands phone. I reset the phone. Nothing. So I reach out to Google support, and they inform me that it can be fixed under my warranty. Great! They give me 2 options: get it done locally (which they say could be fixed as soon as the same day!) or send it in to Google. I go with the first option. It's only a little inconvenient because we have one car and a newborn, but my husband goes to drop it off for me. One problem, they don't have the part to fix it. That's okay, we can wait. They take my number and tell me that they will reach out when they get it in. This is at the beginning of the week of Thanksgiving. I call the next week, and they explain that the part isn't there yet because of holiday delays. I completely understand and I am not surprised. I ask them to call when they do get it. I don't get a call for a couple days, so I call and they say they have the part! Yay! It was around noon, and they said they could have it done in 3-4 hours. Awesome. My husband rushes it over. Long story short, the part is not the problem, so they tell me they will do a soft reset. The next day, they call and say that that didn't work either. At this point it has been about 2 weeks of trying to get this phone fixed, but I persevere. I go and pick it up, and the tech says that it's only something Google can fix, and that it is under warranty, so they should send a replacement.   I request a repair through them, and choose the mail in option (the other option is the local repair) in the Google Store. I am given the following instructions. 1.\u00a0Confirm that you\u2019re sending the right device.\u00a0If the device you send doesn\u2019t match the device in your repair order (same IMEI or serial number), we\u2019ll send you back the device without making any repairs.2.\u00a0Back up your device.\u00a0Make sure you\u00a0back up\u00a0all your information and\u00a0reset\u00a0your device before sending it. All data may be permanently erased from your device before we inspect and repair it.3.\u00a0Ship your device for inspection.\u00a0Follow the directions in your confirmation email to ship your device properly. If you\u2019re shipping a watch, keep your band and accessories with you, only send the watch case.  Here are the instructions from the email: # Shipping instructions1.Back up\u00a0your personal information.\u00a02. If the item has an IMEI or serial number, make sure it matches the one under the drop off code in this email3. Reset\u00a0your device to factory settings, then remove and keep the SIM card.\u00a04. Pack\u00a0your item into a box and bring it to a FedEx-supported dropoff location.5. Present\u00a0the drop off code below to FedEx clerk who will print your shipping label.6. You can track your return after it ships.\u00a0  Number 4 is the most important, that will come back to bite me right in the ass. I pack it up in the smallest box I could find, I place it back in the box I got when I had bought it, cushion with some parchment paper, and my husband drops it off at the Fedex. Good to go. This will finally be over.Cut to today, when I receive the notification that I have an email titled: Action Needed: Approve changes to repair order immediately. The repair details have been updated to the following: Camera problem - front, Outside frame or back cover damage, Battery problem, Power problem, Screen - lines or flickeringThat's not right, it should have just been the battery\/power problem. I am given 2 options: pay $150 for the repair or have them send the phone back to me. That's also not right, I have been told multiple times during this that it was covered under warranty. These were not issues when I got the phone back from the repair store or when I shipped it off. So, the only thing I can think is that it got damaged in transit. Which is very frustrating. I get in contact with Google support, and I ask what had happened to the phone. They can't give me anymore information than what I listed above. I ask if it was damaged in transit, and they can't give me that information. At this point, I just want to know the status of the phone, so that I can decide if I want to pay the 150 or just have them send me the phone back. They can't give me that information. They ask me if I had used Google packaging. HOLD UP. That was not an option at any point. I inform them of that. (look back up at the instructions from the email.) I am told that, next time, I should use Google packaging. I lose my mind. I am tired. I am covered in spit up and holding a crying baby. And none of that compares to the stress and disappointment about my phone.I have spent 3 weeks on this issue. On just my phone not wirelessly charging. Looking back, I should have just called it. It's not that big of a deal, I have other problems like having a newborn at home. I ended up cancelling the repair, and I request that they send it back to me. TLDR: I shoot a literal human out of my vagina and become a human milk bag, and that was easier than trying to get my phone fixed under warranty.   Hit me up if you want the transcripts from Google support. I thought the post was too long already. ","319":"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to a Google Pixel 9. I am liking it so far, but I have several frustrations with it; bearaly enough to almost break the camel's back and go back to iPhone! I was wondering if anyone can give me advice or thoughts. 1. Battery is not as expected. I was expecting to get about 13 hours on on-screen battery life, but I am not getting close to that! I am getting around 8 hours. I recently found the issue, or what I think the issue is at least. After I use android auto, it keeps running in the background all day and drains all of my battery!2. When using Spotify to listen to podcasts, every time a notification comes in, it pauses the podcast, plays the notification sound, and 75% of the time, it resumes the podcast. The other 25% of the time, it will remain paused for no reason. 2.5. Sometimes the podcast will pause altogether on its own, and then I have to press play to resume. 3. When using Android Auto, WhatsApp voice messages will not play. The music volume will lower, but the messages will not play. 4. Whatsapp does not ring on Android Auto, only on the phone, so there is no Whatsapp interface on AA. 5. On the contrary, there is no phone call interface on the phone when you're talking through a regular phone call on Android Auto; it only shows in your car's screen. Which means that you cannot activate a feature like Call Notes while driving. 6. Aggregation of health app data-- on iPhone, all health app data would aggregate on Apple Health and every app would have every other app's data. The equivalent on Android, health connect, is simply not good. I use FitBod for strength training and MyNetDiary for calorie tracking. On iPhone, calories would automatically be aggregated through apple health and would automatically reflect on MyNetDiary, but it is failing to do so using Health Connect. It shows up as a workout on MyNetDiary, but none of the important information (like calories) aggregates correctly, so I must input it manually.  Does anyone have any solution to these or can share their thoughts? I really really want to stay on Pixel\/ Android forever so I hope I can get at least some of these things fixed so that I don't have to go back. ","320":"Hello everyone,I am writing this post because I want to share my (ongoing) experience with Google's repair service.First, I purchased the Google Pixel 8 from a third-party store.The phone arrived with the now common issue of random reboots. As soon as I encountered this problem, I contacted Google's customer service, who offered me a free repair.This is where the interesting part begins. I contacted Google support via chat, and the operator created the repair order for me because I couldn't do it on my own.I went to the order summary page and proceeded with the acceptance. Upon acceptance, shipping labels with UPS were generated. I shipped the phone the same day. The day after shipping, I noticed from the tracking that the package was marked as damaged.At that point, I contacted UPS, who told me that since I hadn't created the label myself, there was nothing they could do. So, I contacted Google by phone and spoke with Damiano. He very kindly told me that the repair order had been made by choosing to take responsibility for any damage during transportation. However, I never had the option to choose; the operator who created the repair order chose for me without telling me. Additionally, he told me that the phone had been sent to the wrong repair center because it had UK warranty. Again, the chat operator didn't inform me of this.Upon hearing this, Damiano escalated my case to an \"internal team\" for further verification.Since then, no communication from Google has been received.At a certain point, I saw from the tracking that the shipment was no longer marked as damaged and that the delivery was scheduled for Monday.However, Google's repair order page didn't update, and it didn't show as delivered to them.Three days passed, and one evening I received a text message from UPS saying that the next day they would deliver a package from GOOGLE STORE.The package arrived, I opened it, and noticed that the box seals were broken. Inside, I didn't find my device but an old, dirty Huawei.So, I called Google again and spoke to a representative. After several minutes of waiting, she couldn't give me any answers but promised to check with the \"internal team\" and get back to me within 24 hours.The 24 hours haven't passed yet, but I haven't received any response.I'm seriously considering filing a police report because I feel robbed.Do you have any idea how I could proceed in this situation? I just don't want to have lost my money.","321":"I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","322":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","323":"Hi everyone. I hope this area is okay for the problem I have. I recently purchased a Pixel 9 from the Google Store and financed through Google Synchrony. I was given $240 credit for my iPhone 12 trade in. I then decided to return the Pixel 9, and I purchased (also from the Google Store) a Pixel 9 Pro using a credit card. So, I was under the belief the $240 iPhone credit would be refunded to the credit card I used to purchase the 9 Pro. Or at least the $240 credit could be sent to PayPal, or something like that. But today I see the $240 was issued as Google Store credit, which I don't want at all.Even though Google advertises \"fast and easy\" returns, for me it was not. It's like a maze trying to communicate directly with someone there. I called several phone numbers, only to be routed in circles by automated responses. When I finally spoke to someone, they just hung up on me. Twice! The third time I called I asked him why he keeps hanging up on me. He denied it. He said someone would call me at 10 AM the next day, and of course that never happened. I finally was able to communicate with someone by email. Anyway, back to what my question is. Has anyone else had a similar situation? If you resolved it to your satisfaction, how did you do it? I thought I would try to get a heads-up before I try talking with anyone at Google again. Thanks","324":"Just got my 5a working on Verizon.  It took a lot of trial and error and web searching to get it up and running.  It's so new, Verizon's internal documentation doesn't cover how to provision it yet and not all the Tier 1 support reps know about it.  There are three steps that you can't do on the web.  A human will get involved at some point.To set it up:1. Make sure your plan includes \"5G Nationwide.\"  This is the plan that supports the sub-6 LTE band that 5G uses.  The \"5G Ultrawide\" plan won't work.  That's for the mm-wave band, which this phone doesn't have.  If you have a 4G plan maybe, maybe they'll tell you before you provision but not if you try to SIM swap, without human intervention, which you can't do anyway (see below).2. Turn off \"Chat Features\" in Google Messages on your old phone before you turn it off.  Maybe this should be step minus one.3. DONT use your old SIM card.  4G SIMs don't work, and some 5G SIMs don't either (see CDMA-less below).  Don't use any SIM card, actually, use the eSIM.4. Call [Verizon](https:\/\/www.verizon.com\/support\/knowledge-base-230702\/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D87545943369363174833733019823386778116%7CMCORGID%3D777B575E55828EBB7F000101%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1630114046) and get them to email you a QR code for the eSIM.  When you do, be sure to use IEMI2.  That's a TWO.  The second IEMI number.  The number of the count shall be two.  Thou shalt not count to one, excepting to count to two.  Three is right out.  If I could read, I could have avoided a lot of pain at this step.  For reference only, IEMI1 (that's a **one** if your font can't distinguish \"I\" and \"1\") is for the physical SIM slot, which if you followed step (3) you're not using.5. **Make sure they set it up as a \"CDMA-less\" device**.  This is the killer mystery [undocumented](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/thread\/122943951\/i-cannot-receive-any-text-messages-on-my-google-pixel-5a-but-can-send-text-messages-with-no-problem?hl=en) step.  Ask for it by name.  This may require special Tier 2 support sorcery, but my support person knew how to do this without transferring me.  If you don't do this, your text messages will pile up in the ether and return to you in a flood when you finally get it provisioned correctly.  The state of setting up messages from here depends on your app.  The important thing is to make sure no other messaging app is still lurking as you somewhere.6. If you must use a SIM, be sure to get a new 5G SIM, not the 4G SIM or an old 5G SIM.  The only reason to go this route is if you don't want to wait on hold forever to get one emailed to you.  Even then, they must know this new SIM is bound for a CDMA-less device.One more edit:  your phone may need a restart for all this to work.  After I did the CDMA-free trick, messages worked but phone calls quit.  A power-off-power-on made everything work again.Someday, Verizon may automate the process of generating eSIM QR codes.  We can all hope.I made 5\/6ths of these mistakes over the weekend.  Enjoy.&#x200B;\\--SRF","325":"**Phone History**  - Pixel 2  - Pixel 5  - Solana SagaSo I'm currently eying up to replace my current phone and I'm currently torn between the Pixel 9 Pro and trying out the iPhone 15. I don't really care for waiting for the 16 to come out and compare.I have some concerns of staying Pixel side, though it would be my prefered choice and these mainly include:    - Historically poor support for anything googleWorkspace domain related (I've had my account since it was marketed as G-Suite for familes for like 10+ years).For what ever reason Google HATES workspaceDomains and old G-Suite users to the point where I can't even convert my nest account to a Google Account because it's a workspace account. I also remember a time when we couldn't even use google assistant properly and we couldn't even set reminders because of the google account type.To this day I still can't even signup and convert my fitbit account either because it's a workspace account so a lot stuff Google does really does ick me! There was also some smart home support issues I believe with workspace accounts but that's mostly a non point now I've built out Home Assistant.- Poor support and implementation for \\`Find My Phone\\` and the new devices that have come out using the \\`Find My Network\\`, where some network settings have been made opt in so most people are not going to actually use that. Where as Apples \\`Find My\\` network is opt out so it has a much greater network for their Airtags.**Considerations**I seem to travel a fair bit for work now and I'd like to have a decent tracking system for luggage\/bags\/equipment so Airtags are appealing to me currently.I'd like to stay Pixel side but honestly the poor workspace account implementations and lack of \\`Find My\\` network puts me on a 50\/50 fence between Pixel 9 and iPhone 15.You could say I could get a Samsung S series and use the SmartTag2's but I'm not overly fond of Samsung for some reason and not something I'm really considering at the moment.So I'm stuck between iPhone 15 for Airtags and tracking or the Pixel 9 and hope their \\`Find My\\` network improves and they don't screw over \\`workspaceAccount\\` users more.Honestly if I could just combine Pixel 9 Pro with Apples Airtag network I'd be a happy boy!Just looking for some sanity in this situation.","326":"Hello everyone,I am writing this post because I want to share my (ongoing) experience with Google's repair service.First, I purchased the Google Pixel 8 from a third-party store.The phone arrived with the now common issue of random reboots.

The thing is, I have VERY specific demands, and so far I am not sure whether or not these phones actually meet my requirements, or to be more precise, which of these would compromise my experience the least.To make it clear, I will provide a list of what I am looking for in a smartphone, sorted by priority (top = highest priority), especially in photography and taking high resolution images.1. High resolution images which are sharp WITHOUT aggressive sharpening\/filtering\/post processing, straight from the sensor of ALL lenses except the front camera (RAW files!)2. RAW files which allow for quite a bit of editing, say the dynamic range should be wide enough to correct shadows and highlights3. Full manual control over the photos via camera2api (white balance, shutter speed, ISO, RAW\/JPG etc.)4. Full manual control over the videos via camera2api (white balance, shutter speed, framerate, ISO, LOG profile color, high bitrate mode, image stabilisation active\/deactivated etc.)5. Very good battery life6. Google Pay needs to work flawlessly7. Android Auto should work flawlessly with an AA Wireless Dongle (P30 Pro only connects correctly if the Display is unlocked while unlocking the car, if the P30 Pro was in Standby, usually Google Maps doesn't work\/screen of Android Auto stays black, I hate that)8. Face unlock should work great, along with Fingerprint scanning9. Double tap to wake10. Screen projection should work in 16:9 so it completely fills the entire TV (don't care if it's wireless or by cable)11. An always on display with notification icons&#x200B;What is of absolutely NO interest to me (not just of little interest, I mean literally no interest at all\/don't care):1. AI editing of photos\/videos like that magic eraser\/magic mic stuff on the Pixel, this stuff is annoying and of such low quality that I will not use any of this, I am using Photoshop professionally since Photoshop 5 (not CS5, I literally mean version 5 from 1997). Again least interest in these quality-ruining features, the quality should come from the hardware, not \"fixing in post\"2. Front camera (I would be happy with a 20yo VGA front facing camera, I don't take photos with it at all obviously)3. Gaming\/Performance of the processor (I just need performance for 4k video, snappy photo taking, anything else processor-related is of no interest to me)4. Display&#x200B;So with these things out of the way, I am not sure which phone to get to be honest.In Germany, right now I could get the 512 GB versions for \\~1200 \u20ac (Google) or 800 \u20ac (Honor) respectively. What I don't know (because I obviously don't own any of these phones) is whether or not they actually support the first 4 points of my priority list. I heard that on Google Pixel 7 Pro the Tele lens offers no manual controls for example in third party apps.Is there anyone out there who could confirm if the Pixel 8 Pro actually allows full manual control over video by using the ProShot app for example? ProShot would allow to, for example, set the resolution to 4k, framerate to 24, shutter speed to 1\/48s (I use an ND filter to compensate a too bright image), bitrate to 80+MBps and be able to lock the white balance\/focus etc.? Would this be possible on ALL lenses on the Pixel 8 Pro?Same question for the Honor Magic5 Pro. Coming from the Huawei P30 Pro I have the problem that the Kirin SoC and Huawei's EMUI never gave proper access to the cameras using camera2api, meaning you can't set many things manually like white balance on the ProShot app (only on the native app), taking RAW files is not possible either. For video it's even worse, in 4k you are stuck with 30fps only on the P30 Pro, you can't go down to 24 fps for example if you wanted to. LOG curve is not available either. Since the Honor Magic5 Pro probably inherited quite a lot of EMUI's quirks (MagicOS is based off EMUI after all), I can imagine that all these features I mentioned in points 3 and 4 are not supported here either, which would be a big nono for the Honor Magic5 Pro for me.&#x200B;Having said that, the Honor Magic5 Pro's GN2 sensor (1\/1.12\") seems to be far superior (hardware-wise before the software kicks in) compared to the Pixel 8 Pro's GNV sensor (1\/1.31\"). I read many articles and I was especially disappointed in the Pixel 8 Pros straight-out-of-camera JPG photos. They are sporting a ton of artifacts, oversharpening, too much denoising killing off texture and making areas look mushy or like an oil painting, probably to make the photos look crisp on a small and bright display like the Pixel actually has instead of a monitor\/print. My question here would be: Are the 50 MP RAW files actually more usable, as in, they are not killed with all the AI post processing and still offer a decent amount of detail I could unveil using Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop? That's what I am interested in.&#x200B;Let me give you an example from GSM Arena and Chinahandys, straight out of camera 50 MP JPG images and Nightsight images:Google Pixel 8 Pro:[https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/google\\_pixel\\_8\\_pro-review-2629p5.php#image29](https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/google_pixel_8_pro-review-2629p5.php#image29)[https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless\\_pixel\\_8\\_pro\\_main\\_2.jpg](https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless_pixel_8_pro_main_2.jpg)&#x200B;Honor Magic 5 Pro:[https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/honor\\_magic5\\_pro-review-2543p5.php#image27](https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/honor_magic5_pro-review-2543p5.php#image27)[https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless\\_honor\\_magic5pro\\_main\\_3.jpg](https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless_honor_magic5pro_main_3.jpg)&#x200B;Comparing these 2 shots, I would definitely pick the Magic5 Pro over the Pixel 8 Pro, here's the reason why:&#x200B;[Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Honor Magic5 Pro](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ergba610lo1c1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1585ecab89fdc163874553f768c1bac434c4d887)&#x200B;These shots make me question all the results from YouTube reviewers and also from articles like DXOmark and Dpreview, because clearly the Pixel 8 Pro does have issues and is far from being best-in-class (that would be, at least in terms of photos, the top models from Huawei, but they don't have access to Google Play Services and are therefore, sadly, no option for me).&#x200B;So what I would like to know: Can any Pixel 8 Pro or Honor Magic5 Pro users confirm which camera features are accessible through the camera2api, and, which would be even better, provide some decent 50 MP photos of the respective device which they deem to be of high quality for that device? I don't care if it's straight out of camera or edited in Camera Raw from a DNG file. As long as it does represent the maximum quality of either of these smartphone cameras.&#x200B;I found two examples which do give me some hope though that the Pixel 8 Pro actually produces good quality photos at 50 MP. One of them is this one:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/3442313345](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/3442313345)  Here's the JPG version of it, straight out of camera (again, oversharpened, artificial look, loss of texture and detail all around with way too much contrast:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL\\_20231008\\_152706673.jpeg](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL_20231008_152706673.jpeg)Same shot exported from the RAW file without adjusting any settings apparently:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL\\_20231008\\_152706673\\_acr1.jpeg](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL_20231008_152706673_acr1.jpeg)&#x200B;This one of the Pixel 8 Pro looks pretty okay though, straight out of camera:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/4553953025](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/4553953025)On the other hand, I don't know how the Honor Magic5 Pro would have performed for these two shots. Maybe even better.&#x200B;A few more example shots from users who know what they're doing would be gladly appreciated to make up my mind by myself. It's a toss coin for me at the moment with the lack of information out there. Maybe the confirmations about manual controls in video etc. I mentioned in my list can make me lean towards the Google Pixel 8 Pro despite being 50% more expensive, which is a lot.&#x200B;Thanks for the read, hope to get some good replies with no brand bashing!","328":"so sorry if y'all are tired of me posting about this here, but as promised, here's my week in battery update (as well as interesting new developments from like literally 5 minutes ago)*this'll be a bit long, using speech to text on my pixel to help lol*so like I said last week I did a factory reset and clean install of my pixel 8 pro, not restoring from a previous backup but setting it up as a brand new phone and for the first 5 days it was honestly fantastic. I was getting fantastic battery life, averaging 6 to 7 hours of screen on time with at least 25 to 30% still left (honestly had to force myself to be on my phone that long tho lol). I was very happy with the results. Then on Monday night I ended the day with about 55% and I decided to actually not charge my phone that night and to instead charge it up in the morning before I left (I usually wireless charge it overnight, but I have a power brick that supports the max 30 watt wired charging, which honestly is notably faster than with the 7 pro). Unfortunately that day I woke up later than I wanted to but still plugged in my phone while I got ready. I unplugged my phone at about 91% and left. Unfortunately for whatever reason, the phone decided to drain really quickly that day, despite me using it as I would normally use it. I got back to my home about 12 hours later with 16% left with about 2 and 1\/2 to 3 hours of screen on time. Much worse than my previous days. I chalk it up to being a fluke and just wireless charge it overnight that night as I usually do.next morning I wake up leave my place around 11:30ish at 100%. I restarted the phone that morning just to be safe. but for whatever reason, the standby time that following day was not the greatest. it seem to be draining rather quickly, despite the fact that I wasn't on my phone for hours at a time. it was just sitting in my pocket doing absolutely nothing (I should also mention it was connected to Wi-Fi this whole time). I get back home that day with around 40ish percent left and while technically speaking that isn't bad, it's 1) pretty much the same experience I had on my year old P7P, and 2) disappointing because I've seen the battery perform much better just a few days prior. next day after that (this morning) I leave my place at 100% as usual, but this time I noticed something strange. while I was actively using the phone, the battery was draining really rapidly (literally dropping by 1 to 2% every 5 to 6 minutes), but for whatever reason it stand by time was amazing. I had times where I put my phone down for over 2 hours and I checked it and it had only dropped by 2%. not sure why it adopted this weird battery behavior. I was then sitting in an hour long class, not on my phone at all during the class, only to pull it out of my pocket and feel that it was very warm to the touch and it dropped almost 7 to 8% in the 1 hour of me doing absolutely nothing with it. as I stated earlier, I got back home with about 40ish percent tonight and again, while technically on paper that's pretty fine battery life, I've seen this phone do better just a few days ago (also the few times today when I was on my phone for an extended period of time I could see the quoted end time of my phone battery rapidly getting sooner and sooner). now I'm not one to return a phone and get a different one (unless it's rlly bad), but I was very disappointed that this is what my experience was becoming.so here's the brand new developmentsAndroid 14 has these new battery diagnostics features (which are honestly less diagnostic and more generic help desk stuff), but I clicked through a few things and it brought me to this website where it could actually run an actual battery diagnostic on my phone by entering my IMEI number. I ran the diagnostic and it actually showed me the first screenshot you see below, showing that there is actually something genuinely wrong with my battery and I'm not crazy. Fortunately, since this phone is brand spanking new, it's still under the one year warranty. so I called Google support about it and explained my issue. the guy on the phone told me that I should charge my phone up to 100% tonight and then leave it unplugged overnight to see how it drains. apparently if it drains by more than 10% overnight idle, they means that there is definitely something wrong with the battery and they'll just replace my phone. I'm supposed to send a screenshot tomorrow morning of how the battery drains overnight. I told the guy over the phone about how my standby time today, for the most part anyways, was rather good, and that the overnight test might not reflect the actual problem with my battery and he said that I should note that for when I call them back tomorrow. I'm currently charging my phone up to let it drain overnight, and I'll update you all if there are any new developments at all. weirdly excited, as this is the closest I've come to hopefully actually fixing the problem once and for all (and not just resetting the phone all the time)TL;DR: phone battery low-key getting worse, but hopefully it's a device defect that will be remedied soon.also, here's the link to the website to run the diagnostic on your phone: https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/workflow\/10832731?hl=en-US?dark&sjid=921222039320053583-NA&dark=1&js_request_id=1698379403970_8922583220685637701&ec=https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone?p%3Ddiagnostics_phone_is_warm_health_unknown&send_feedback=1&has_promoted_product_link_click_callback=1&api_client=ghandroid&ff=1&full_page=1&pli=1let me know what you guys get! I rlly hope this helps y'all out!","329":"I upgraded from my Samsung A71 to a Pixel 8 (regular) just after new year's. The Samsung was mostly okay but had a cracked screen and occasionally glitched (and the mic \/ voice assistant was very barely useful). I figured the Pixel 8 would be a step up in at least a few areas, especially since I'm a heavy google user.It's not. It's basically just as good as that old basic A71... ?!?! That said, this phone is costing me only $5 \/ month for 24 months and that includes an upgrade from 12 to 70 GB of data (and from LTE to 5G). So basically it's costing me $0.**Overall verdict: 6\/ 10** if it weren't too much a PITA, I'd return it to Koodo (Canada), and use my Galaxy A71 for another 6\u201312 months until something worth while came out. I'll be shocked if I can get 7 years out of this but I'm optimistic, if current performance holds (with the occasional reformat), it just might. **Maybe try a 7 Pro?** Or just don't get a Google, hard to say.*Disclaimer: I'm sure there is a LOT I could be doing to set this phone up better and make better use of features. I did a fairly clean install, only transferring contacts + messages + offline music from my old phone but manually installed all apps, G-accounts, settings, WhatsApp back-up, etc. I super welcome feedback that tells me I'm \"doing it wrong\" and how I can make this work better for me.***REVIEW BY CATEGORY***I'm a light user. Tons of google suite, messaging apps, calendar, drive, mail, whatsapp (constantly all day), socials, and various 3rd party apps for devices like Starlink, Galaxy Buds, etc. Basically nothing intensive. Lots of voice text, voice memos, and using Assistant to set reminders, call places, look up info, etc.***Battery:** This was good at first. On basic use I almost got through THREE days. It was around 5% at 4 or 5pm on work day 3. Text and browsing almost exclusively. Then on a travel day, 1 hr of 5G in the car (30min Zoom w\/ Video + 30min soundcloud music, via car bluetooth), plus 1.5 hrs of offline music to bluetooth earbuds, and I was down to 50%... wtf?! So 2 hrs of Zoom or 4\u20135 hrs of music streaming and this thing is dead. That's no bueno. 5\/ 10**Screen \/ size**: I do like the size shift from my gigantic A71. It fits in my pockets, all of them. It's a little thicker which is ... whatever... it's just too small to watch a show on, but frankly that's probably a good thing. Yes it seems clearer & crisper, and probably brighter, but does that actually improve my use? Not so far. 8\/10**Voice assistant:** I was really expecting Google assistant on a google phone to be great, or at least good. It is mediocre. Asking it to text\/message something is glitchy, and if it's more than a short sentence then forget about it. Asking is to call a business is pretty useless. Painfully accurate annunciation is required. Honestly the mic + Google assistant on my Bose smart speaker (5 yrs old) is way way way better and understand normal speech from across the room. blargh. 2\/ 10**Features:** I'm sure I have LOTS to discover, and I generally appreciate them. Haptic feedback, always on display, customized do not disturb \/ sleep schedule, etc. etc. etc. I don't \/ won't use most of this, but it seems solid and versatile. Lift and tap to unlock is great, double tap on the back is neat future. 9\/ 10**Connectivity**: this seems better than my samsung. Despite warnings about the modem I am, generally, connected more often and with a stronger signal (both WiFi + cell \/ data). i live rurally in the mountains so this is big. 10\/10.**Camera:** very disappointed. Not intuitive, not excellent photos. Just as mediocre as my Samsung *unless* I really put in effort to get the right setting, which I have to do manually. THere isn't even an auto-flash based on low-light that I can turn on. Night mode seems decent, I think. And macro is pretty solid. Photos are stunning done right, and a PITA to get right. 7 \/ 10 hardware, 3 \/ 10 software.**Performance**: Boot-up \/ reboot is OK, but still kinda slow for what it has to load and how much RAM \/ CPU power is in there (As much as my laptop but takes quite a lot longer to load). Once on, it's pretty fast to load and navigate but already 2\u20133 weeks in it'll lag here or there in random places. I never have more than a dozen apps open or a dozen chrome tabs, so that's a big red flag. 7 \/ 10.","330":"I was happy to get a new phone, since my beloved HTC One M9 started to be unusable. A 2015 flagship with custom ROM AICP, featuring Android 10. It was on constant throttling due to its constant 65\u00b0C on the CPU.Google in Italy put the Pixel 3a at 300\u20ac instead of 400\u20ac for a couple of days and I rushed to buy it, I couldn't believe it, the mighty Pixel 3a! 300\u20ac! A bargain.First 2 days everything was awesome, new phone, new life.But:-I noticed the screen was kinda yellowish: the HTC had pure whites even after 4 years of use, while the Pixel coudn't. I went through display settings but still, no whites;-The audio quality on the jack was the major let down, for me: if the jack is in but no audio of any sort is played, it hums. Hums a lot, depending on the speaker I use. The point is: my HTC didn't hum no matter where I used it and at what volume. Also, on good quality speakers (the highest audio optionals in my Volvo) I found it difficul to distinguish instruments in songs I know very well. On my HTC I had a kind of audio quality that made me enjoy listening to music. On the Pixel, however, I had to turn the audio off;-Android on Pixel is really smooth, but switching from app to app resulted in their continuos refreshes;-The squeeze gesture is not customisable. WTF, seriously? Why don't Google gives us the chance to customize our Android from its native settings? It's not hard, it's not iOS. We're already forced to have that ugly Google bar at the bottom of the screen. Having the squeeze also on Google assistant is just unecessary ihmo;-The camera: 12MP aren't enough for me; the Pixel 3a has a great camera, I know that. But it's okay only if you don't zoom or crop. Also, I took several pictures of the same subject (I have a background as a pro sport photographer, so I'm used to take like 10 pictures for the same scene) and basically they all have different temperature and tint (greenish tint, the worst one, actually). Same subject, same light, but somehow it manages to read random light values. Also, it stutters while recording videos. On basically every video I had a lag that cut to a bunch of frames afterwards. Not pleased. My HTC had a 21MP untamable camera, no stabilization, hard as hell to use, but gave quality shot. 12MP on Pixel I'm able to see that's all software, working on that camera, not much more. Want to shoot RAW on the Pixel? No problem, but you get its shitty HDR+ function automatically that kills all of the shadows. What if I wanted a RAW to edit with my style? Like high contrast B\/W? Nah.-It's bigger: I know it's a mid-tier smartphone but come on, its bezels are bigger than all of the Chinese low-end smartphones. Even those phones have extra slim bezels.In conclusion, I had a shitton more of custom and peculiar things on my older phone, than on the Pixel, and I can't understand why there's so much love for that device. Google promises 3 years of updated. On their own devices. They make that phone and try to emulate Apple and then only give to their devices 3 years of updates.I'm disappointed, I probably expected more from a Google device, I had the Samsung Galaxy Nexus back then which I loved, I probably lived on that dream with the Pixel 3a.So, what are your thoughts? Did I get a faulty unit? How are you doing with your Pixel 3a?","331":"I'm not sure that I love it.  I want to love it, but there's just so many tiny things that have been irking me to the point of possibly returning it under buyers remorse.  Hoping some may shed some light on my issues and if there's hope of them being resolved. For context I was using a IPhone 11 last, but has generally been an android user. 1. The absolutely horrid GPS tracking\/accuracy.  I use Quickbooks to track my mileage for work, and doing the same drives everyday I'm noticing wildly different and inconsistent reporting. I tried turning my location on and off as well as resetting the phone. And it seemed to improve a bit, but still some weird inconsistencies as compared to previous phone.  And even while just using Google maps I've seen it get caught up and show an inaccurate location, one of which caused me to take a wrong turn.2. Bluetooth - on 3 different devices it has cut out randomly on me, my car, my ear buds, and my Bluetooth speaker. I've tried restarting phone as well as forgetting all devices and re-pairing them, but that was most recent so haven't really had a chance to test cut outs.3. The Face unlock is absolutely horrid as well. Especially in low light conditions, but even in some instances with decent lighting, I've noticed that I have to hold the phone at an exact angle for it to register, a thing I never new as an issue with iPhone. And then Low light is an absolute write off. Edit; yes I do mostly use fingerprint unlock, but still a valid concern. 4. There's been an annoyingly noticeable amount of times where the screen just turns off while I'm reading something or watching a reel on Instagram. Even with the auto stay on, in decent enough light the screen just goes black.  Feel like this is connected to the previous issue.I'm hoping theres explanations and solutions to these. Cuz on their own it's minor, but accumulated it's just becoming annoying tiny inconveniencing grievances that are causing me to think this is the best of Google? And wanting to possibly exchange the phone for something else.Please tell me it's a case of PICNIC. ","332":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","333":"I have encountered an unique issue with my phone (Google Pixel 7).When the phone connects to my car stereo it connects for only phonecalls but doesn't play music.If I keep the car running and reconnect the phone to the stereo system, it connects just for music, but then I can't receive calls on it. It works fine with my friends iPhone though.I have tried resetting my cars stereo system, resetting the Bluetooth and WiFi settings on my phone, restating my phone. Nothing has fixed this issue.Please let me know if someone has a fix for this. TIA","334":"1. We pay 1100 US Dolar for a higher tier mid ranger. Here is the top reasons why.2. SoC is complete garbage Sh\\*Tynos.3. They do not have 8k video and 960FPS. Phones had this many years ago, especially Samsung phones.4. They use crappy mid range camera sensors, and relying on computational photography.5. Anything the Pixel does and their AI, they give it away to everyone including Apple. All those Samsung AI crap is given to Samsung, and proves you do not need special hardware. For 2 years in a row Pixel 6 and 7 they did not change the crap main sensor but also it was same SoC CPU situation. Pixel 8 Pro changed this, but still using Samsung crap sensors or Sony sensors from last decade.6. Their front hole punch is almost twice as big and intrusive while A53 even has this small hole punch, which they use on their Ultra phone. I low ender has a much less sized and non intrusive.7. The GPU in the Sh\\*Tynos is garbage compared to pretty much every Android flagship.8. The connectivity and modem they use is still garbage.9. They are using the exact same technology for FP in which you use it from AOD you have to press and hold and you get back in with a laggy effect, While other flagships you just tap it and your in clean. No slowmo effects we did not ask for.10. They do not use Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision, while 600 dollar and 700 phones have this.11. The audio from the phone is great, but it is not at the same level of true flagships and you have to fuk around trying to find a app to boost the bass and so on.12. Their file system on Pixel 8 Pro did not adopt UFS 4.0 which is almost twice as fast as UFS 3.113. For video they use 4k60FPS, while Vivo flagship is 4k120FPS.14. The battery life blows as well does the efficiency, thanks to a compromised G4.15. Tensor is a gimmick. You watch the launch event and they show you great stuff, especially AI, but then they give it away to all phones. So you DO NOT need a so called in house Tensor chip to run these so called Pixel AI features which they boast and then give it to every Pixel and eventually all phones. This makes Pixel just another phone and not a so called special Google Chip, which it is not. You can do everything a Pixel does without the need for a Sh8ynos so called special Tensor crap. All gimmick.16. They are Trillions and then some company, which does not have money for the above and charges you 1100 and puts Pixel all over the place with their partnership with NBA.17. For Pixel 9 series they will use a Sh\\*Tynos 2400, instead of the 2500, because they just do not have money to do this. So fuk them Im glad their sales are sh\\*T, just like their phones which I keep coming back to.18. They show Magic Editor on the launch event as if it is something special that Tensor does and you need a Tensor to do this. WRONG! They eventually give all that sh\\*T to all phones. True flagships are faster with all the Pixel features and AI features.19. Now everyone say I diss or Im angry, while Im not. Just stating facts.20. Pixel or people telling me go buy another phone etc etc. I do not want that. I like Pixel phones, but do not lie about flagship, when its not. I will get the Pixel 9 Pro, because I get the new Pixel every year since last decade and so on. It is what it is. Xaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo which both use 1-inch type sensor to lower or same priced phones. This year the Pixel 9 Pro XL might just cost 1200 with 256GB.21. We also do not care about your 16GB of ram. Useless. Also to end they use a lower end bluetooth situation. Also no Gorilla Armor on P8P, while other phones priced lower give you this. Thank you and God Bless.","335":"1. Take time to explore and customize your settings. The default options aren\u2019t perfect\u2014you\u2019ll need to tweak things, but once you do, this phone becomes the most personalized device you\u2019ve ever used.2. RCS with iOS 18 has finally bridged the messaging gap between iPhones and Android. No more SMS headaches\u2014if my texts send as SMS, I just remind my friends to update their phones. Photos send in much higher quality, and typing status and read receipts are awesome additions.3. Use KDE Connect [https:\/\/kdeconnect.kde.org\/](https:\/\/kdeconnect.kde.org\/) to sync your clipboard between your Mac and Pixel. You can wirelessly browse your phone\u2019s files from your Mac and share items like AirDrop.4. Battery life took about a week to settle. It was good but not great at first\u2014now, it\u2019s excellent. You really notice the difference once it optimizes to your usage.5. Gemini is miles ahead of Siri and keeps getting better. Gemini Live (full voice control) is amazing while driving. Don\u2019t forget to activate your free year of Gemini Advanced\u2014it\u2019s like having ChatGPT that can also control your phone, home automation, and everything around you.6. I was surprised at how many of my existing smart home products support Google Home. Almost 1\/2 of my devices weren\u2019t compatible with Apple, now most are.7. Get the 256GB version if you can. I got the 128GB because the 256GB had a longer wait time, but it\u2019s filling up fast. The extra space is worth it.8. Android Auto has grown on me, and I now prefer it to CarPlay because it\u2019s more customizable. The main menu can still be a bit laggy, but it's smooth everywhere else. Features like pinch-to-zoom on maps, support for notifications from lot more apps, and a more customizable interface make it feel more advanced.9. Apple Music works great in the Android ecosystem, and I\u2019m keeping it. Lossless audio sounds fantastic, especially since Android supports high-res Bluetooth codecs that iPhones don\u2019t. It\u2019s a great experience overall.10. USB-C is pretty much everywhere now, especially since iPhones have adopted it too. It\u2019s awesome having just one cable for everything\u2014your phone, laptop, and more, especially when you\u2019re traveling.11. The latest generation of Android Wear watches is excellent. Don\u2019t bother with last-gen models; the improvements in performance, and battery life make a huge difference. No more lagfest on my Galaxy Watch 7.12. Photos on Pixel usually looks better, with vibrant colors that pop, although iPhones sometimes capture more realistic colors and better dynamic range. Videos, especially when switching between lenses, aren\u2019t as smooth as iPhones but still hold up well.13. Video editing is bad on the Pixel 9 Pro, and I assume it's similar with other Android phones. I tried a bunch of apps, just use your computer.14. Most apps are now on par with or better than iOS. Apps like Robinhood, Kia Access, and ClickUp work even better on Android, though some, like X (Twitter), still lag behind.15. I switched back to Android after years with iOS (iPhone 14 Pro -> Pixel 9 Pro XL). I was an early Android fan from the MyTouch 3G days and even used to be active as a developer in the modding scene. I left because of the jankiness and unreliability, but things have changed. Google is marching ahead with AI while Apple\u2019s dropped the ball. The \u201cit just works\u201d vibe is finally here on Android, and universal standards like USB-C, RCS, and broader compatibility are making everything click. This feels like a major turning point in the ecosystem wars.","336":"I am just wondering if anyone has the same problem with me with any of their Pixel phones constantly forcing a connection with their earbuds. I tried to disconnect my AirPods from my Pixel 8 Pro to connect to my iPhone and the Pixel refuses to stay disconnected to the AirPods. I brought the phone over to the Google Experience Visitor Center in Mountain View and they told me this is the first time they ever heard of a problem like that, so I'm wondering if anyone actually has experienced the same thing as me. I have multiple different types of earbuds as you can see in the video I posted and it does that with every single earbud or Bluetooth device. The crazy thing is dish forceful connection doesn't happen all the time, but when it does happen I am forced to completely turn off my pixel 8 pro just so I can stay connected with my earbuds on other devices, cuz the moment the pixel turns back on it will force connection on whatever earbuds I am using at the time. As you can see in the video I have posted the moment I press disconnect and try to connect the airpods to my iPhone. It would almost immediately reconnect onto the airpods all by itself without me pressing anything.","337":"I'm having an odd issue with my 9PXL when connected to my cars Bluetooth (not android auto). It connects to my car fine and works perfect as long as I have something playing but as soon as I pause the music the phone will randomly disconnect after about 10 or so secs and then reconnect which automatically resumes playback which can be annoying. Bluetooth connection with my pixel watch and pixel buds seem fine and do not disconnect. I've tried stock android 14 with the latest updates and I've tried android 15 qpr 1 beta 2 since it has a lot of Bluetooth fixes in the patch notes but the issue persists. Any idea what could be going on? ","338":"Hello everyone, I got fed up with this phone and Google,I tried buying the Pixel 8 pro in October 23, but I think it will be my last Pixel. I wanted to share here so that anyone can know about those general issues.In a few words plenty of problems that make me feel the phone isn't reliable(i bought it from an officiel provider in Switzerland)Here is the list of all my issues :Screen jitters when you move your finger slowly. In others words the screen is not precise. I tried addressing to Google, they locked my post in the communities. I met another Pixel 8 Pro owner and he had the same issueProblem with Android auto, when it lasts too long the system disconnects (no problem with the p30 pro), same when I change cableNot being able to customise the desktop, in particular not being able to put a page on the left for example.The button to switch sound on and off is so unconveniently placed, when i have always seen a simple toggle button in the notif bar so far...Lack of power compared to the competition (but this one I knew before hand to be honnest). This is particularly noticeable in gamesGoogle's lie about zoom enhance. What else have they lied about or will they lie about?The intelligent message feature described in the tips isn't even available on my phoneThe shortcut for answering machine messages (the same they have on iphones) was put in and then removedPoor reception. Sometimes it shows 5G, and I'm not moving, the connection is still weak or non-existent. If the internet doesn't work, it shouldn't say it's got 5G - it doesn't make sense.File copying disconnects if too many files are copied, but no problem with older phonesOftentimes it doesn't charge simply by plugging it into any ports, e.g. on battery or in the carNo way of extracting slow-motion videos with the chosen configuration, you can only extract the video completely slowed down.Bye guys","339":"My wife has a Pixel 8 and a Versa 2 watch. My son has a Pixel 8 and Versa 4 watch. While debugging an issue with my wife's phone pairing with her car I noticed that her watch does not show up under Bluetooth->Connected devices. It shows as \"Saved\" and not \"Connected\". In the Fitbit app there are no errors and it syncs regularly. I unpaired and re-paired the watch and it then showed up under Connected devices. The next morning it was gone (back to \"Saved\") and it won't stay as \"Connected\".My son came over and we compared his settings. He had the same situation. So he unpaired and re-paired. It then showed up under Connected devices. As we were looking at the Bluetooth devices on his phone, the watch went from Connected to Saved which I assume means not connected. We tried to click it and connect manually but it would not. It still shows up in the Fitbit app normally and is syncing.Is this normal behavior?","340":"Hey everyone!I am looking for a replacement for my trusty old Huawei P30 Pro, I read tons of reviews, went through dozens of sample galleries, watched way too many YouTube videos and finally decided that there are only 2 models on the market right now I can imagine settling with, namely:Google Pixel 8 ProHonor Magic 5 ProI know I am in the Pixel subreddit, but please hear me out before directly jumoing to a conclusion.After reading many reviews, many claim that the Pixel 8 Pro has one of the best cameras on any smartphone. The thing is, I have VERY specific demands, and so far I am not sure whether or not these phones actually meet my requirements, or to be more precise, which of these would compromise my experience the least.To make it clear, I will provide a list of what I am looking for in a smartphone, sorted by priority (top = highest priority), especially in photography and taking high resolution images.1. High resolution images which are sharp WITHOUT aggressive sharpening\/filtering\/post processing, straight from the sensor of ALL lenses except the front camera (RAW files!)2. RAW files which allow for quite a bit of editing, say the dynamic range should be wide enough to correct shadows and highlights3. Full manual control over the photos via camera2api (white balance, shutter speed, ISO, RAW\/JPG etc.)4. Full manual control over the videos via camera2api (white balance, shutter speed, framerate, ISO, LOG profile color, high bitrate mode, image stabilisation active\/deactivated etc.)5. Very good battery life6. Google Pay needs to work flawlessly7. Android Auto should work flawlessly with an AA Wireless Dongle (P30 Pro only connects correctly if the Display is unlocked while unlocking the car, if the P30 Pro was in Standby, usually Google Maps doesn't work\/screen of Android Auto stays black, I hate that)8. Face unlock should work great, along with Fingerprint scanning9. Double tap to wake10. Screen projection should work in 16:9 so it completely fills the entire TV (don't care if it's wireless or by cable)11. An always on display with notification icons&#x200B;What is of absolutely NO interest to me (not just of little interest, I mean literally no interest at all\/don't care):1. AI editing of photos\/videos like that magic eraser\/magic mic stuff on the Pixel, this stuff is annoying and of such low quality that I will not use any of this, I am using Photoshop professionally since Photoshop 5 (not CS5, I literally mean version 5 from 1997). Again least interest in these quality-ruining features, the quality should come from the hardware, not \"fixing in post\"2. Front camera (I would be happy with a 20yo VGA front facing camera, I don't take photos with it at all obviously)3. Gaming\/Performance of the processor (I just need performance for 4k video, snappy photo taking, anything else processor-related is of no interest to me)4. Display&#x200B;So with these things out of the way, I am not sure which phone to get to be honest.In Germany, right now I could get the 512 GB versions for \\~1200 \u20ac (Google) or 800 \u20ac (Honor) respectively. What I don't know (because I obviously don't own any of these phones) is whether or not they actually support the first 4 points of my priority list. I heard that on Google Pixel 7 Pro the Tele lens offers no manual controls for example in third party apps.Is there anyone out there who could confirm if the Pixel 8 Pro actually allows full manual control over video by using the ProShot app for example? ProShot would allow to, for example, set the resolution to 4k, framerate to 24, shutter speed to 1\/48s (I use an ND filter to compensate a too bright image), bitrate to 80+MBps and be able to lock the white balance\/focus etc.? Would this be possible on ALL lenses on the Pixel 8 Pro?Same question for the Honor Magic5 Pro. Coming from the Huawei P30 Pro I have the problem that the Kirin SoC and Huawei's EMUI never gave proper access to the cameras using camera2api, meaning you can't set many things manually like white balance on the ProShot app (only on the native app), taking RAW files is not possible either. For video it's even worse, in 4k you are stuck with 30fps only on the P30 Pro, you can't go down to 24 fps for example if you wanted to. LOG curve is not available either. Since the Honor Magic5 Pro probably inherited quite a lot of EMUI's quirks (MagicOS is based off EMUI after all), I can imagine that all these features I mentioned in points 3 and 4 are not supported here either, which would be a big nono for the Honor Magic5 Pro for me.&#x200B;Having said that, the Honor Magic5 Pro's GN2 sensor (1\/1.12\") seems to be far superior (hardware-wise before the software kicks in) compared to the Pixel 8 Pro's GNV sensor (1\/1.31\"). I read many articles and I was especially disappointed in the Pixel 8 Pros straight-out-of-camera JPG photos. They are sporting a ton of artifacts, oversharpening, too much denoising killing off texture and making areas look mushy or like an oil painting, probably to make the photos look crisp on a small and bright display like the Pixel actually has instead of a monitor\/print. My question here would be: Are the 50 MP RAW files actually more usable, as in, they are not killed with all the AI post processing and still offer a decent amount of detail I could unveil using Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop? That's what I am interested in.&#x200B;Let me give you an example from GSM Arena and Chinahandys, straight out of camera 50 MP JPG images and Nightsight images:Google Pixel 8 Pro:[https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/google\\_pixel\\_8\\_pro-review-2629p5.php#image29](https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/google_pixel_8_pro-review-2629p5.php#image29)[https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless\\_pixel\\_8\\_pro\\_main\\_2.jpg](https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless_pixel_8_pro_main_2.jpg)&#x200B;Honor Magic 5 Pro:[https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/honor\\_magic5\\_pro-review-2543p5.php#image27](https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/honor_magic5_pro-review-2543p5.php#image27)[https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless\\_honor\\_magic5pro\\_main\\_3.jpg](https:\/\/www.chinahandys.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/kameravergleich-honor-magic-5-pro-vs-google-pixel-8-pro\/lossless_honor_magic5pro_main_3.jpg)&#x200B;Comparing these 2 shots, I would definitely pick the Magic5 Pro over the Pixel 8 Pro, here's the reason why:&#x200B;[Google Pixel 8 Pro vs. Honor Magic5 Pro](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ergba610lo1c1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1585ecab89fdc163874553f768c1bac434c4d887)&#x200B;These shots make me question all the results from YouTube reviewers and also from articles like DXOmark and Dpreview, because clearly the Pixel 8 Pro does have issues and is far from being best-in-class (that would be, at least in terms of photos, the top models from Huawei, but they don't have access to Google Play Services and are therefore, sadly, no option for me).&#x200B;So what I would like to know: Can any Pixel 8 Pro or Honor Magic5 Pro users confirm which camera features are accessible through the camera2api, and, which would be even better, provide some decent 50 MP photos of the respective device which they deem to be of high quality for that device? I don't care if it's straight out of camera or edited in Camera Raw from a DNG file. As long as it does represent the maximum quality of either of these smartphone cameras.&#x200B;I found two examples which do give me some hope though that the Pixel 8 Pro actually produces good quality photos at 50 MP. One of them is this one:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/3442313345](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/3442313345)  Here's the JPG version of it, straight out of camera (again, oversharpened, artificial look, loss of texture and detail all around with way too much contrast:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL\\_20231008\\_152706673.jpeg](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL_20231008_152706673.jpeg)Same shot exported from the RAW file without adjusting any settings apparently:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL\\_20231008\\_152706673\\_acr1.jpeg](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/files\/p\/articles\/3382512956\/PXL_20231008_152706673_acr1.jpeg)&#x200B;This one of the Pixel 8 Pro looks pretty okay though, straight out of camera:[https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/4553953025](https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/sample-galleries\/5228403326\/google-pixel-8-pro-sample-gallery\/4553953025)On the other hand, I don't know how the Honor Magic5 Pro would have performed for these two shots. Maybe even better.&#x200B;A few more example shots from users who know what they're doing would be gladly appreciated to make up my mind by myself. It's a toss coin for me at the moment with the lack of information out there. Maybe the confirmations about manual controls in video etc. I mentioned in my list can make me lean towards the Google Pixel 8 Pro despite being 50% more expensive, which is a lot.&#x200B;Thanks for the read, hope to get some good replies with no brand bashing!","341":"I pre-ordered the 8 Pro last year and it served me well for a year. All this while I did not consider buying the 9 Pro as it was just a minor upgrade from 8 Pro and didn't seem worth it.I'm based in Tokyo. I had some free time this week and my hands were itching. I noticed in the second hand market (Mercari, Yahoo Flea, etc) new unopened Pixel 9 Pro XL 128GB were going for as low $775 (\u00a5115,000). I spent some time monitoring and negotiating deals and got one for $675 (\u00a5100,000). The seller had just used it for 3 days, found it too big and wanted to get rid of it. He even provided me with the Google Store Bill, so I have warranty until August 2025. Japanese second hand markets are indeed known for quality and bargain prices. I then listed my 8 Pro on Facebook Marketplace and found a buyer within an hour to buy it for $600 (90,000) straight cash. (My 8 Pro is in mint condition and 256 GB version.) So net I went from 8 Pro 256 GB to 9 Pro XL 128 GB for $75. I've been using my 9 Pro XL for a day now, and ufff, I love it. It fixes all the small annoying issues I had with my 8 Pro, which otherwise was an excellent device. Straight away, I noticed these improvements that make the phone so much better:- Design! It just feels like a flagship. Much more premium. The 8 Pro looks like a toy phone next to it, especially if you have it in the Bay Blue color.- Connectivity! My 8 Pro would frequently disconnect from my home wifi and reconnect.- Battery life and charging!. My 8 Pro would often heat up and slow charge. The efficient G4 along with the better cooling system does seem to make a difference- Performance! Even though G4 is a minor upgrade from G3, the phone does feels much snappier with smooth scrolling on all apps, and the extra 4GB does Ram helps. - Front Camera! I found the face unlock to perform noticeably better. It still though doesn't work on dark  areas- 5x Zoom! It is way better on the 9 Pro XL, even though the cameras the same. - Brightness! The improvement in max brightness does help on a sunny day. Things which are the same but I wished were fixed:- You still cannot record 4k HDR at 60fps. Just the limitation of the processor- Battery still drains relatively quick when using the camera - Video is still jittery, especially if you're on 5x Zoom. Also transition between lens is still awful. ","342":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","343":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after over 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = camera quality, great design, OS (with some caveats), great screen (some caveats too) Negatives = everything else\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Gorgeous OLED panel : A truly beautiful display, high-resolution, good brightness..unfortunately plagued by mutiple lags and frame drops in the UI, I'll get back to that. Now onto the negatives. First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of. You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else","344":"So I've had my pixel 6a for about a year and just now I'm having issues staying connected with Bluetooth, the internet connection randomly turns itself off even if it's on automatic reconnection. Most of my apps won't open or just stay loading forever, no matter how many times I restart it does nothing, it's completely updated to Android 15, and I'm not too sure what to do about it. Does anyone else have this issue or is my phone dying ","345":"I've had my pixel 8 pro for at least a month now and I'll go over to the main points but the title says the main thing.Camera: The camera shoots video better than professional cameras with perfect stabilization, 4k60fps framerate stable videos, the photos are perfect because of the ai running on the TPU chip, I don't mind the little loading after taking a photo because it makes them perfect even in the most unlikely and worst conditions. The 5x optical zoom does the difference too.UI and UX: The pixel experience is perfect, no bloatware, attention to the detail, perfect UI, simple, easy to root or unlock bootloader if you're that kind of person, It all couldn't be better. Kudos to Google for that.Hardware and performance:CPU is great, GPU is not the best but can run any game at **max settings** **at at least 50fps**, this includes genshin impact and fortnite at max settings btw. The TPU allows for lightning quick ai photo perfection, recording summarization, audio s\u00e9paration in video, message remixing and more. Also 12gb ram which is perfect. Build quality: Couldn't be better the phone itself is smooth to the touch, beautiful, doesn't break easily if you don't throw it on the floor, stable on a flat surface despite the camera and moreScreen: Georgous, adaptative refresh rate means always on display consumes about 0.7% battery per day if always on. Adaptative refresh rate also triggers when content on the screen doesn't move aka when you read which makes the device last multiple days. It's also OLED of super AMOLED I forgot so the colors are perfect and accurate and beautiful.Overheating: Doesn't, heats just a little bit while heavy gaming but not that bad (not **over**heating)Fingerprint sensor: It's optical so if your screen is dirty or your finger is wet it won't work well and even sometimes when everything is right it won't work, it will tho if you set your main finger two times work perfectly every time except if wet or way too dirty.Face unlock: Everything perfect except it doesn't work in the dark if youre too far from your screen because not enough light. It also detects if your eyes are closed or if you're not looking at it in which case it wont unlock.Battery life: On TikTok lasts an average of nine hours because dynamic refresh rate can't kick in, on heavy gaming 5 for the same reason and also heavy processing, for light gaming 8 because the dynamic refresh rate cant kick in either and processing, while for reading it lasts multiple days. If you use this phone normally it will last one day or two before requiring to charge, it also has adaptative charging so if you charge at night and you setup bedtime mode it'll turn on bedtime mode disabling notification for the night and charging your phone to about 80% and then it'll charge slowly hitting 100% when your alarm rings, slow charging preserves battery. The part of this phone that consumes way too much battery is the modem which is not energy efficient (what connects to the cell tower) meaning that heavy networking will consume more battery.Software updates: 7 years of android updates and feature drops garrented. (More than iphone)Price: 900 bucks, not expensive for a device this quality.Do I recommend: If you're ready to put in the price to get a perfect phone that lasts 7 years, then yeah buy it I promise you you will never regret it. Else buy the 8 or 8a but expect worse battery life, camera and slightly worse build quality and 8gb ram instead of 12, but you'll get he same chip so same general performance except the phone will heat slightly more while gaming because of reduced size","346":"I've tried searching for fixes and enacted many different remedies saying to reset one thing or disable another and nothing really fixes anything. I'm coming off a string of Samsung S devices to try something new\/different with the fold but for all the wins of the device it's seriously lacking in some odd places. My worst and most notable 3x areThe Bluetooth is terrible, nearly useless, I have less than 1\/6 the range of my S23U with occupational tools (15m vs 90), my headphones consistently drop out and do not auto reconnect. Occasionally it will even have a hissifit at my car (under 20cm) and refuse connections until the phone is power cycled. My gps signal lock is woefully innaccurate and will wander about the map while standing still. It never reads a consistent speed on the highway and cannot be trusted to be even moderately correct. My s23u maintained consistent and accurate positioning within a couple of metres at all times and could even be used for fairly accurate race lap recordings.

This will not apply to the Pixel 9 or the pixel 9 proI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly.","349":"Bugs I Observed on Pixel 8:- Persistent Home Screen Icons for Uninstalled Apps: If an app with a home screen shortcut is uninstalled, the icon remains until the screen is locked and unlocked again.- Excessive Battery Drain: The battery drains significantly even when the phone is not in use, losing more than 30% over 6 hours of inactivity, compared to the usual 5-10% on other phones.- No Indication When Calls Are Answered: There is no vibration or sound to indicate when a call is answered, making it difficult to know without looking at the screen or hearing the receiver.- No option to check who connected to our mobile hotspot: There is no option to see who connected to our Hotspot. When I am friends some extra devices will connect. I want to check who is connected. Every phone has this.Features I Would Love in Pixel 8:- Double Tap to Turn Screen On\/Off: This would enhance user convenience.- Daily Data Usage Tracking: Currently, only monthly or app-specific data usage is available. Daily tracking would be very helpful.Features I Definitely Need in Pixel 8:- One-Tap Bluetooth\/Wi-Fi Toggle: It would be more efficient to turn Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on\/off with a single tap, rather than navigating through multiple menus.- Network Speed Indication: This feature would help monitor data consumption by apps and assess the quality of the internet connection.- Disable Automatic Wi-Fi Scanning: Wi-Fi scanning automatically turns on when I enable location services. I would like the option to disable this feature.Share you comments, maybe if enough people repost this. Google might implement atleast some of the features Upgrading phone should get more features. My Poco X3 has some quality features than pixel....Edit : When we are changing app grind in wallpaper and style preview of what we are setting is not showing","350":"1. Take time to explore and customize your settings. The default options aren\u2019t perfect\u2014you\u2019ll need to tweak things, but once you do, this phone becomes the most personalized device you\u2019ve ever used.2. RCS with iOS 18 has finally bridged the messaging gap between iPhones and Android. No more SMS headaches\u2014if my texts send as SMS, I just remind my friends to update their phones. Photos send in much higher quality, and typing status and read receipts are awesome additions.3. Use KDE Connect [https:\/\/kdeconnect.kde.org\/](https:\/\/kdeconnect.kde.org\/) to sync your clipboard between your Mac and Pixel. You can wirelessly browse your phone\u2019s files from your Mac and share items like AirDrop.4. Battery life took about a week to settle. It was good but not great at first\u2014now, it\u2019s excellent. You really notice the difference once it optimizes to your usage.5. Gemini is miles ahead of Siri and keeps getting better. Gemini Live (full voice control) is amazing while driving. Don\u2019t forget to activate your free year of Gemini Advanced\u2014it\u2019s like having ChatGPT that can also control your phone, home automation, and everything around you.6. I was surprised at how many of my existing smart home products support Google Home. Almost 1\/2 of my devices weren\u2019t compatible with Apple, now most are.7. Get the 256GB version if you can. I got the 128GB because the 256GB had a longer wait time, but it\u2019s filling up fast. The extra space is worth it.8. Android Auto has grown on me, and I now prefer it to CarPlay because it\u2019s more customizable. The main menu can still be a bit laggy, but it's smooth everywhere else. Features like pinch-to-zoom on maps, support for notifications from lot more apps, and a more customizable interface make it feel more advanced.9. Apple Music works great in the Android ecosystem, and I\u2019m keeping it. Lossless audio sounds fantastic, especially since Android supports high-res Bluetooth codecs that iPhones don\u2019t. It\u2019s a great experience overall.10. USB-C is pretty much everywhere now, especially since iPhones have adopted it too. It\u2019s awesome having just one cable for everything\u2014your phone, laptop, and more, especially when you\u2019re traveling.11. The latest generation of Android Wear watches is excellent. Don\u2019t bother with last-gen models; the improvements in performance, and battery life make a huge difference. No more lagfest on my Galaxy Watch 7.12. Photos on Pixel usually looks better, with vibrant colors that pop, although iPhones sometimes capture more realistic colors and better dynamic range. Videos, especially when switching between lenses, aren\u2019t as smooth as iPhones but still hold up well.13. Video editing is bad on the Pixel 9 Pro, and I assume it's similar with other Android phones. I tried a bunch of apps, just use your computer.14. Most apps are now on par with or better than iOS. Apps like Robinhood, Kia Access, and ClickUp work even better on Android, though some, like X (Twitter), still lag behind.15. I switched back to Android after years with iOS (iPhone 14 Pro -> Pixel 9 Pro XL). I was an early Android fan from the MyTouch 3G days and even used to be active as a developer in the modding scene. I left because of the jankiness and unreliability, but things have changed. Google is marching ahead with AI while Apple\u2019s dropped the ball. The \u201cit just works\u201d vibe is finally here on Android, and universal standards like USB-C, RCS, and broader compatibility are making everything click. This feels like a major turning point in the ecosystem wars.","351":"I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","352":"This is a long read, but giving my negative experience with Google's \"Extended Repair Program\" for the known screen issue for the Pixel 8So I just started getting the splotchy green screen, random flickering and most recently, permanent verticle purple line. Itl honestly could not use the phone as a navigation because the flickering got me so dizzy. I don't live near a Google store so I went to their partner store, uBreakiFix. They said mine was just outside my 1 year warranty (November 4th) and their system doesnt show the updated extended repair program for the Pixel 8 screen. I went home and went on Google chat, and the representative confirmed that I am covered for a screen replacement. I told them of what happened at the store, and their exact words: \"1:08:04\u202fPM Krisha: Don't worry, you won't be charged for the repair since the device is covered under warranty. Please let the store staff know that the support team has confirmed it will be free of charge.1:09:05\u202fPM Krisha: If the repair ends up being a paid service, please provide us with the receipt, and we will refund the amount to you.1:09:15\u202fPM Krisha: I hope this information is helpful to you.\"I called the store and spoke to a manager, he said he knows of this issue and to bring it in, they will be able to do it for free under warranty. I bring my phone back to the store next day, and the manager then says that they aren't able to process it as a warranty repair on their system so I will need to pay out of pocket. It was a $250 replacement, but I agree because the Google representative reassured me that if that were to happen, I would be reimbursed. I submitted my receipt to Google, and today I get an email that says my claim for reimbursement was unfortunately denied. What can I do at this point??? I love the Pixel, but if Google misleads me like that with a defective phone, I don't think I will go with Pixel ever again \ud83d\ude22","353":"\"I understand everyone's sharing their experiences, but I'd like to offer a different perspective. First, when discussing issues, it's helpful to consider whether anything could have been done to prevent them. For example, when I've broken my phone, it's usually been due to my own actions, though occasional glitches do happen.Regarding Google vs. Apple, it's important to remember that Google sells a significantly larger volume of devices, so statistically, they might have more reported issues. My personal experience with my Google Pixel 7 Pro has been overwhelmingly positive. I've had two issues, both due to my own clumsiness.  The first time, the screen suddenly turned orange. Google promptly repaired it, no questions asked.  The second time, I dropped it (without a case, unfortunately!) right after receiving it back from the first repair.  Even then, Google generously sent me a second replacement device.  Their customer service, while sometimes hard to navigate due to seemingly inexperienced staff, ultimately resolved both issues quickly and efficiently.On the other hand, I had a drastically different experience with Apple. My iPhone stopped working just two months after purchase, going into a boot loop.  It took over two years of persistent effort to get it replaced. I visited seven different Apple stores, armed with my box and documentation of all the troubleshooting steps I'd taken (though I didn't have the physical receipt on hand that day).  At one point, they even told me my phone was reported lost or stolen, despite having proof of purchase through Verizon.  Verizon later confirmed they had accidentally flagged it, and it was never on any blacklist.  Apple's behavior was frankly appalling. They treated me with suspicion, essentially accusing me of stealing my own phone, and even escorted me out of one store.  It took countless emails and phone calls, and finally connecting with the right person at Apple, to resolve the issue. While I'm grateful they eventually fixed it, the two-year ordeal was unacceptable.My point is, let's try to be constructive and work with companies like Google to address any problems.  Instead of simply criticizing, perhaps we can offer helpful feedback and solutions. All phones can experience issues, regardless of the brand.  Sometimes the problem is related to the user, and sometimes it's a manufacturing defect.  If you're consistently unhappy with a particular brand, perhaps it's time to consider switching.  Ultimately, it's about finding what works best for each individual.  And finally, a general note to all companies: customer service is crucial.  It's the face of your brand, and it needs to be better.\"","354":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","355":"I have been a pixel customer for years ever since the early Nexus days. However, I cannot get a new Pixel device after the extreme customer service failure of the last two days. I got an OTA update two days ago, and my phone's screen started to work improperly. dead touch zones until yesterday it finally completely bricked. So i called customer support and they kept giving me the run around. Each interaction it is clear the customer service agent is more concerned with ending the call as fast as possible then actually solving the issue. Until finally they hung up on me! Saying They have provided a solution to my problem and that i can  get it repaired at your expense. Yes I always knew that.  How can i get the pixel 9 knowing the same thing could happen at any time. Pixel 6 is not that old.  I really enjoyed the pixel devices as a product and wish i could continue but this makes it impossible for me. Regretfully goodbye","356":"Switching from a Google Pixel 8 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max was a decision driven by several critical factors that significantly impacted my daily use and overall satisfaction with the Pixel device.Firstly, one of the major issues I encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro was its abysmal battery life. Despite efforts to conserve power such as using low screen resolution and disabling unnecessary features, I could barely manage 3 to 4 hours of screen-on time on 4G. This severely restricted my ability to use the phone throughout the day without needing frequent recharges.Secondly, charging the Pixel 8 Pro was a frustratingly slow process, regardless of the charging method or accessories used. Even with fast chargers, the device took an unreasonably long time to replenish its battery, adding to the inconvenience caused by its poor battery longevity.Another significant drawback was the inconsistent performance of its 4G and 5G antennas. I frequently experienced dropped calls, slow data speeds, and poor signal reception in areas where other devices showed better connectivity. This unreliable network performance greatly hindered my productivity and communication while on the go.Furthermore, the photo and video editing capabilities of the Pixel 8 Pro fell short of expectations. Basic tasks such as trimming a short video clip often took an unexpectedly long time, which was frustrating when trying to quickly edit and share content. This sluggish performance impacted my workflow and creative projects negatively.In terms of overall performance, the Pixel 8 Pro lagged behind other flagship smartphones in its class. Apps frequently stuttered, and there were noticeable delays in executing commands and multitasking. This subpar performance was particularly disappointing considering the device's positioning as a premium smartphone.Lastly, the artificial intelligence (AI) features touted by the Pixel 8 Pro did not deliver as promised. While Google's AI capabilities are renowned, I found that the practical applications and user experience fell short of the seamless integration and usefulness expected from such technologies.Given these persistent issues and frustrations with the Pixel 8 Pro, I made the decision to switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone offered superior battery life, faster charging capabilities, reliable network connectivity, and smoother overall performance. Its robust ecosystem of apps and services, coupled with intuitive software features, addressed the shortcomings I experienced with the Pixel 8 Pro.In conclusion, my transition from the Pixel 8 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max was driven by a need for a more reliable and efficient smartphone experience. Despite the storage capacity difference, the iPhone's performance, battery life, and ecosystem better suited my professional and personal needs, providing a significant upgrade in usability and satisfaction compared to the Pixel.(i paid same price for the 15 pro max, just got 200 gigs less)","357":"Hey everyone, I've been thinking to get a pixel device for over a year now but I've never felt so sure about it, I like a lot the idea of having pure android basically and constant software updates for quite some time, also to finally try those cameras that everyone talks about but the decision it's a bit more complex for me, let me explain.  Last year I almost got the Pixel 8a at launch day, with the offer of a case (or a discount on one) but I couldn't complete the money for the purchase, after the months started passing by I ended up just thinking to wait for the Pixel 9a, which is now a speculated to be out in a couple months (March), I want to buy it at launch day with the offer of a case or a discount on one but I've heard that it's not recommended to get the first release of a product since are the ones most likely to have issues, how true is this for pixel devices?Before you think \"Just buy it and if there's something wrong you can return it\", I do not live in the USA or anywhere where you can easily get this devices honestly, I live in a country in Central America therefore they way I use to buy almost all my hardware it's to buy them online on the USA market, and ship things to an address that will then ship everything to my country after, therefore I try to have the lowest risk at buying anything since a return might be possible but most of the time it won't be possible for me, I've bought several things over the years in this way and luckily I haven't had issues with anything so far but I would still like to know about any experiences with buying things right at release date. Also I'm getting the 9a instead of the regular 9 because while the price deference might not be much for many, it gets to be some extra months for me, aside of that the resell market for these on my country it's not good since the phones are not that popular so, if I end up not liking that much the phone and I want to sell it, it won't be anything close to the amount that I'll pay, if anything it will be less than the half just so I can sell it.Lastly, I do need to know from anyone that uses WhatsApp on their device, does the app notifications work good for y'all? Might not sound like a relevant question but I've had WhatsApp call and messages notifications issues on my last 2 devices and it gets stressing at times, so I just want to clear that one out.Appreciate it if you read all this and any comment or opinion will be appreciated as well, thanks everyone!","358":"Pixel 4a accidently upgreaded to Andoird 13.\\-Pull down menu still works lock mode.

Does anyone know of an honest youtuber who can explain how to revert fom v13 back to v11 on Pixel 4a WHILE KEEPING ALL DATA AND SETTINGS IN INTACT?

Youtubers about technology have become unreliable and don't know who to trust anymore after searching Android 13 issues b\/c the options the youtubers show do not actually exist.","359":"Logged in on my desktop for the first time in years because my phone is useless. Very frustrated with customer service\/warranty\/hardware on my \\~4 month old Pixel 9 Pro. My third Google phone- originally had a Nexus 5, which turned into a brick after a few years and AT&T insurance promptly replaced (went with Samsung for a few years after that but never liked all the bloatware). Most recently had a Pixel 6, which suited me well for 2.5 years with minimal bugs (got hot, needed restarts, etc).   I upgraded to a Pixel 9 Pro late last year. I was torn between making the switch to iphone- I've been android for a decade- and keeping the Pixel line. Gemini integration interested me and I love the telephoto lens. Gemini is awful -now I can't even play from spotify like I used to with assistant- and after a year they want to charge me $20 a month? Fat chance.  Onto my real gripe, as always with google phones- hardware issues. Yesterday morning, I picked up my phone and the screen was blank. Weird. Restarted it, still blank. Spent a few hours troubleshooting (lots of people with similar issues). No dice. Talked to the google chat, went through all the same troubleshooting options, and took it to the repair shop they told me to go to (under warranty).   Repair shop worked on it for two hours- replaced the screen- still blank. Called me up, told me it's unrepairable and I'd need to talk to google about it. I'm on the phone with google support for about 2.5 hours after that, 80% of the time on hold. at the end of the day, the best they could do was \"we told our product support team about the issue and should hear back within 48 hours. We'll call you back to tell you next steps.\" I couldn't speak with a supervisor even though I requested it because he was \"in a meeting.\"  So basically, I spent 6+ hours yesterday jumping through all the hoops for Google to troubleshoot their garbage $1000 phone and the best they can do for me is \"wait and see\" we'll call you in the next couple of days, after the shop they told me to go to already said it's unfixable. There's absolutely no damage to the phone, it's been in a case since day one. It just died.Honestly just terrible service on their part, I'm so disappointed. An entire day's worth of running around and I have no idea when I'll have a working phone.","360":"My daughter says this a lot.  I'm so torn between these two devices.  The Pixel 9 Pro vs Galaxy S25 Ultra.  I love them both, but for different reasons.  The Pixel has a more reliable point-and-shoot camera.  The Pixel has such accurate voice-to-text that I hardly have to type anymore.  The Pixel is way easier to one-hand; this comes in extra handy when walking the dogs and going running.  The Now Playing and Call Screening features are so good that I notice when they're not there on the Galaxy.  The Pixel \\*may\\* get useful features in future Feature Drops, along with Android updates quicker.  The Pixel feels more cohesive with the google software products I use.  The Galaxy has a more complete camera system - modes like Single Take - are ones I use all the time.  The Galaxy's volume output and speakers are much better than the Pixel; the Pixel sounds quiet, often.  The Edge Panels and Stackable Widgets are things I use virtually every time I pick the phone up.  The screen is enormous and beautiful; usually if there is a YouTube video I really want to watch I'll go grab my laptop, but the Galaxy screen is immersive enough that I just watch on the phone.  I like the AOD a lot better on the Galaxy - it's more aesthetically pleasing.  The battery last longer, but also charges almost 2x faster than the Pixel.  I'm genuinely hung up on whether to return the Galaxy or sell get rid of the Pixel.","361":"The best phone that i had used, the HUAWEI NOVA 5T. Phone still have great performance, good camera by today's standard, dropped many times but never had problem, battery last more than 1 day. Unfortunately have many apps no longer support Android 10 so had to change. Got the Redmi Note 14 because of the price, and had a great experience with Redmi Note 3 many years ago. 120hz is a scam, stutters all over the place. Phone size is the biggest upset for me. Camera and video is disappointing. Gave up after 6months using and try the Pixel phone, 8 is within my budget and is it better than 8a? I don't know. But at last the same size with NOVA 5T, feels good on my palm. Battery life is ok. Everything glides smoothly. I like the vibration haptic feedbacks, the ui. Somewhat feels the connection is a bit weaker? Is it?iphone something,i don't know what model, for size reference . I would have loved it if there are still new phones that come in this size. No buldgy camera island, Slim and thin. ","362":"Fellow brethren, This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel, without sacrificing any features in the previous guides I've seen here.(Switching back to 60hz, uninstalling social media apps etc).So I've had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now. The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT, which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in (6hrs). Now as the days passed, I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery. I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta, so I switched over. Now the SOT became 6.5hrs. Not good enough. Then I took the steps below, and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly. It's also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc. I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi. Also bear in mind that I'm on A15 beta. The phone is flawless for me.1. Use a really good battery monitor. Pixel inline battery monitor is okay, but it's not great. BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors. But sadly it doesn't work on android 15 :( . So I used two: Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor. Both are really good. But Gsam has more data recording and visualization (graphs for heat, battery, CPU usage and a lot more). Also accubattery doesn't record how much battery the phone signal, WiFi, CPU, android system, Kernel etc use. While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone. You can get the premium versions from Mobilism (listed in the wiki of r\/piracy) which I think gives you some extra features. You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb.2. Install macrodroid and get the \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro from the macro repository inside the app. If you understand, feel free to move on to the next one, but  If you find the above sentence dense, here's a breakdown:Macrodroid is an app which executes macros(scripts) that you install on the phone. For example, you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone, or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etc.Now, there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itself(in the bottom panel and then search for it), and the one that you want to install is called \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro. This enables battery saver when the phone is locked. Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker. Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone! You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable android.permissions.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS via adb. (Don't worry, it'll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out.) Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally.3. Using savetuner. This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications. You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app. I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit (screenshot attached) to get real time updates from apps, but also put them into deep sleep otherwise. Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when it's locked! The phone also doesn't kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu! 4. Use 4G. I know this might be a deal breaker for some people, but for me it works great. I get the speeds I want from it, the phone doesn't heat up and stays cool. I also haven't had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc. Also, my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times, connected with my watch.5. (Optional) Using A15 beta. Things are much much smoother. The animations, the performance of the phone etc. If you do update, clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it. This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats. For some reason, this helps the battery life. I also have now playing, Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on.6. Debloat your Pixel phone. Yes, you heard me right. Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat, but it isn't. There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the background.There is an amazing FOSS app called 'Canta' which helps your debloat your phone. It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat. They have been tested such that, if you remove it nothing breaks. It has a description of what the app does if you click on it, so you can decide if you want to remove it. I've attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you don't lose any features. If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want, don't worry. You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app! (I don't use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc, so you don't find them in the save list. You can decide for yourself with the descriptions)7. Use the 20 - 80 rule. I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life. I use battery to check the current battery health (even though I doubt the accuracy). My last phone (Realme), I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule.8. Using Icebox and disabling background usage. Icebox is an app which disables any app that you select, when you lock your phone. My biggest standby drainers were Instagram,Snapchat and Mull ( a hardened version of Firefox). Mull has been fixed now so I've added Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox. Now this will freeze the app (like you disabled it), so you won't be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone. No worries, you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen! I've also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp, but this will result in you losing access to microphone if you minimize WhatsApp when during a call.9. Things I wish could improve: Video calling. I do a lot of WhatsApp video calls and this eats battery like crazy. I wish Google would improve the optimization of battery on video calls.10. If you reached this far, here's a BONUS tip! If you have rooted your phone, the Sultan Kernel for pixel 8 is an amazing option for battery and performance. I've heard reports of less heat, battery consumption and snappier performance. He's doing what Google Devs should do and for the benefit of the community. So check it out! Thanks for listening! I hope people can benefit from what I did so that you can enjoy your Pixel device. Let me know if you have any questions!","363":"Switching from a Google Pixel 8 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max was a decision driven by several critical factors that significantly impacted my daily use and overall satisfaction with the Pixel device.Firstly, one of the major issues I encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro was its abysmal battery life. Despite efforts to conserve power such as using low screen resolution and disabling unnecessary features, I could barely manage 3 to 4 hours of screen-on time on 4G. This severely restricted my ability to use the phone throughout the day without needing frequent recharges.Secondly, charging the Pixel 8 Pro was a frustratingly slow process, regardless of the charging method or accessories used. Even with fast chargers, the device took an unreasonably long time to replenish its battery, adding to the inconvenience caused by its poor battery longevity.Another significant drawback was the inconsistent performance of its 4G and 5G antennas. I frequently experienced dropped calls, slow data speeds, and poor signal reception in areas where other devices showed better connectivity. This unreliable network performance greatly hindered my productivity and communication while on the go.Furthermore, the photo and video editing capabilities of the Pixel 8 Pro fell short of expectations. Basic tasks such as trimming a short video clip often took an unexpectedly long time, which was frustrating when trying to quickly edit and share content. This sluggish performance impacted my workflow and creative projects negatively.In terms of overall performance, the Pixel 8 Pro lagged behind other flagship smartphones in its class. Apps frequently stuttered, and there were noticeable delays in executing commands and multitasking. This subpar performance was particularly disappointing considering the device's positioning as a premium smartphone.Lastly, the artificial intelligence (AI) features touted by the Pixel 8 Pro did not deliver as promised. While Google's AI capabilities are renowned, I found that the practical applications and user experience fell short of the seamless integration and usefulness expected from such technologies.Given these persistent issues and frustrations with the Pixel 8 Pro, I made the decision to switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone offered superior battery life, faster charging capabilities, reliable network connectivity, and smoother overall performance. Its robust ecosystem of apps and services, coupled with intuitive software features, addressed the shortcomings I experienced with the Pixel 8 Pro.In conclusion, my transition from the Pixel 8 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max was driven by a need for a more reliable and efficient smartphone experience. Despite the storage capacity difference, the iPhone's performance, battery life, and ecosystem better suited my professional and personal needs, providing a significant upgrade in usability and satisfaction compared to the Pixel.(i paid same price for the 15 pro max, just got 200 gigs less)","364":"Hello everyone,  I'm looking for a new smartphone and can't decide whether I should stick with Android or switch to iOS. My requirements are low, but I find a few features very pleasant and would like to find them in my new smartphone.**Current situation \/ previous history**  After the first \"smartphone\" with Windows Mobile 6, I went straight to Android with various manufacturers with physical keyboard, 3D display and other features until I got my current Realme with 12 GB \/ 256 GB. Even if it is well equipped in terms of hardware, the last update was unfortunately at the end of 2021, a CustomROM is not an alternative due to banking and other apps needed daily (nothing to discuss).**What I would like to see**  Since the hardware of all smartphone classes has been sufficient for everyday-apps for years, I am more interested in the software updates, which should be up to date for many years. I also like features like 'MagSafe' and 'AirTags', which is why I'm inclined to turn my back on Android.

As there are only two effective systems worldwide, the only \u201cgood\u201d ones left are Apple and Google (no discussion, please).Thanks to all of you in advance.","365":"Hey guys,Over the past years, I've had the privilege to own every Google Pixel phone. So, I was very excited to learn about the Pixel 5 today. After watching the announcement, doing some research, and reflecting on my experience with my Pixel 4 XL, I'd like to share some thoughts. I'm not commenting on the software as every feature announced today will be coming to older generations (I think).[**I also made a video on the Pixel 5**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3o3u-Hpj6Xo) **(no ads or monetization).**# What's new in the Pixel 5\\- Google increased the RAM to 8GB in the Pixel 5. It's not going to feel like a big change if you're coming from a Pixel 4. I've been using my Pixel since it came out and I never really had any memory related issues. But, if you're coming from a Pixel 3 or older, this is going to be a leap. When the Pixel 3 came out, the RAM was already not enough. So, performance wise, you're going to feel a nice jump IF you're coming from a device older than the Pixel 4.\\- Battery life was very bad on the Pixel 4 and mediocre at best on the Pixel 4XL. So, the change to a 4,000mah battery is likely going to be much better. The processor is also less power hungry, so I'm expecting the phone to last much longer than the 4XL.\\- The front of the phone looks beautiful. I am a sucker for symmetry and I really like that Google made the effort to have a fully symmetrical bezel design. I can live the hole punch camera. Much better than the big bezel on the Pixel 4\/XL and the bathtub notch of the Pixel 3 XL\\- Google finally decided to include a wide angle camera this year! I don't know what they were smoking last year. I think a big reason why the Pixel 4\/XL wasn't successful was the lack of wide angle especially as the iPhone popularized it. I'm very excited to see how HDR+ works with the wide angle camera and this is something I can't wait to test out. Also, it seems that Night Sight will be coming to the wide angle lens as well, which should give it an edge over the iPhones\\- The return of the fingerprint sensor made me so happy! Since covid, it's been a pain in the ass to enter the passcode every time I want to unlock my phone with a mask on. So, I think the decision to move to the fingerprint reader is a good one. It also helps reduce the bezels.\\- I was pleasantly surprised to find out about the Aluminum back. I don't like putting a case on my phone and I prefer the cold feeling of a metal back over glass. While the screen can still shatter, the metal back at least reduces half of my worries when it comes to potentially dropping my phone. Also, Pixel 5 seems to be the first phone with a metal casing to have wireless charging, which is pretty sweet.\\- 5G connectivity. I personally don't care much for it, but it's good for future proofing the device.# What's no longer in Pixel 5\\- Due to the inclusion of the fingerprint reader, secure face unlock won't be on the Pixel 5. I'm okay with it because I don't know how long the mask life will go on for.\\- Motion Sense - This was a gimmick in my opinion and it was a big reason why we had a big forehead on the 4. During my time with the Pixel 4XL, I've only used it a couple times with 50% success.\\- Active Edge (Squeeze for Google Assistant) - This one bummed me out. I love the squeeze edge feature and I use it quite a bit. Much better than saying \"okay Google\" or swiping from a corner to use the assistant.\\- No more Pixel Neural Core - I had my pitchfork ready when I learned about it, but upon further research it seems that the processor has the neural core functionality baked in.\\- No zoom lens this time - Although I rarely used the zoom lens, it was still nice to have while framing some shots. I'd prefer having all 3 lenses, but if I were to sacrifice one, the zoom lens would be the one to go.\\- No more flexibility in screen sizes. While, I'm perfectly happy with a 6 inch phone (I prefer being able to use a phone one-handed), it would be nice to see some choice when it comes to screen sizes.# What hasn't changedThe phone is still waterproof, lacks a headphone jack, and will be the first one to receive updates just like any other new Pixel phone.# Overall ThoughtsIf you already have a Pixel 4\/XL, I don't recommend \"upgrading\" to the Pixel 5. In some cases, it's not even an upgrade. The processor has comparable performance to last year's model and if you prefer glass backs, then this phone already isn't for you. And face unlock is arguably better than fingerprint when you're not covering your face.But, if you have an older phone (Pixel 3 or older), this upgrade is really worth it in my opinion. The phone is priced for how much you'd get a used Pixel 4XL for and the better battery and wide angle lens are big additions. Plus, older pixels had 4GB of RAM, which isn't enough these days. You'll really notice the difference when you go from 4GB to 8GB of RAM..Edit: thank you for the gold! Please subscribe to the YouTube channel if this was helpful. I'll really appreciate it. :)","366":"Hi, I decided to share my early review with you in case you're still not sure if you want to buy a Pixel or not.To start, I've been switching phones often, but for the past four years I was stuck with iPhone (I decided to drop it because of the ecosystem - I have a watch, iPad, Mac, etc., but upgrading anything means I have to choose Apple products only, which I started to hate recently).My previous Android phone was a OnePlus (7 Pro the last one). I decided to switch to Pixel because I had an old Nexus and I was a very happy owner.Back to business, I love the system on Android, I feel it's far better than iOS. Some game changers for me are: - Being able to archive emails from the notification level. - Being able to reply on the notification level. - Navigation! I can move back by swiping from any side of the screen.I love the new Pixel's build quality, they're beautiful pieces of tech!You might be asking, \"Hey, you like it so much, what happened?\" Let me explain further.I played with it for a couple of days and I'm on holiday where I can extensively test the camera. I took my old iPhone with me.I did some recordings and videos seem to be quite far away from iPhone's quality. They're not even close, it feels like videos are slowing down, frames are not on the same level. To be honest I expected it to be worse, but not to that extent.Today I decided to play with photos and compare them more. I was surprised how far apart these two devices are. It seems that Pixel lacks details and changes the colors to be unreal (skin is more red\/orange). I will share some photos with you, you can decide on your own.I started to think about this more and I realized that: - It's easier to cover the speaker on Pixel. - The main top speaker for calls on high volume increases high tones so much that it hurts my ears. - Every time I take a photo I need to wait for a while for processing to be finished. - Sending multiple photos via WhatsApp hangs the app for a moment, there is no feedback if it's sending photos or not.I'm not even going to start about how Google treats buyers in Poland...I hope you find this helpful. In case of any questions let me know. I plan to test it for a couple more days until I get back home. After that I plan to return this device.I really wanted this phone so much.(By the way, apologies for any grammar issues, English is not my native language).","367":"[Pixel 5 5G, bought from Shopee \\(Malaysia\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6rgvso0jprfd1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e43937cb7135ba1a83006e64147978211fcc0024)Two months ago, I purchased a Pixel 5 as a second phone to pair together with my Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G (daily driver) and I'm impress how this small phone is so good.\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Details of the phone below:Date of purchased: 29th of May 2024Where I bought: [https:\/\/shopee.com.my\/sgconceptstore?entryPoint=OrderDetail](https:\/\/shopee.com.my\/sgconceptstore?entryPoint=OrderDetail)Current estimated battery health: 70% (AccuBattery App)Processor: Snapdragon 765G 5G (https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/google\\_pixel\\_5-10386.php)*I'll be writing this based on using it in Malaysia since it is not officially sold by Google here.

As for battery, it is not the best as it usually needs a charge or two per day but it doesn't bother me since I always have a powerbank with me at all times. I might change the battery in the near future if I found any shop or learn to replace it.**Telco Communications*** As for telco, the only local telco that works reliably is Celcom. I tried to put in Digi and Maxis but face some complications along the way. It was expected since this phone is not officially released for Malaysian Market (which is sad). So, to my fellow Malaysians, if you ever want to purchase a Pixel as a daily or second phone, do be aware of the risks.**Software*** Smooth as butter and even better than my Redmi. Pixel 5 also runs the latest Android 14 but I'm aware that Google will no longer have software updates in the future for this device.**Size*** Most companies now are making 6.4++ inch sized phones and somehow this compact 6.0 inch Pixel 5 fits comfortably in my hand. It's so light that I enjoy answering my chats with my Pixel 5 compared to my Redmi.**Conclusion**I love the Pixel 5 and it is sad that Google is yet to officially launch and sell it in Malaysia. I am liking how simple the UI is compared to Samsung's and Xiaomi's UI.

But, I'm someone who likes my phones snappy AF when using (and it's a big deal for me). And I feel maybe the Pixel phones are good on paper but not snappy to use. Is there anyone who recently had the 15\/14 Pro iPhones and got a Pixel 9 Pro\/XL that can explain to me how they compare in terms of responsiveness and feeling \"quick\"? I've been using iPhones all my life and currently deciding between the Pixel 9 Pro XL and upcoming 16 Pro Max. ","369":"Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been using the Pixel 8 Pro (P8P) for about half a year and the OnePlus 12 (OP12) for about a month. I thought it would be a good time to compare these two phones. As an Android Developer with 10 years of experience, I consider myself a demanding user who uses the phone for a variety of purposes including normal usage, fun, and work.To start with, I purchased the Pixel 8 Pro 12\/256 version for 1159\u20ac from the Google Store, which included the Google Pixel Watch 2 as a pre-order bonus. The OnePlus 12 (16\/512 version) was bought from TradingShenzhen for approximately 670\u20ac. Currently, the Pixel 8 Pro can be purchased for around 850\u20ac.**Let\u2019s talk about the packaging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro comes only with a USB-C cable, which in my opinion, is of really poor quality. I\u2019ve had connection issues with these cables from Google from time to time. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 comes with a 100W charger, a USB-C cable, and a classic case. Considering the package and price, the OnePlus 12 is a clear winner for me.**Moving on to the battery and charging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a 5000mAh battery while the OnePlus 12 has a 5400mAh capacity. But that\u2019s just raw data that anyone can Google. In practice, I find the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s battery to be quite disappointing. Despite numerous optimizations, I was only able to achieve around 5 hours of screen-on time (SOT) (with lower resolution, disabled 5G, location and other permissions disabled for most apps, and battery optimizations). On the other hand, achieving 7 hours of SOT on the OnePlus 12 is quite normal without any optimizations. I use both phones with lower resolution and higher refresh rate. The Pixel 8 Pro can be charged at a maximum speed of 30W, but we need a special charger for that (the same is true for the OnePlus, but they provide the charger). I tried charging the Pixel with a bunch of chargers that I have at home, and the maximum speed that I reached was 20W, which is quite poor. The combination of poor battery life and slow charging speed is really annoying. In this case, the OnePlus 12 with its 100W charging speed is the clear winner.**Let\u2019s discuss the screen.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a flat 1344x2992 6.70\" screen and the OnePlus 12 has a curved 1440x3168 6.82\" screen. Both are really great screens. The OnePlus 12 has slightly higher brightness and resolution. However, the main differences for me are that the Pixel\u2019s screen is flat and the OnePlus\u2019s is curved, and the screen color options (Google gives us 2 options and OnePlus gives us 3 options and an additional manual adjust option). The OnePlus 12 is my first phone with a curved screen and I often feel insecure about it. I\u2019ve stopped placing the phone screen down because I\u2019m worried about it. Also, when I look at the screen from a specific angle on the curved side, it looks strange (different colors). But for normal usage, it\u2019s okay, and gestures may be easier. If we are looking at specifications, the OP12 is the winner (higher brightness, higher resolution, and curved screens are more expensive), but for me, both of them are at a really high level.  **Performance \/ Heating**\u00a0  When it comes to efficiency and temperature management, the OnePlus 12, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, completely outclasses the Google Tensor 3 in the Pixel. The Pixel tends to heat up during normal usage on mobile data (LTE), and even more so during gaming, leading to a noticeable drop in performance. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 only gets slightly warm when unplugged from its 100W charger, and it\u2019s still cooler than the Pixel charging at 20W. Comparing the OnePlus 12\u2019s performance with the Pixel 8 Pro feels like comparing this year\u2019s flagship with a mid-range phone from 2020-2022. The OnePlus 12 is the clear winner here.**Connectivity**\u00a0  Connectivity might seem like an odd category, but it\u2019s quite important to me. I have the Chinese version of the OnePlus 12 (without eSIM), and I must say, I was initially worried about network coverage. However, it\u2019s noticeably better than the Google Pixel. Even when testing my Wi-Fi range, the results were shocking. I connected both phones to the same Wi-Fi network and moved to the farthest corner of my home. At this point, the OnePlus still had full range (4\/4), while the Pixel was down to half (2\/4). Running several speed tests, the OnePlus consistently achieved about 120 Mbps, while the Pixel only managed 20 Mbps - that\u2019s a five-fold difference! The OnePlus also outperforms the Pixel in terms of mobile data coverage.**Camera**\u00a0  I\u2019m not a professional photographer. Like most people, I use my phone\u2019s camera to share photos on social media or send them to friends and family. As we know, apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger tend to degrade photo quality, and in 2024, most flagship phones have good cameras whose potential we don\u2019t fully utilize. However, I did notice some differences between the two phone cameras. Both phones have quite good cameras, not the best on the market, but still very good. Pixel photos have more subdued colors, while OnePlus photos are brighter . Both companies should work on video stabilization. The Pixel has a slight issue with maintaining focus on one thing, making other elements a bit blurry. I like both cameras, and it\u2019s hard to choose a better one - they\u2019re different for sure. If you\u2019re interested, I can take some photos and upload them for comparison (we can do a blind test).**System**\u00a0  The primary reason I opted for a Pixel was its operating system. I was quite frustrated with certain aspects of Android that didn\u2019t function well, and I had heard that Pixels are akin to iPhones in the world of Android. Although I\u2019ve never owned an iPhone, I found little difference between Pixels and other brands. The same issues persist, such as missing notifications (a significant problem, I believe, with the Pixel 8 Pro), and apps being killed in the background. In my view, the main distinction between Pixels and other brands is the absence of certain features. Brands like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Samsung have their own software packed with useful features like Samsung Dex, app cloning, floating windows, etc. Thus, when the system\/software behaves similarly but offers less, the choice is clear.**Additional Annoyances on Pixel:*** As previously mentioned, I encountered issues with notifications. They can be delayed or may not appear at all when the phone screen is off. However, as soon as I turn on the screen, the notifications suddenly appear.* While using the \u201cX\u201d app on Pixel, I often found that post pictures wouldn\u2019t load as I scrolled. Occasionally, switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data or killing the X app and clearing the cache seemed to work. I never experienced this issue on other devices.**Additional Annoyances on OnePlus:*** The OnePlus weather app falls short when compared to the Pixel\u2019s. It\u2019s frustrating that I can\u2019t search for another town\u2019s weather without adding it, or view a more detailed forecast for another day without being redirected to a rather poor website.* I noticed that when I reset the phone (turn it off and then on again), some of my settings revert to their default values. For instance, I had disabled 5G, but it would suddenly be enabled again. Also, the order of my apps\/features in the notification bar would reset.**In Summary**\u00a0In my opinion, the OnePlus 12 significantly outshines Pixel 8 Pro, When compared to the OnePlus, the Pixel appears to be a mid-range phone from 2022, albeit with a commendable camera. The OnePlus 12 triumphs over the Pixel in numerous categories, including:* **Performance*** **Temperature Management*** **Battery Life*** **Charging Speed*** **Connectivity*** **Value for Money\/Box Contents**Pixel fight back only in the following areas:* **Camera Quality*** **Display Quality**","370":"Hi all!Some folks had wanted me to post on my thoughts (and final decision) comparing my S24 Ultra and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.  Here's that post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pixel\\_phones\/comments\/1eyplqm\/bought\\_my\\_parents\\_pixel\\_9s\\_the\\_wife\\_a\\_9\\_pro\\_and\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pixel_phones\/comments\/1eyplqm\/bought_my_parents_pixel_9s_the_wife_a_9_pro_and\/)**My decision after a little less than a day of use:** *I'm keeping the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and will be selling my S24 Ultra.*Here are the main points and reasons why I'm going 9 Pro Fold:* **Cameras**: This is the biggest category to me, and I thoroughly enjoy having flagship cameras and never really thinking about whether or not I'm getting the best in photography from a mobile device in auto mode.  I don't shoot in RAW or Pro modes 99% of the time so that's not a huge consideration for me, though both have those options if you need it. Google's camera app is simply superior in showing the information you need, has less lag, and I like their post processing color science compared to Samsung's.  I was shocked that standard shooting, wide angle, and tele photos up to about 10x were very comparable and like I said, I like Google's post processing better.  I think this is going to be a contentious take but the 9 Pro Fold's Cameras met (and sometimes) what I was hoping to get. I don't shoot a lot of video but it shoots 1080p and 4K footage pretty well, to boot.* **Feel**: I cannot stand the sharp corners of the S24 Ultra, and really miss my S21 Ultra for it's in hand feel.  I have a case for the S24 Ultra that makes it more bearable but I prefer to be *happy* with the feel.  The 9 Pro Fold has rounded corners on the right side while closed ( hold it there mostly), and rounded on all corners when unfolded.  I've been using the phone opened around 80% of the time so this is a major win in my opinion.* **THE INNER SCREEN**: Y'all have used foldables, seen countless videos, and know what a bigger screen means. It has been an absolute delight using a massive screen to browse the web, reddit, use chat apps and keep a floating YouTube window  without feeling like I'm losing out in much in those apps.  Split screening apps work very well generally, too.  It's got vivid colors, quick to respond, and the S24 Ultra doesn't have one of these!* **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 vs. Tensor G4**: I don't do heavy gaming and generally do low key gaming when I do (check out [https:\/\/www.kingdomrush.com\/](https:\/\/www.kingdomrush.com\/), best tower defense games ever IMO) so that's not a big consideration for me.  Day to day use is showing that the G4 performs just fine and seems to be as smooth as my S24 Ultra in everything I do.  It's honestly slightly less buggy feeling since there aren't duplicate services\/apps needed for every dang thing (many of which I opted out of and used Google's versions anyway on the S24 Ultra), so another thing for the 9 Pro Fold. If you game on mobile heavily, you may want to try one out or watch reviews that do proper gaming testing (seems to be alright, though).* **Flavor of Android**: building on what I said in the last bullet point, I prefer Google's twists on it's own OS vs. what Samsung does almost all of the time. No app redundancies, significantly less overhead on the system in apps that run in the background, INSANELY fast shut down\/boot up times on the 9 Pro Fold, etc.  Many of you have been in both ecosystems and you may prefer one over the other, but I think most want the Samsung hardware with Google's flavor of Android.* **Screens in the sun**: I'm going to have to test this but I don't think the 9 Pro Fold not having the anti reflective coating that the S24 Ultra has will be the end of the world.  I've enjoyed being able to see my phone without issue in the sun on the S24 Ultra, but I also don't use my phone for more than a moment or two in the bright sun.  I don't think I can personally let this be the reason why I don't keep the 9 Pro Fold. The 9 Pro Fold's screens get wicked bright so I'm guessing that'll be enough to quell this loss.* **Charging and battery**: I charge my phone throughout the day due to working in IT and having some desk time here and there.  I also place it on a slow wireless charger at night.  I don't get people that can 1) run a modern phone empty and 2) aren't aware of small, portable battery chargers or 3) able to carry a charger if they're really beating their phones down to single digit percentages. I think most scenarios I see are just irresponsible people so IMO, figure that out. Wired charging worked very well and was at 20w basically until 80%, then went to around 10\/15w then out (every battery does this). The phone seems to last and last, though, and I have been doing a mix of video watching, web browsing, using apps like Reddit and other chat apps. It seems to have really great battery life generally. As long as you sleep and can plug it in, I don't foresee this being a problem for a majority of people.* **Weight**: It weighs something like 25g more than the S24 ultra, aka, peanuts.  I barely notice it and the only reason I do is that with a case, it's slightly thicker than my S24 Ultra with a case.  This doesn't at all matter to me and I'm impressed with the 9 Pro Fold's packaging overall.I'm droning on now but feel free to ask questions and I'll be glad to try and answer them!  If you're just ordering a 9 Pro Fold, good luck waiting the 1-50 months since it seems to be quite a wait for some now. :-(","371":"My actual xiaomi 12 pro phone broke 3 days ago, and I'm thinking between these 2 phones and I'm struggling really hard to decide:1. **I am objectively more comfortable with android** as I never had an iPhone before, the amount of personalization, (including things like \\*cof cof\\* youtube ReV\\_\\_\\_. I know the Brave solution on apple with android adds but it seems so meh).2. **The camera:** I honestly didn't know apple DON'T have a \"pro\" camera mode in its default camera app, lol... I like the Pixel camera way more in the comparison I've seen.3. **Social media integration**: But on the other hand... I don't know if it's worth it to have such a good camera, better than the iPhone in some aspects, but the iPhone just shares it better with social media apps like Instagram. I am really concerned about that, since I always felt that problem with my Xiaomi 12 pro: awesome camera, but lost a lot of detail sharing the results of it in my profile.4. **Value:** As far as I know, iPhones doesn't decrease it's price as much as Pixel phones does, right? So I don't know if it's worth it paying for a new Pixel 9 pro if in a few months it will be much cheaper, but I won't have that feeling with the iPhone as iPhones don't lower the price that fast... And I'm not interested in Pixel 8, and don't have time to wait since I can't rely more on my actual phone.5. **Long-term:** The processor power of Pixel is quite low compared to iPhone and Samsung equivalents. I know that for a normal user, it's a more than enough processor, but I'm concerned that in a few years the Pixel 9 pro could feel behind iPhone and Samsung like a mid range phone nowadays. Pixel has better battery tho, that's better.6. Not personally an Apple fan, but I don't hate it, **I personally feel more attached to the android\/google ecosystem** and values as a company (not perfect tho, has its problems)... I don't really like Apple as a company (don't hate it either but I just don't now if it's for me, probably I just haven't tried it or is a real factor?)Btw I just don't care about Apple Intelligence or Gemini, it's not an important factor for me.Any help? Thanks!","372":"Post:Hi everyone,I\u2019m considering switching from my iPhone 15 Pro Max to the new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and I\u2019d love to hear your opinions and experiences. What made you switch from one of these phones to the other, or why did you decide to stick with your current device?Here\u2019s what I love about the iPhone:\t\u2022\tThe iOS ecosystem \u2013 I use a Mac and iPad, so the integration is seamless.\t\u2022\tPerformance and smooth app experience.\t\u2022\tHardware quality and design.But the Pixel tempts me with:\t\u2022\tPhotography \u2013 Google is still considered top-notch in this area.\t\u2022\tAndroid customization and flexibility.\t\u2022\tClean software with no bloat and fast updates.My concerns:\t\u2022\tWill I miss the Apple ecosystem?\t\u2022\tBattery life \u2013 Pixels had some issues in the past.

I\u2019m curious about the perspective of people who switched to a Pixel and those who ended up going back to an iPhone.Thanks for any advice! \ud83d\ude0a","373":"Fellow brethren, This is something that I did for eeking out the maximum battery on the Pixel, without sacrificing any features in the previous guides I've seen here.(Switching back to 60hz, uninstalling social media apps etc).So I've had the Pixel 8 for almost 2 months now. The battery life when I received the phone was around 5hr SOT, which got better after the adaptive battery kicked in (6hrs). Now as the days passed, I felt this itch to squeeze more out of the phone battery. I got good reports of battery usage on the Android 15 beta, so I switched over. Now the SOT became 6.5hrs. Not good enough. Then I took the steps below, and the phone gets around 8hrs SOT regularly. It's also important to note that I never had any issues with my phone like call drops or shitty signal or random reboots etc. I use internet and WiFi sparingly and the battery stats here are not just on WiFi. Also bear in mind that I'm on A15 beta. The phone is flawless for me.1. Use a really good battery monitor. Pixel inline battery monitor is okay, but it's not great. BetterBatteryStats is the king of all monitors. But sadly it doesn't work on android 15 :( . So I used two: Accubattery and Gsam battery monitor. Both are really good. But Gsam has more data recording and visualization (graphs for heat, battery, CPU usage and a lot more). Also accubattery doesn't record how much battery the phone signal, WiFi, CPU, android system, Kernel etc use. While Gsam records all those and wakelocks of your phone. You can get the premium versions from Mobilism (listed in the wiki of r\/piracy) which I think gives you some extra features. You will need to grant Gsam some extra permissions with adb.2. Install macrodroid and get the \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro from the macro repository inside the app. If you understand, feel free to move on to the next one, but  If you find the above sentence dense, here's a breakdown:Macrodroid is an app which executes macros(scripts) that you install on the phone. For example, you can install a macro to turn on flashlight when you shake the phone, or turn off WiFi if no networks are detected within 20 seconds etc.Now, there is a huge repository for macros inside the app itself(in the bottom panel and then search for it), and the one that you want to install is called \"Enhance battery life V2\" macro. This enables battery saver when the phone is locked. Locking it to 60hz and putting tasks into idle quicker. Hence you get very low standby drain on the phone! You might need to give macrodroid admin rights on the phone and enable android.permissions.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS via adb. (Don't worry, it'll be given in the macro instructions what to do or a quick Google search will help you out.) Screenshot attached of how the macro should look like finally.3. Using savetuner. This is a FOSS app which changes how your batterysaver mode deals with applications. You can set extreme savings to default settings in the app. I set it to extreme and tweaked the settings a bit (screenshot attached) to get real time updates from apps, but also put them into deep sleep otherwise. Now this pairs very well with the macro above as your phone does the extreme saving when it's locked! The phone also doesn't kill apps in memory and I have retrieved an open YT video hours later at the same point from the recents menu! 4. Use 4G. I know this might be a deal breaker for some people, but for me it works great. I get the speeds I want from it, the phone doesn't heat up and stays cool. I also haven't had any drops in signal or inability to receive calls etc. Also, my location is off mostly and Bluetooth is on most times, connected with my watch.5. (Optional) Using A15 beta. Things are much much smoother. The animations, the performance of the phone etc. If you do update, clear the storage of Device health services app everytime you do it. This will reset the adaptive battery and brightness stats. For some reason, this helps the battery life. I also have now playing, Ok Google and all the bells and whistles of the Pixel device on.6. Debloat your Pixel phone. Yes, you heard me right. Pixel OS is supposed to come with no bloat, but it isn't. There are codes and processes which are useless running all the time in the background.There is an amazing FOSS app called 'Canta' which helps your debloat your phone. It has a tag called recommended which recommends the apps you can debloat. They have been tested such that, if you remove it nothing breaks. It has a description of what the app does if you click on it, so you can decide if you want to remove it. I've attached screenshots of the apps I kept on the phone out of the recommended bloat such that you don't lose any features. If you accidentally uninstall any app that you want, don't worry. You can easily reinstall it anytime using the same app! (I don't use android auto or safety or pixel tips etc, so you don't find them in the save list. You can decide for yourself with the descriptions)7. Use the 20 - 80 rule. I charge my phone almost always in the range for maximum battery life. I use battery to check the current battery health (even though I doubt the accuracy). My last phone (Realme), I ran it for 6 years with the same battery with this rule.8. Using Icebox and disabling background usage. Icebox is an app which disables any app that you select, when you lock your phone. My biggest standby drainers were Instagram,Snapchat and Mull ( a hardened version of Firefox). Mull has been fixed now so I've added Instagram and Snapchat to Icebox. Now this will freeze the app (like you disabled it), so you won't be able to find in the app drawer when you unlock your phone. No worries, you can add a shortcut from icebox for any app you freeze so that you can open it after unlocking the screen! I've also disabled background usage for some apps like WhatsApp, but this will result in you losing access to microphone if you minimize WhatsApp when during a call.9. Things I wish could improve: Video calling. I do a lot of WhatsApp video calls and this eats battery like crazy. I wish Google would improve the optimization of battery on video calls.10. If you reached this far, here's a BONUS tip! If you have rooted your phone, the Sultan Kernel for pixel 8 is an amazing option for battery and performance. I've heard reports of less heat, battery consumption and snappier performance. He's doing what Google Devs should do and for the benefit of the community. So check it out! Thanks for listening! I hope people can benefit from what I did so that you can enjoy your Pixel device. Let me know if you have any questions!","374":"Switching from a Google Pixel 8 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max was a decision driven by several critical factors that significantly impacted my daily use and overall satisfaction with the Pixel device.Firstly, one of the major issues I encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro was its abysmal battery life. Despite efforts to conserve power such as using low screen resolution and disabling unnecessary features, I could barely manage 3 to 4 hours of screen-on time on 4G. This severely restricted my ability to use the phone throughout the day without needing frequent recharges.Secondly, charging the Pixel 8 Pro was a frustratingly slow process, regardless of the charging method or accessories used. Even with fast chargers, the device took an unreasonably long time to replenish its battery, adding to the inconvenience caused by its poor battery longevity.Another significant drawback was the inconsistent performance of its 4G and 5G antennas. I frequently experienced dropped calls, slow data speeds, and poor signal reception in areas where other devices showed better connectivity. This unreliable network performance greatly hindered my productivity and communication while on the go.Furthermore, the photo and video editing capabilities of the Pixel 8 Pro fell short of expectations. Basic tasks such as trimming a short video clip often took an unexpectedly long time, which was frustrating when trying to quickly edit and share content. This sluggish performance impacted my workflow and creative projects negatively.In terms of overall performance, the Pixel 8 Pro lagged behind other flagship smartphones in its class. Apps frequently stuttered, and there were noticeable delays in executing commands and multitasking. This subpar performance was particularly disappointing considering the device's positioning as a premium smartphone.Lastly, the artificial intelligence (AI) features touted by the Pixel 8 Pro did not deliver as promised. While Google's AI capabilities are renowned, I found that the practical applications and user experience fell short of the seamless integration and usefulness expected from such technologies.Given these persistent issues and frustrations with the Pixel 8 Pro, I made the decision to switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone offered superior battery life, faster charging capabilities, reliable network connectivity, and smoother overall performance. Its robust ecosystem of apps and services, coupled with intuitive software features, addressed the shortcomings I experienced with the Pixel 8 Pro.In conclusion, my transition from the Pixel 8 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max was driven by a need for a more reliable and efficient smartphone experience. Despite the storage capacity difference, the iPhone's performance, battery life, and ecosystem better suited my professional and personal needs, providing a significant upgrade in usability and satisfaction compared to the Pixel.(i paid same price for the 15 pro max, just got 200 gigs less)","375":"Hello, it's nearly upgrading time for me with my carrier however I'm really stuck on what I should get this time around.(Just for some context I've used both iOS and Android before for years at a time and have never really intergrated into either ecosystem, nor would I really like to.)I've been on a Samsung S23 for a while now and havn't had the greatest experience. It's been choppy, buggy and just generally doesn't feel like a phone you'd be paying nearly a grand for, meanwhile my most recent iOS experience (iPhone 12) felt the exact same way to me being just a generally unpleastent experience.Meanwhile I've seen many ex-iPhone and ex-Samsung users praising the Google Pixel for being the best of both worlds, with the simplicity and polish of iOS and customization and freedom that comes with running on Android. I've never used one myself and I'm not sure if I'd want one considering I barely use any of the headlining features on android (sideloading, indepth customization, ect), the most customization I do on my phone is a wallpaper and maybe a few widget, I don't use my phone for much other than texting, scrolling social media and the occasional photo editing if I'm out and about.The only thing that's super important in a phone for me is the ability to take decent photos, which any phone can do nowadays. I'm unsure which would be a better fit for me and which I should get.","376":"Long, long post about my experience switching extremely budget phones to a proper flagship (Google Pixel 8 Pro)# Background:I've always been interested in tech but I am heavily against consumerism and overpaying for material things (ahem, Apple) and have since smartphones arrived, used phones based on my need. My needs? Browse internet, read the news, social media, reddit, work email. That is extremely average use. You absolutely don't need a flagship phone for this. Just to give you an idea how budget my previous phones have been, **these are my last 4 phones from most recent to the oldest**: Xiaomi Poco M4 (170$), Redmi Note 7 (200$), Mi A2 Lite(200$) and a knock off, no name Chinese brand Le Eco that could've been 100$ from Aliexpress way back in 2016. And as far my day to day tasks go, they all handled it fine. It's interesting to note that Mi A2 Lite was an Android One phone as well. Also note, I have been paying for Google One subscription for cloud storage a long time now, so I'm not a stranger to it's AI features either.I think this thread might be interesting to you, tech fans, because generally most of you come from other flagships (Samsung, iPhones)I DO like photography but the past 4 years the improvements in phone cameras have been so abysmal that I just couldn't convince myself to spend 1000$ for a camera that is still worse than my 6 year old Sony APS-C camera.I feel that now, 2024, we are finally entering an age where cameras are finally improving, thanks to bigger sensor size. Xiaomi Ultra 14 caught my eye and I ordered that. But I cancelled that order as soon I heard that the camera might fog, and I live in a place with heavy rain and snow, so no way I would pay 1100\u20ac to risk not even using the camera.Instead, I ordered brand new Google Pixel 8 Pro for 550\u20ac. Yes, technically not a flagship anymore, as P9P is out, but I still consider it a flagship phone. It's insane how much the price dropped, thus I saw the most value in that.**I was extremely skeptical of the hardware** and specs, really thought that I'm making a huge mistake buying P8P. I also have a pretty negative outlook on Google in general, I never thought of Pixel as a serious project because Google has a great track record of killing projects (https:\/\/killedbygoogle.com\/) but now I understand the business behind it - they are not even attempting to make money off mobile sales. They needed to compete with Apple and Samsung just so they could have better deals on Android, Play Store, Google Search and so on. As soon I understood that, it gave me spark that Pixel might not be a one-off project at all (obviously isn't since there's 9 generations out already)# My experience:I have now used it for a couple of weeks. I took it out of the box and immediatelly put on a protector and case. First impressions.Visually, I think Pixels are ugly, ugly phones. All except for P9 series, P9 looks a lot better. But I have never bought phones based on their looks, so that's not important. I put on a Nikkin case and the phone actually looks kinda good now.Also, for a flagship you'd expect a better box - the box you get the product from is extremely underwhelming, worst first impression ever. All my sub 200$ cheap phones have come with cases, chargers, and the boxes have looked a lot more premium. But, I don't buy a phone for it's box, so whatever.# The pros:* It's really fast* The rear camera is very good. I take a lot of photos and videos. It doesn't replace my Sony camera during daylight, but definitely outperforms it in low light. The 5x optical zoom is great. The 30x digital zoom is fun to play with as a gimmick.* Battery is ok* Screen is really good* Everything just works. GPS, call reception, bluetooth, works as intended. My Xiaomis had odd cases of GPS being really poor.# The cons:* Battery charging time. I never thought I'd care about this, because as a long time Xiaomi user I've seen Xiaomi go from 30w charging to 60w to 90w to 120w charging in the last 2 years. Seeing how P8P max support is 30W is wild to me. It will charge full in about a hour or hour and half but I'm just surprised.* Some gestures are missing. Taking a screenshot is a massive pain in the butt, u need to click volume and shut down button - and based on Jerryrigseverything video, I am pretty sure I will wear\/break these buttons out using it for screenshots. But it's slooow. The classic 3 finger swipe is such a good gesture, I thought it's default by Android, but turns out it's not.* The selfie camera. Holy shit it's bad. It's really, really bad. Especially photos but videos are pretty bad as well, this is where the inferior hardware really pops out.# SummaryTruly flagship experience for 550\u20ac, insane value. I am now a believer. Pixel is the real deal.   ","377":"I currently have a iPhone 13 mini 128 gb and I was thinking of upgrading to a pixel phone. Honestly the biggest reason is my battery can only last half a day on a full charge and I am in need of a better phone. Plus, it's getting boring, I know the app integration is better in ios but they are just not fun phones in my experience. And the new 16s don't really seem like a huge change.I just have a iPhone and Mac so I'm not super invested in the ecosystem.I don't really know much about pixel phones but if it fits my needs I might get one: * Great camera - Takes good lowlight shots and has optical zoom* Long battery life* Nice display - I watch Netflix and other media on my phone often* Good processor","378":"I was eagerly anticipating the Pixel 9, especially after all the hype about its AI capabilities. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen AI that could actually be useful in daily life, not just as a chatbot. But after just a few minutes of using the phone, I\u2019m already highly disappointed. None of the much-touted features are available in languages like Czech, which is frustrating considering this is the second generation of Pixels officially sold in the Czech Republic. Google's loud claims about AI being accessible in many languages worldwide just don\u2019t hold up here. At least Apple was quite clear about the availability of Apple Intelligence.Here\u2019s a breakdown:**Pixel Screenshots:**  The app opens, but it's entirely in English despite my system language being Czech. Even worse, the AI features aren\u2019t available because it says my system language isn't supported. It doesn't even specify which languages are supported, which is infuriating.**Pixel Studio:**  The app won\u2019t open unless you switch the language to English. Once you do, it functions, but prompts must be in English. This is far from the seamless, multilingual experience Google advertised.**Call Notes:**  This was the biggest letdown. Not only is it unsupported in Czech, but the feature doesn\u2019t even show up in the UI. The same goes for transcription, \"Hold for Me,\" and the ability to record calls. It\u2019s incredibly disappointing to see these features completely missing.**Gemini:**  While Gemini supports Czech (finally, something does!), it's basically just a web-based chatbot with no integration into the phone's ecosystem. There's no connection to Google Assistant, no weather reports, no calendar or Keep integration, and no smart home control. It\u2019s not even connected to the Search. When I asked about a major local fire, it claimed it couldn\u2019t search for it and it told me to use Google Search. Also, \"Hey Google\" isn\u2019t available. Gemini Live isn\u2019t either, but at least Google made it clear that this feature is US-only for now.**Magic Editor:**  This feature is essentially unchanged from the Pixel 8 series. You can ask the AI to fill in gaps in an image or modify the sky, but you can\u2019t write anything down because the option simply doesn\u2019t exist.**Pixel Weather:**  The app itself looks terrible\u2014no animations, an inaccurate weather map, and no AI summarization. It feels like an afterthought.**Other AI Features:**  No transcription or summarization in the Recorder app, and no text proofreading or style suggestions in Google Messages.Before anyone says that the Czech Republic is too small of a market to matter, keep in mind that Google has an official presence here, complete with a Google Store and booths in every electronics shop. If Google is going to spend hours hyping up AI features during they presentation,  they need to deliver\u2014or at least be transparent about the limitations. It\u2019s frustrating and misleading to pay the same premium price as US customers while receiving a fraction of the features. And for Pixel 8 Pro users, there\u2019s literally no reason to upgrade to the Pixel 9.Let this post serve as a warning for anyone who doesn\u2019t use a widely spoken language\u2014think twice before buying the Pixel 9.-Frustrated Pixel fan","379":"I\u2019ve always been an apple user, i\u2019ve got an ipad air 5, airpods max and iphone 15 plus among others. The thing is, lately i\u2019ve been attracted to phones such as the Pixel 8 or the S24 ultra and today i had a horrible experience with the apple customer service at the apple store. After today, i\u2019m thinking about going all in and letting go of ios, the only problem i could see is the loss of quality in social media usage and not being able to join my family\/friends on facetime or when airdropping things. what do you guys think, should i sell my iphone 15 and buy an android flagship or should i just play it safe? ","380":"Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been using the Pixel 8 Pro (P8P) for about half a year and the OnePlus 12 (OP12) for about a month. I thought it would be a good time to compare these two phones. As an Android Developer with 10 years of experience, I consider myself a demanding user who uses the phone for a variety of purposes including normal usage, fun, and work.To start with, I purchased the Pixel 8 Pro 12\/256 version for 1159\u20ac from the Google Store, which included the Google Pixel Watch 2 as a pre-order bonus. The OnePlus 12 (16\/512 version) was bought from TradingShenzhen for approximately 670\u20ac. Currently, the Pixel 8 Pro can be purchased for around 850\u20ac.**Let\u2019s talk about the packaging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro comes only with a USB-C cable, which in my opinion, is of really poor quality. I\u2019ve had connection issues with these cables from Google from time to time. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 comes with a 100W charger, a USB-C cable, and a classic case. Considering the package and price, the OnePlus 12 is a clear winner for me.**Moving on to the battery and charging.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a 5000mAh battery while the OnePlus 12 has a 5400mAh capacity. But that\u2019s just raw data that anyone can Google. In practice, I find the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s battery to be quite disappointing. Despite numerous optimizations, I was only able to achieve around 5 hours of screen-on time (SOT) (with lower resolution, disabled 5G, location and other permissions disabled for most apps, and battery optimizations). On the other hand, achieving 7 hours of SOT on the OnePlus 12 is quite normal without any optimizations. I use both phones with lower resolution and higher refresh rate. The Pixel 8 Pro can be charged at a maximum speed of 30W, but we need a special charger for that (the same is true for the OnePlus, but they provide the charger). I tried charging the Pixel with a bunch of chargers that I have at home, and the maximum speed that I reached was 20W, which is quite poor. The combination of poor battery life and slow charging speed is really annoying. In this case, the OnePlus 12 with its 100W charging speed is the clear winner.**Let\u2019s discuss the screen.**   The Pixel 8 Pro has a flat 1344x2992 6.70\" screen and the OnePlus 12 has a curved 1440x3168 6.82\" screen. Both are really great screens. The OnePlus 12 has slightly higher brightness and resolution. However, the main differences for me are that the Pixel\u2019s screen is flat and the OnePlus\u2019s is curved, and the screen color options (Google gives us 2 options and OnePlus gives us 3 options and an additional manual adjust option). The OnePlus 12 is my first phone with a curved screen and I often feel insecure about it. I\u2019ve stopped placing the phone screen down because I\u2019m worried about it. Also, when I look at the screen from a specific angle on the curved side, it looks strange (different colors). But for normal usage, it\u2019s okay, and gestures may be easier. If we are looking at specifications, the OP12 is the winner (higher brightness, higher resolution, and curved screens are more expensive), but for me, both of them are at a really high level.  **Performance \/ Heating**\u00a0  When it comes to efficiency and temperature management, the OnePlus 12, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, completely outclasses the Google Tensor 3 in the Pixel. The Pixel tends to heat up during normal usage on mobile data (LTE), and even more so during gaming, leading to a noticeable drop in performance. On the other hand, the OnePlus 12 only gets slightly warm when unplugged from its 100W charger, and it\u2019s still cooler than the Pixel charging at 20W. Comparing the OnePlus 12\u2019s performance with the Pixel 8 Pro feels like comparing this year\u2019s flagship with a mid-range phone from 2020-2022. The OnePlus 12 is the clear winner here.**Connectivity**\u00a0  Connectivity might seem like an odd category, but it\u2019s quite important to me. I have the Chinese version of the OnePlus 12 (without eSIM), and I must say, I was initially worried about network coverage. However, it\u2019s noticeably better than the Google Pixel. Even when testing my Wi-Fi range, the results were shocking. I connected both phones to the same Wi-Fi network and moved to the farthest corner of my home. At this point, the OnePlus still had full range (4\/4), while the Pixel was down to half (2\/4). Running several speed tests, the OnePlus consistently achieved about 120 Mbps, while the Pixel only managed 20 Mbps - that\u2019s a five-fold difference! The OnePlus also outperforms the Pixel in terms of mobile data coverage.**Camera**\u00a0  I\u2019m not a professional photographer. Like most people, I use my phone\u2019s camera to share photos on social media or send them to friends and family. As we know, apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger tend to degrade photo quality, and in 2024, most flagship phones have good cameras whose potential we don\u2019t fully utilize. However, I did notice some differences between the two phone cameras. Both phones have quite good cameras, not the best on the market, but still very good. Pixel photos have more subdued colors, while OnePlus photos are brighter . Both companies should work on video stabilization. The Pixel has a slight issue with maintaining focus on one thing, making other elements a bit blurry. I like both cameras, and it\u2019s hard to choose a better one - they\u2019re different for sure. If you\u2019re interested, I can take some photos and upload them for comparison (we can do a blind test).**System**\u00a0  The primary reason I opted for a Pixel was its operating system. I was quite frustrated with certain aspects of Android that didn\u2019t function well, and I had heard that Pixels are akin to iPhones in the world of Android. Although I\u2019ve never owned an iPhone, I found little difference between Pixels and other brands. The same issues persist, such as missing notifications (a significant problem, I believe, with the Pixel 8 Pro), and apps being killed in the background. In my view, the main distinction between Pixels and other brands is the absence of certain features. Brands like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Samsung have their own software packed with useful features like Samsung Dex, app cloning, floating windows, etc. Thus, when the system\/software behaves similarly but offers less, the choice is clear.**Additional Annoyances on Pixel:*** As previously mentioned, I encountered issues with notifications. They can be delayed or may not appear at all when the phone screen is off. However, as soon as I turn on the screen, the notifications suddenly appear.* While using the \u201cX\u201d app on Pixel, I often found that post pictures wouldn\u2019t load as I scrolled. Occasionally, switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data or killing the X app and clearing the cache seemed to work. I never experienced this issue on other devices.**Additional Annoyances on OnePlus:*** The OnePlus weather app falls short when compared to the Pixel\u2019s. It\u2019s frustrating that I can\u2019t search for another town\u2019s weather without adding it, or view a more detailed forecast for another day without being redirected to a rather poor website.* I noticed that when I reset the phone (turn it off and then on again), some of my settings revert to their default values. For instance, I had disabled 5G, but it would suddenly be enabled again. Also, the order of my apps\/features in the notification bar would reset.**In Summary**\u00a0In my opinion, the OnePlus 12 significantly outshines Pixel 8 Pro, When compared to the OnePlus, the Pixel appears to be a mid-range phone from 2022, albeit with a commendable camera. The OnePlus 12 triumphs over the Pixel in numerous categories, including:* **Performance*** **Temperature Management*** **Battery Life*** **Charging Speed*** **Connectivity*** **Value for Money\/Box Contents**Pixel fight back only in the following areas:* **Camera Quality*** **Display Quality**","381":"I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device","382":"I have seen a lot of bad reviews\/complaints about pixel phones and I thought I would share my (mostly) positive experiences. I bought my phone in 2021 and I've had an overall great experience. Pros: -fast and responsive-easily share files-cellular and data connection always great-multiple users worked seamlessly-photos and photo editing are good (my wife's Samsung seems to take better quality videos though) -Bluetooth connection to multiple devices easily -battery life adequate for my needs  Obviously it's not a perfect phone, some cons: -Android 14 update fiasco, couldn't save files, couldn't take photos for about 10 days -Android auto glitches occasionally, calls wouldn't connect to the car audio, but it must have been fixed since it hasn't happened in a few months -I miss the Pixel 5 back pingerprint sensor-when a phone call or notification interrupts playing music on phone (not connected to Bluetooth) it turns down the music volume after the notification  Considering all this, I still enjoyed the past 3 years with my phone. I'm interested in anyone else's Pixel 6 experiences whether positive or negative. ","383":"PIXEL 9 PRO XL in the picture in Hazel (Europe) I don't know guys the aluminum sides alone makes it look 10 times cheaper (why people enjoy Iphone's lame ass design is beyond me - please bring back HTC ONE M7-, now brands have to copy it smh) . Samsung S24 Ultra has that premium quality, you can't beat that (the pen is xtra light though), and is heavier. The more squared sides did not trouble me at all, as well as its weight. Since each 9 model displayed could not be tested, i compared the Pixel 8 Pro with the S24 Ultra, assuming that the Pixel 9 is faster than the 8 and let me tell you...i did notice how much snappier the S24 ultra is. Samsung just glides with every task, hella smooth. Not to mention the crisp display, although i did enjoy more the colors on the Pixel 8 Pro. Camera wise? Samsung is alright, picture quality is not less, not more than what you get with any latest Android phone. Did not impress me at all. Still prefer the Pixel's. That's it, just wanted to give my two cents.Waiting for the hands-on reviews is agonizing lolS24 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro XL? Which would make you change your daily smartphone? I'm leaning towards the Pixel despite...you know...Tensor and a potential risk of the flagship overheating...how was your experience with the Pixel 8 series? ","384":"Let me preface this that I absolutely LOVE the Pixel software, I believe it is very lightweight, no-nonsense and incredibly optimised compared to stuff like Xiaomi and Samsung. Additionally, I make heavy use of a wide variety of Google apps and services, so swapping to iOS or is out of the question for me.It looks like for my use case and requirements, the Pixel 9 would be the best phone. Amazingly optimised software on top of homegrown hardware and hands down the best photo quality in all phones. However, each review points out that the Tensor G4 is nowhere near as fast as the competition and that the video quality of the Pixel 9 is not as good as it should be for a flagship phone?To the current owners and users of this phone, what do you think? Do you really find this phone slow and stuttery and the video quality subpar?EDIT: Let me also add that I have no intentions of gaming, but I would like to have a device which is born fast and stays fast for at least 5 years, just like Apple is doing with their iPhones","385":"This is a long post for those of you who might consider buying yourself or someone else an iPhone.So I've been a pixel fan for a while, I had the nexus 5, 6, 5x, and loved every one.But after one small stint on a Samsung, I was unimpressed. (happy to talk about this comparison too)So I decided after years on hating on Apple, I decided to give it a good old college try with the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021.At first I loved it, it was responsive, the apps were well designed, it's just a pretty polished experience.Then the little things wrong just started to pile up.NATIVE APPSNothing wrong with facetime, imessage, airdrop, etc. But their Google equivalent is just as good. So it wasn't like this life-changing thing that iPhone users made it out to be. Kind of confused why they're so popular. Maybe because they're ignorant of what Google has? IDK. It's bizarre.NAVIGATION OF THE UII'm also dumbfounded about the swiping navigation on iPhone. You can go back a page by swiping from left to right, but only if it's an app that supports gestures in-app. Which means there are many apps that don't support the \"back\" gesture, and only have an arrow to go back at the top left corner of the screen. ...WHAT?! So I can't go back a page if I'm holding my phone in my right hand. ...WHAT?! So basically, if the gesture method doesn't work, I have to do some kind of hand gymnastics just to navigate within an app. That's crazy. This was a huge hole in the idea that iOS was \"polished\" or \"cohesive\".NOTIFICATIONSAnd notifications...by FAR the MOST infuriating thing on iOS. Sure, you can customize where the notifications show up, (lock screen, banner, notification center), you can select if it makes sound or not, or if you want it in your summary, all good options to have.But if you want to select which kind of notifications you get from an app, the in-app settings better have an option to disable certain ones, or else you have to disable ALL notifications from that app. That leaves it up to the developer to tell you what kind of notifications you get to see. Oh and if you get a notification you don't like, you don't have the option to change any notification settings from the notification itself. You can turn all of them off or all of them on. That's it. Can't even swipe them away in any direction either. it's only from right to left. THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE BACK SWIPE GESTURE.The design is atrocious, stacking is ugly and cluttered. You can't even take any action from the notification itself unless the app has enabled it. You have to open each app to do anything with that notification like 50% of the time. It's totally random what you can and cannot do with a notification on any given app. Just a guessing game, hoping and praying a feature works. Gross.SILENT MODEAlso, an easy feature android has ALWAYS had that iOS just doesn't care about (?!?!?!?) is a VIBRATE-ONLY mode. WHY NOT HAVE THIS?! It would be so easy and make so much sense. It would work great with the mute switch, because you could decide if mute = silent, or vibrate only. This is just a blatant \"we don't really care what the users want\" problem.SIRIAnd the ugly nuisance that Apple is somehow still proud of, Siri. She activates when she's not supposed to, doesn't understand basic requests outside of math equations and timers. You want to ask a general knowledge question and have her answer you by voice? SHE CAN'T DO THAT. She can display search results on screen. THAT'S IT. Can't make a phone call to a public number unless it's in your contacts, doesn't work while driving (only calls to contacts and texts), and REGULARLY miss-understands my non-accented California English. I NEVER use it. It's faster, much more effective to open the google app, and tap the microphone, and ask Google. It rarely lets me down. My google home is a blessing when I get home because it just works.PHOTOGRAPHYI'm a photographer, and love pushing mobile imaging to the limit, and don't get me wrong, the video looks great, but the photos...They're serviceable. That's it. Never shocked me at how good they were, how much color, dynamic range or detail they have. I was never impressed. Just satisfied. I still prefer to bring a camera with me even if my iPhone could take the photo decently. It almost always blows out the highlights and darkens the shadows even with HDR enabled. I'm constantly using the exposure slider to adjust what it thinks is the right level.And the portrait mode...what a PAIN. Being in a VERY specific window of distance from the subject for the effect to work at all is SO annoying. I'd have to ask people to stand still every time, while I do a weird one step forward, two steps back dance trying to take a picture. I hate it. And FORGET about taking a portrait image of an object. The iPhone has no clue what it's looking at.None of this was ever a concern on the Pixel. It just worked and would regularly blow me away.CONCLUSIONSo my wife got the Pixel 6 last year, and every time I use it, I'm looking at the photos, the UI, the colors, the screen, and the beautiful, unobtrusive hole punch camera and saying to myself, \"dang, I shouldn't have switched at all.\" That's what I thought at first, but I actually am glad I did try iOS, because now I have conducted an experiment with experience, and I can conclude that pure Android on a Pixel is THE mobile experience to have.And now I'm just counting the days until I pay off this iPhone and trade it in for a Pixel 8 when it comes out. I was not crazy about the Pixel sizes being so big, but at this point, that's not enough of a reason to keep me from it.I am a little hesitant about the video quality and editing ability on mobile, but at this point, it can't be bad enough to keep me from switching.I already exclusively use google cal, photos, and chrome, so the transition won't be hard. I just have to sell my Apple watch (which I actually love) because it only works with iPhone. (SO STUPID)If you're at all curious, absolutely try it out for comparison's sake, but don't lock yourself in. It's not as good, they don't update features as quickly as they need to compete. No feature they have is worth giving up ALL the advancements that Android makes constantly.To the Pixel community: I'm sorry I left for two years, I'm coming home soon.TL;DR:tried ios for two years, so many infuriating things add up to a sub-par experience. I miss pixel. I'll probably buy the P8.","386":"I just ordered my Pixel 9 Pro XL 512 GB today for $ 275, looking forward to unpack it on christmas. And now I keep watching comparisons to the S24 Ultra and combing through reddit for reviews and experiences.Why? Because I have this terrible and irrational habit of always wanting the best when it comes to electronical devices especially.So here I am, second-guessing my decision of buying the phone for these reasons: On paper, the S24U is a more powerful phone. And the upcoming S25U will probably even increase that lead. And what if the Pixel 10 finally gets a \"better\" chip, that is on par with a Snapdragon? Do I need the extra power of the Samsung? No, I do not hardcore game or edit videos at all. In all other regards, I expect to prefer the Pixel anyways - UI, how it looks and feels, the camera and so on..it is just the CPU thing.So you see, I am very unreasonable here. I should be super happy, but I am making myself feel bad due to a bad habit. Maybe you can talk some sense into me; give me some real every day experiences of what you like\/don't like. Whether you notice the slower chip and storage or not.Thank you, fellow Pixel users","387":"Hey everyone,I'm a long-time phone switcher, constantly bouncing between iOS and Android.  Over the past two years, I've gone from the S23 Ultra to the iPhone 15 Pro, then the Pixel 8 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and now I'm on the Pixel 9 Pro.  So, I have some experience with all these flagships.I've been seeing a lot of discussion (and concern) online about the Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 Pro, especially regarding its benchmark scores compared to the A18 Pro and Snapdragon 8 Elite.  While benchmarks are interesting, I'm more concerned about real-world performance for everyday tasks.My question is:  Beyond gaming and heavy video editing, what tangible differences would the average user likely notice between the Pixel 9 Pro, the  S25 Ultra, and the iPhone 16 Pro?  Are we talking about negligible differences, or are there areas where one phone clearly shines over the others in daily use?Specifically, I'm curious about things like: * App smoothness and responsiveness:  Is there a noticeable difference in how quickly apps open and run? * Camera performance:  Beyond just image quality, are there differences in processing speed, shutter lag, or video stabilization? * Battery life:  How do the real-world battery experiences compare? * Software features:  Are there any exclusive or significantly better implementations of features (like AI-powered tools, voice assistants, etc.) on one platform compared to the others? * Overall user experience:  Does one phone feel noticeably \"faster\" or \"smoother\" in day-to-day use?Also, are there any areas where the Tensor G4 actually excels?  Are there any unique features or optimizations that take advantage of its architecture?I'm considering swapping my Pixel 9 Pro for the S25 Ultra if it offers a genuinely better overall experience for my needs. But I'm also wondering if it's mostly down to personal preference at this point, and all three phones are capable of handling everyday tasks with similar levels of performance.Any insights from people who have used multiple flagship phones would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in advance!","388":"\"I understand everyone's sharing their experiences, but I'd like to offer a different perspective. First, when discussing issues, it's helpful to consider whether anything could have been done to prevent them. For example, when I've broken my phone, it's usually been due to my own actions, though occasional glitches do happen.Regarding Google vs. Apple, it's important to remember that Google sells a significantly larger volume of devices, so statistically, they might have more reported issues. My personal experience with my Google Pixel 7 Pro has been overwhelmingly positive. I've had two issues, both due to my own clumsiness.  The first time, the screen suddenly turned orange. Google promptly repaired it, no questions asked.  The second time, I dropped it (without a case, unfortunately!) right after receiving it back from the first repair.  Even then, Google generously sent me a second replacement device.  Their customer service, while sometimes hard to navigate due to seemingly inexperienced staff, ultimately resolved both issues quickly and efficiently.On the other hand, I had a drastically different experience with Apple. My iPhone stopped working just two months after purchase, going into a boot loop.  It took over two years of persistent effort to get it replaced. I visited seven different Apple stores, armed with my box and documentation of all the troubleshooting steps I'd taken (though I didn't have the physical receipt on hand that day).  At one point, they even told me my phone was reported lost or stolen, despite having proof of purchase through Verizon.  Verizon later confirmed they had accidentally flagged it, and it was never on any blacklist.  Apple's behavior was frankly appalling. They treated me with suspicion, essentially accusing me of stealing my own phone, and even escorted me out of one store.  It took countless emails and phone calls, and finally connecting with the right person at Apple, to resolve the issue. While I'm grateful they eventually fixed it, the two-year ordeal was unacceptable.My point is, let's try to be constructive and work with companies like Google to address any problems.  Instead of simply criticizing, perhaps we can offer helpful feedback and solutions. All phones can experience issues, regardless of the brand.  Sometimes the problem is related to the user, and sometimes it's a manufacturing defect.  If you're consistently unhappy with a particular brand, perhaps it's time to consider switching.  Ultimately, it's about finding what works best for each individual.  And finally, a general note to all companies: customer service is crucial.  It's the face of your brand, and it needs to be better.\"","389":"Background of the purchase: I had been using an iPhone, but since my child\u2019s kindergarten activities required a recording device, I found it challenging to find a suitable DV. It seems that major companies are now focusing on smart phone recording devices. After some research, I was drawn to the Pixel 9 Pro for its 5x+ zoom lens, video boost feature, and Gemini, and I also wanted to try the latest Android system. So, I decided to go with the Pixel 9 Pro.Impressive features:1. The zoom quality up to 15x is quite good, and the Video Boost feature is stunning, perfectly meeting my needs for recording my child\u2019s kindergarten activities.2. Gemini is incredibly convenient; quick inquiries and responses from the local LLM are very efficient, and its voice recognition capability is excellent.3. I can use apps to block spam calls and texts. (Finally! \ud83d\ude2d)4. The display is detailed and vibrant, and various apps run very smoothly.5. Six months of free Google One. Gemini Advance provides me with an additional LLM service option. Sometimes the answers from gemini advance are better than GPT4o.6. Adding events and performing other tasks with Gemini Advance is very convenient.Areas for Improvement:1. First, the Bluetooth is very disappointing. I enjoy using Bluetooth earbuds while doing chores, but if I move more than 5 meters from the phone, the sound starts breaking up. In my opinion, reliable Bluetooth connectivity is a basic requirement for a smartphone, and Pixel didn\u2019t meet this standard, which is really unfortunate.2. As a regular user, I can\u2019t see much difference between 12MP and 50MP photos. Plus, you can\u2019t take continuous shots at 50MP, which is frustrating when I need to capture multiple moments quickly.3. Photos and videos can only be cast to a TV via Chromecast, not Miracast. I have a Chromecast 4K device, a 4K TV, and WiFi 6, but casting 50MP photos or 4K videos still appears blurry.4. The Recent Apps gesture (swiping up from the bottom) fails frequently. I like to close unnecessary apps, and while this gesture is similar to the iPhone\u2019s, it often seems like the Pixel is actively blocking me from accessing Recent Apps.5. Gemini\u2019s responses are often too wordy, and I typically only need brief answers. Using prompts to refine responses leads to longer voice interactions, which increases the risk of speech recognition errors.6. Fingerprint unlock occasionally fails.7. I can\u2019t remove the Google search UI at the bottom, and the screenshot and search buttons in Recent Apps are also permanent. As a regular user, I don\u2019t need frequent search access.8. The power and volume buttons are on the same side, which makes it easy to press the wrong one.9. The news recommendations on the leftmost screen of the home page can\u2019t be customized for another feature, such as frequently used app predictions. I don\u2019t like these news recommendations and can only turn them off rather than replace them with something more useful.10. There\u2019s no feature showing recommended apps based on my current context or historical usage data.Reiterating, I am just an ordinary user who doesn\u2019t enjoy gaming and only looks at my phone screen for about 30 minutes a day (while using Bluetooth headphones to listen to audio for around 2 hours). The issues I\u2019ve encountered might be due to individual device quality or possibly my lack of understanding of the proper usage methods.","390":"Switching from a Google Pixel 8 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max was a decision driven by several critical factors that significantly impacted my daily use and overall satisfaction with the Pixel device.Firstly, one of the major issues I encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro was its abysmal battery life. Despite efforts to conserve power such as using low screen resolution and disabling unnecessary features, I could barely manage 3 to 4 hours of screen-on time on 4G. This severely restricted my ability to use the phone throughout the day without needing frequent recharges.Secondly, charging the Pixel 8 Pro was a frustratingly slow process, regardless of the charging method or accessories used. Even with fast chargers, the device took an unreasonably long time to replenish its battery, adding to the inconvenience caused by its poor battery longevity.Another significant drawback was the inconsistent performance of its 4G and 5G antennas. I frequently experienced dropped calls, slow data speeds, and poor signal reception in areas where other devices showed better connectivity. This unreliable network performance greatly hindered my productivity and communication while on the go.Furthermore, the photo and video editing capabilities of the Pixel 8 Pro fell short of expectations. Basic tasks such as trimming a short video clip often took an unexpectedly long time, which was frustrating when trying to quickly edit and share content. This sluggish performance impacted my workflow and creative projects negatively.In terms of overall performance, the Pixel 8 Pro lagged behind other flagship smartphones in its class. Apps frequently stuttered, and there were noticeable delays in executing commands and multitasking. This subpar performance was particularly disappointing considering the device's positioning as a premium smartphone.Lastly, the artificial intelligence (AI) features touted by the Pixel 8 Pro did not deliver as promised. While Google's AI capabilities are renowned, I found that the practical applications and user experience fell short of the seamless integration and usefulness expected from such technologies.Given these persistent issues and frustrations with the Pixel 8 Pro, I made the decision to switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The iPhone offered superior battery life, faster charging capabilities, reliable network connectivity, and smoother overall performance. Its robust ecosystem of apps and services, coupled with intuitive software features, addressed the shortcomings I experienced with the Pixel 8 Pro.In conclusion, my transition from the Pixel 8 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro Max was driven by a need for a more reliable and efficient smartphone experience. Despite the storage capacity difference, the iPhone's performance, battery life, and ecosystem better suited my professional and personal needs, providing a significant upgrade in usability and satisfaction compared to the Pixel.(i paid same price for the 15 pro max, just got 200 gigs less)","391":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","392":"I got the IQOO 12 in the first week of Jan 2024 and I have been using it as my daily driver for a year now. The main reason I am writing this review is because in the upcoming sale the phone is selling for 42,000 INR and it\u2019s pricing is very similar to the Oneplus 13R and a lot of people don\u2019t know which phone to pick for the price.While I have not used a Oneplus 13R yet I can share my experience with the IQOO 12 because I have used the phone for over a year as my daily driver now. Hopefully this can help some people in their buying decisions.The review is going to he split up into different sections so if you want to just read about one aspect of the phone you can just read that.**Unboxing**The unboxing experience is good. Everything you need to get started is already included in the box. Things that are included in are1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The phone2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A transparent TPU case3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 120W Charging Brick4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Type-C To C cable5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 User Manual6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Warranty Card7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sim Tool8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The BMW M Motorsport Cardboard cutout thingOverall, a very solid unboxing and you get everything you need to start using the phone.**Display**The display is just amazing, with great viewing angles, colors and a high resolution this display is just a joy to use. The 6.78-inch size may be a big for some but most flagships are even bigger so ig this is not a problem for most people.The color accuracy is really good and you can do color sensitive work on this screen. The peek brightness of 3000 nits is only available on a 1% window when watching HDR content on a platform like Netflix or youtube, but with the slider the screen can do to around 800 nits and with HBM can go upto 1400 nits with makes the screen very usable even under direct sunlight.The 120 Hz refresh rate helps the display feel smooth in day to day use and the LTPO tech works amazing well with the screen going to 1Hz while idle and on the AOD.Over the display is amazing and definitely a highlight of this phone.**Build Quality**The phone feels very solid in the hand and feels very well built. The flat edges give it a slight iphone feel when holding it, but the back glass slightly curves into the housing so the phone does not dig into your hand while using it.The IP 64 rating is good and will protect it form stuff like rain and water splashes but use in a pool or anything like that is not ideal. The back glass feels nice and made well. I use a case all the time so I can\u2019t really comment on that. Also, the white \u201clegend\u201d variant, the color you see on sites like amazon and even on IQOOs own site make it seem like it back is pure white but in reality, it\u2019s a little off white which I actually prefer over pure white.Overall, the phone feels like a flagship and showing be durable for a good while.**Performance**Just as a frame of reference I had the Xiaomi 11T Pro before I got the IQOO 12 and the performance improvement was really good. The SD 888 is still a great chip and performs well to this day, but the 8 Gen 3 just makes everything feel so snappy and fluid for day-to-day use.Everything from opening apps to taking photos feels like it happens instantly and it\u2019s a massive jump of from the 888. Now if what most people want to know. How good is it for gaming? And it\u2019s amazing but I think everyone expected that considering that this is a IQOO device.Now I am not much or a mobile gamer but the games I did test run extremely well on max graphics. Games like Genshin impact ran at a solid 60FPS even after over an hr. of continuous play. Other games like PUBG, CODM and wild rift ran very well. Plus, will all the stuff that IQOO\/ VIVO have got gaming, it\u2019s just really good.Also, the temps where under control and never felt like the phone was getting too hot or unusable. The one downside I can see is the USB-C 2.0 port on the phone will not allow you to add an external display for use one for capture, so if that is important to you then keep that in mind.Overall, the phones performance is just amazing for the price. Everything from gaming to just taking pictures feels like it happens instantly.**OS**Oh boy\u2026\u2026. Funtouch OS. The amount of people that say that Funtouch OS is trash without using it is just funny to me. I will agree that the older versions of Funtouch OS where not the best but especially with Funtouch OS 14 Vivo really did step up their game.Everything in the OS feels smooth and polished. It was never laggy or slow at any point and there is a lot of customizations options. Is it perfect? No, Is it the best android OS? No, but it\u2019s a great OS that does nothing bad. With the android 15 update the OS has become more refined with better features and more AI features.I can tell you one thing but it was way better that whatever version of dogshit MIUI I was using on my 11T Pro, but Xiaomi has also improved a lot with Hyper OS so props to them as well.Overall Funtouch OS is good and it should not be the deciding factor if you where planning to buy this phone.**Cellular Connectivity**The phone supports all of the most common 5G bands and connection has been great for me. I have never had any connections issues and I have never had connection drop for no reason. The 5G speeds do depend on there you live, but for me I got around 700 Mbps connection with Jio.Overall, I don\u2019t have much to say really. The connectivity is great and works very well.**Cameras**I was surprised that the cameras where this good.The rear camera setup is a proper setup with no bs 8 MP Ultra-wide or 2 MP Macro. The specs of the rear cameras are: -50 MP, f\/1.7, 23mm (wide), 1\/1.3\", 1.2\u00b5m, multi-directional PDAF, OIS  64 MP, f\/2.6, 70mm (periscope telephoto), 1\/2.0\", PDAF, OIS, 3x optical zoom  50 MP, f\/2.0, 15mm, 119\u02da (ultrawide), AF\\*Source \u2013 GSMArenaThe main camera is very capable to capture great images during the day time. The images come out with good colors, great clarity and great detail. The low light performance is great as well but these is the down side that sometimes it does make night time shots too bright.When capturing human subjects, the skin tone is generally captured well, but sometimes it may tend to make a skin tone more red.The Ultra-wide camera has similar color sense as the main and performs very similar to the main camera.The phone can capture video 4k@60 and\u00a0[8k@30](mailto:8k@30). The 4k video from the main camera comes out with great quality with great detail, good contrast and great white balance. The stabilization is great while recording at 4k but the 8k stabilization while being good could have been better.The periscope telephoto camera is one of this phone\u2019s main highlights of the phone. With the 3x optical zoom the phone is able to capture absolutely amazing portrait shots. The advertised 100x is not the best but it does get the job done and with the help of some image processing test of a sign or billboard for far can be read decently well.Overall, the cameras did impress me. For this price you get a lot of cameras for your money.**Conclusion**For the sale price I do think that this is a real contender for the best phone under 50k. With amazing build quality, great camera and amazing performance the IQOO 12 should be in your list if you are looking to buy a phone under 50k on this sale.If you feel like I forgot to mention something or that I made a mistake please do let me know :)**Camera Samples**","393":"I am very sad and disappointed to say that after trying a ton of flagship phones in the last two years  (S24+, Oneplus 11, iPhone 15 Pro Max, Xiaomi 13T Pro, Pixel 9) the best phones are the ones you expect are the best. Its Samsung or Apple at 1st place and Google at 2nd place then Oneplus 3rd then Xiaomi and the other Chinese brands. Lets get into some further points below:Performance: The smoothest and best performing phones were the iPhone, Samsung and Oneplus. The Xiaomi had hitching frequently, overheating and other weird stuff. Pixel usually stays smooth but once pushed shows that its an inferior chip.Display: Samsung. It offers the refresh rate promised consistently regardless of brightness ahem Oneplus and Apple with excellent specs ahem Google and an actually modernly good brightness ahem Xiaomi.Speakers: iPhone and Samsung. You will only understand when you put them side by side the others sound decent as well but are humiliated when set next to these two.Ecosystem: Apple clear first place, Xiaomi and Samsung second place. Apple is the king of continuity and fluidity between devices even if Samsung and Xiaomi are making their own attempts that are just not as polished in reality or are limited due to lack of good products in other product categories (Samsung horrid laptops, Xiaomi tablets dont ever make it to my country)Battery life: Apple and Samsung. Oneplus was good but went worse after some update, Pixel was pretty mediocre all around, Xiaomi is extremely unoptimized and gets completely destroyed on 5G data. Keep in mind Xiaomi also has explicitly hidden battery health statistics and protections which I find hideous.Automations\/Smart Device Management: Samsung and Apple have automations at the operating system level which make automating tasks and managing smart devices so much easier for advanced users like me. I hated the lack of this on the other phones and I will not settle for mediocre solutions such as Tasker or rooting personally.Software: I highly underestimated this during this journey but at the end it became rule #1. If the OS and software support sucks the experience sucks. Winners are Pixel, Samsung and Apple. Pixel is a click behind due to slip ups with bugs at times but should overall be a great experience, even if a little limited for power users.Hardware: Xiaomi. This is the real shame here. If Xiaomi put equal or 90% the effort they put in sourcing hardware into developing good software with ongoing support it would have been number #1 within one financial year. The reality is that the hardware looks good on paper but runs like shit in reality. For example my 13T Pro has autofocus issues, wifi stability issues, Bluetooth is extremely bad it just disconnects all the time, one update in six months, misleading display brightness, 50% worse performance on my unit, no in-country warranty if not bought from specific shops in my country. Thats when I realized that a Samsung A55 just offers a better experience even if literally inferior in specs and I pivoted.This is just my opinion from my recent two year experiences and I currently still own only the iPhone and Samsung, however I want to inspire conversation below of how do you guys feel about all that I discussed.","394":"Hey everyone! I\u2019ve been using the Motorola Edge 50 Pro (12\/256 variant) for over a month now, and I wanted to share my thoughts. I\u2019m a normal user who values smooth, lag-free software and great photo and video quality. After a month of using it as my primary phone, here\u2019s my take on the pros and cons.Build Quality & Design- The build quality feels premium. The aluminium power and volume buttons give it a solid feel and the device looks amazing.Display- The display is sharp, with vibrant colors and good brightness levels, making it easy to use indoors and outdoors. 144hz refresh rate is smooth and hasn\u2019t stuttered once, which has been a pleasure for general usage and light gaming.Software & Performance- The software experience has been smooth and clean with no lag. Motorola\u2019s UI is close to stock Android, which I personally love for its simplicity.Battery Life & Charging- I generally charge the phone to around 80% and occasionally hit 100% (only when I really need it).The 125W fast charger is insane; it charges the phone up in no time, and I\u2019ve noticed heat during charging. But it's not concerning. Battery life is good enough for me. I don't recommend that for gamers.Sound Quality- The speakers are seriously amazing. The sound is super clear with Dolby Atmos and loud enough to fill a room. Whether I\u2019m watching videos, gaming, or just listening to music, the audio is crisp and has a nice depth to it. It really makes a difference for streaming and everyday use.. I'm loving it!Camera Quality- The camera is one of the highlights which takes amazing photos with sharp detail and balanced colors.I\u2019ve tested the video quality as well, and since the August update, the jittering issue I noticed at 30 fps is gone Portrait shots are impressive.However, after the September security update (the latest one), I noticed the telephoto camera struggles to focus at times, especially in low-light and night conditions.Connectivity- I have strong 5G signal strength in my area, and the 50 pro has kept me connected without issues. Data speeds are fast, and I haven\u2019t experienced any call drops or network problems.Pros:Great camera quality with stable video recording.Smooth, lag-free software experience.Strong 5G signal and connectivity.Excellent build quality and durable materials.Amazing sound quality.Cons:Occasional focusing issues with the telephoto camera in low-light or night conditions after the latest update. Other than that I haven\u2019t noticed any major downsides yet, but if I find anything, I\u2019ll update.","395":"Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more \"dedicated\" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one exampleAs such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses*** **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as \"pointless and gimmicky\" and \"flawed,\" with its accuracy being \"horrific\". The software is still in development for the button.* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a \"Frosty glass\" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra*** **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone\u2019s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around \u00a31,199\/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of \u00a31,249\/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL*** **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a \"pure\" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem*** **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple\u2019s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android\u2019s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google\u2019s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem\u2019s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.","396":"I recently purchased a P9PXL to replace an aging iPhone 12 Pro Max and after a week of ownership, the P9PXL is being returned. I just wanted to spread the word in case my issues were hardware\/software batch or revision related so you know what you might experience and what to look out for. It seems like it is just not finished yet, like another few months of work could have really ironed out some major wrinkles.* The battery life was very poor (5 to 5.5 hours of screen-on time), though I realize a week isn't enough to \"teach\" it my habits. Regardless, this was not impressive, I don't play games or do anything intensive. * Wireless charging was just ***broken***. I've read a ton of Pixel forum and reddit posts and such where people are complaining that they can't get the device to properly charge wirelessly, even on Google wireless chargers. Mine worked on ZERO of my wireless chargers, and exhibited all of the same symptoms as the other posters. Apparently the Pixel engineering team is aware of the issue and is working on it, with no timeline for a fix.* The reception strength was weak. At the same location my 12PM got -100dBm, the P9PXL was getting -118dBm, and it was always worse by about -20dBm. It would essentially *never* connect to 5G UW, and the speeds it did get on LTE and 5G base were notably less than the 12PM, which could also still connect to 5G UW.* Bluetooth took a very long time to both pair and reconnect. Smart lights, headphones, etc would take 10-15 seconds or more to connect. * ***DELAYED GMAIL NOTIFICATIONS***: This is the worst offender, and apparently as I've learned, a Pixel staple issue. I depend on quick email correspondence for work and I was not getting push notifications when new emails came in. Sometimes I'd get them... 45 minutes after I'd received them. The forums are filled with this issue for *multiple generations of Pixel phones*, but they have no expected resolution as it may be due to Android's \"Doze\" idle power management.If none of these issues are of particular note to you, or if you want to be along for the ride as they fix them, it's a nice phone otherwise. Great screen, great haptics, loud speaker, etc. And maybe I got an early batch defective unit and you won't have these issues at all. I just figured it'd be nice to give a warning before you put down $1200 for something that is essentially a \"work in progress.\"","397":"My iPhone 12 Pro Max has served me well and will likely serve a family member well for a while after I choose a successor, but I'm interested in hearing real users opinions on the matter. **Skip my personal context below if you're not interested and just want to weigh in**, but I am specifically interested in hearing if Android has improved in stability since 2020 when I last owned an Android device. Personal anecdotes welcome. This would effect whether or not I'm willing to try going back to Android, and if the Pixel is the right choice to do so.*Here are some of my current thoughts\/context going into this:** *The main reason I tried the iPhone in the first place was because of how terribly unstable my Galaxy S9 and OnePlus 7T were before it. I'd owned 6 or 7 Android phones before the 12PM. Instead of unlocking bootloaders and finding ROMs to see if I could fix the phones' issues myself, I just got sick of it and wanted a phone that worked out of the box.** *I don't own many other Apple \"ecosystem\" devices, so that isn't really a big deal to me concerning switching OS's.** *Having seen it first hand, app developers really do favor iOS. The apps are sometimes night-and-day better for iPhone users.** *I don't play mobile games, so peak performance isn't much of an issue for me but I do recognize that it does help extend the device's lifespan into the future.** *The notifications on iOS are* ***atrocious***. Android nailed the swipe-down notification list and groupings a while ago, and Apple is too stubborn to steal it as of yet. I wish they would.* *You \\*still\\* can't set individual notification tones for different apps in iOS. This has bugged me for years.** *Battery life is important to me. When I travel, I don't always have a battery or wall plug available. This makes the 16 Pro Max especially appealing.** *Stable Bluetooth connectivity is very important to me.** *MagSafe is actually fantastic, but I think I can get a MagSafe compatible case for most well known Android devices.** *Having a way to monitor battery health is important to me. I have 88% battery health on my 12PM after 4 years of use. It's important here since the 12PM only had a \\~3600mAh battery to start with.*","398":"Here are the specs for the king of this category:ProcessorSnapdragon\u00ae 695CPU: Octa-core CPU, up to 2.2GHzGPU: Qualcomm\u00ae Adreno\u2122 619Storage and RAM6+64\/6+128\/8+128GBLPDDR4X + UFS2.2Expandable storage up to 1TB*Available storage and RAM are less than the total memory due to storage of the operating system and software pre-installed on the device.DimensionsHeight: 164.19mmWidth: 76.1mmThickness: 8.12mmWeight: 202gDisplay6.67\" FHD+ AMOLED DotDisplayRefresh rate: Up to 120HzBrightness: HBM 700 nits (typ), 1200 nits peak brightness (typ)Contrast ratio: 4,500,000:1Resolution: 2400 x 1080DCI-P3 wide color gamut395 ppiSunlight displayReading mode 3.0Rear Camera108MP wide cameraf\/1.90.7\u03bcm, 9-in-1 binning into one large 2.1\u03bcm pixel1\/1.52\u201d sensor size8MP ultra-wide cameraf\/2.2FOV 118\u00b02MP macro sensorf\/2.4Rear camera video recording1080p 1920x1080 | 30fps720p 1280x720 | 30fpsFront Camera16MP front cameraf\/2.4Front camera video recording1080p 1920x1080 | 30fps720p 1280x720 | 30fpsBattery & Charging5000mAh (typ)67W turbo charging67W in-box chargerUSB-CSecuritySide fingerprint sensorAI Face UnlockNFCAvailability varies between market* Functions may vary in some markets.*Functions may vary in some markets.Network & ConnectivityDual SIM + microSD2G: GSM: 850 900 1800 1900MHz3G: WCDMA:1\/2\/4\/5\/8\/194G: LTE FDD:1\/2\/3\/4\/5\/7\/8\/12\/13\/17\/18\/19\/20\/26\/28\/32\/664G: LTE TDD:38\/40\/41 \uff08B41 2535-2655MHz\uff095G: n1\/3\/5\/7\/8\/20\/28\/38\/40\/41\/66\/77\/78Bluetooth 5.2Wi-Fi Protocol: 802.11a\/b\/g\/n\/ac\/axNavigation & PositioningGPS: L1 \uff5cGLONASS: G1 | Compass: B1AudioDual speakers3.5mm headphone jackHi-Res Audio certificationSensorsProximity sensor | Ambient light sensor | Accelerometer | Electronic compass | IR blaster \uff5cGyroscopeOperating SystemMIUI 13, based on Android 11Package ContentsRedmi Note 11 Pro 5G \/ Adapter \/ USB Type-C Cable \/ SIM Eject Tool \/ Protective Case \/Quick Start Guide \/ Warranty Card","399":"I assume its the same on any screen, but in the context of smartphones, how does PPI work?I have a Galaxy S7, which looks very nice, even if the screen is small. I broke the glass, and im looking for a replacement. The S10 looks good enough, similar size with bigger screen. Okay great.Then I realized something: The S7 has higher PPI. In fact the S7 has higher PPI than any other Galaxy after it.I considered the s10e, but it has an obscene amount of loss of PPI. Some may claim it's not noticeable, but I use smartphones to watch movies at night on a plane travel for instance, or in train. It works fine on pitch dark. So if I buy a phone with lower PPI, im worried the pixels will be noticeable.So my question is: Is PPI a value that describes pixel density, and this helps you give you an idea of how much of a screen door effect you may see, no matter how big the screen is?Im asking because the S10, while having a bit lower PPI, seems to be on that 550+ range, compared to the s10e, where there is a big drop to 400 range. For reference:S7:Type: Super AMOLED Size: 5.1 inches, 71.5 cm2 (\\~72.1% screen-to-body ratio) Resolution: 1440 x 2560 pixels, 16:9 ratio (\\~577 ppi density)S10e:Type: Dynamic AMOLED, HDR10+ Size: 5.8 inches, 82.8 cm2 (\\~83.3% screen-to-body ratio) Resolution: 1080 x 2280 pixels, 19:9 ratio (\\~438 ppi density)S10:Type: Dynamic AMOLED, HDR10+  Size: 6.1 inches, 93.2 cm^(2) (\\~88.3% screen-to-body ratio) Resolution: 1440 x 3040 pixels, 19:9 ratio (\\~550 ppi density)  Given those options, would the S10 be better than repair the S7, because it's too old anyway, and better than the s10e, because of the big drop in PPI?And if the S10 has similar PPI, the fact that the screen is bigger, is not a factor, since the PPI is similar? Or is the PPI not a final value to determine screen door effect, and you require another value deriver from some sort of a ratio between screen size and PPI? or is the PPI an absolute number?For example:Given the same VR headset (same lenses, and sitting distance from the phone to the screen, etc)Phone 1: 5.1 inches screen, 550 PPIPhone 2: 6.1 inches screen, 550 PPIIs it technically the same pixel density, thus not noticeable difference in possible screen door effect between phones? If yes, then, I can trust the PPI values to get an idea, and given the good experience using the S7 for media usage in VR, then since it is a similar value, im assuming it will be good enough. I may lose a small amount in crispyness, opefully not noticeable, but get a noticeable increase in FOV due bigger screen?  Please let me understand this. And no im not interested in buying GearVR, or buying Oculus whatever etc, I just need a smartphone and a generic headset, works fine for this use case. I also don't need higher performance than S7 Exynos tbh, works smooth for all tasks, battery is still pretty good and lasts for a day at my amount of usage. If I didn't break the glass from a drop I would still keep it.","400":"My current phone is a iPhone 11, its showing its age in the battery and speed department (CPU and RAM not sufficient to keep more than one app in memory) and I have never liked its size - was previously using an iPhone 7 which I loved and that was closer in size to the Nexus 5X which I also liked.

Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","402":"Since the iphone 16e launch today, that made apples already poor image look even worse. then i thought about it, are there even any good phone brands in 2024?Apples all over the place, the iphone 16 lineup is awful, the 16e they just announced is awful, apple intelligence is awful, and half the features dont even come to the older phones (like the 16e getting visual intelligence via action button, but not the 15 pros which have the same button). The base models still have 60hz, and the 120hz pro models are limited by ios to run at 80hz max. The only saving grace is that ipads, macs, and airpods are so good compared to the competition. Also if you are in the united states like me, have fun using anything but iphone. Having any android is basically begging to get made fun of.Samsung cant seem to get an update out for the life of them. It looks like oneui 7 isnt even coming out for the s24 series until may at the earliest. if you are on an s23 device then you can just forget it, oneui 7 probably isnt coming this year for you. Good hardware but the software is just okay. The camera still struggles to beat the iphones despite having much better hardware. The bloatware and having a samsung\/google variant of each app is just plain stupid and annoying. Basaically all they do is try to copy apple now a daysPixels just seem like a rip offs overall. Anything a pixel can do, a samsung or any other android can do better. Not to mention the garbage specs on pixel devices while costing just as much as iphones and samsungs. Pixels ui is pretty mid aswell. The main upside is that you are prioritized by google and get all the updates first. lets not forget to mention the pixel fold which is easily the worst fold on the market. The rest of googles ecosystem is practically non existent. They have a tablet which is not good, chromebooks which are also bad, and pixel buds which i doubt anyone is using. pixel watch is good atleast from what ive heard.Oneplus seems like the most reliable out of them all. The specs are better than every other flagship from the main brands while being cheaper. The only issue is that the camera does not seem up to par, and the software is not as feature rich as oneui\/ios. Also app optomization is worse than the 3 listed aboveChinese brands:I cannot speak for them as I live in the USA where they are banned. They seem pretty good, but like I said I cant really compare them lol.","403":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading!https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6os3l9l2altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6fcdf4dd6f4d1aafd4fdccccb75bdca7235f407","404":"Hey folks, long-time Android user here with some thoughts I need to get off my chest. I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","405":"I\u2019ve been an Android user for years and am thinking about switching to iOS (from my trusty 1+ 6T)(leaning toward an iPhone 13 Pro), but I have this nagging fear about the little day-to-day stuff. From what I\u2019ve researched, iOS seems conceptually better for my needs (reliable performance, longevity, and smooth updates), but I\u2019m worried about losing some conveniences I\u2019ve gotten used to on Android.Here are my specific concerns:Voice control while driving: On Android, I can reliably control most things with my voice (Google Assistant), especially while driving. Can Siri handle stuff like sending texts, navigating to specific locations in Google Maps, or switching Spotify playlists? I drive a lot, and hands-free control is a must.No fingerprint unlock: I use fingerprint unlock daily, and it\u2019s especially useful when I\u2019m driving. I\u2019ve heard Face ID works well, but will I miss having a fingerprint scanner for things like quick unlocks in the car?Smart Unlock with Bluetooth devices: On Android, I love that my phone stays unlocked when connected to my Fitbit or car Bluetooth. Does iOS have anything like this?Default apps: If someone sends me a link, I want it to open in Google Maps or Chrome instead of Apple Maps or Safari. I\u2019ve heard iOS forces you to use Apple\u2019s apps for certain things, and I worry this will be frustrating when I\u2019m on the go.These might seem silly, but they\u2019re the things I do every single day, and I worry about how much I\u2019ll miss them. Am I overthinking this? Are these real problems when switching to iOS, or are they easy to work around?Would love to hear from anyone who made the switch and how you handled these kinds of concerns! Thanks!","406":"**Opening Disclaimer:** I'm not looking for some all-out Android vs iOS warfare here. I picked this non-brand specific sub for some advice on an even playing field. Strong opinions are fine but please explain them openly, this is not a thread for arguments.**My question:**Now, I've generally had android since SmartPhones were a thing (with the exception of the iPhone 4, that was the only iPhone I ever owned). Over the last decade or two I've gone through OnePlus phones, then was on Samsung for a few generations, and I've been rocking Pixels since the 6 Pro.My main machine I use is a beasty self-built Windows 11 PC, but my laptop is a MBA and my tablet is an iPad Pro.Now for a lot of the last 2 decades, I've been staunchly team Android, and would never have considered an iPhone.However, more recently I've needed to start moving to systems which just work as smoothly and easily as possible, and I've had to care less about overall control and flexibility.There's a variety of things I use which are much better integrated with iOS than Android and with a lot of stuff going on at the moment, I feel slightly better moving some of my life away from an advertising agency.So currently I have a Pixel 9 Pro (and yes, I know it's brand new), but I'm considering selling and buying an iPhone 16 Pro. Now this would be a HUGE move, as it would mean I'd also have to sell my Pixel Watch 3 in exchange for an Apple Watch.Now I know even for people who have generally wanted to switch from Android to iOS or vice versa, a lot of the time, being so intrenched in the ecosystem is what makes the switch so hard, but the way I'm feeling right now, it's very much now or never.Now there are a few features or integrations that I rely on heavily so want to confirm that they'd still be an option for me if I did switch:* I use Google Tasks religiously. A big part of this is MANY times a day, I press a button on my Pixel watch to activate Google Assistant and just say \"remind me to do X in 2 hours\", or \"remind me X at 8am every Tuesday\". And it'll set those reminders that will be both added as tick boxes in Google tasks, and that will notify me with a reminder at the time and day I requested. Now I know it won't do this with Google Tasks specifically, but is this functionality all there with iOS and an apple watch? I'd also need these lists to be accessible from a Windows computer (even if via a browser).* I'm presuming there's some way of transferring all of my 'Authenticator' 2FA app links to whatever Apple's equivalent is?* Whilst I want to move a lot of my stuff away from Google if I can, I use Google Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail heavily. Depending on the migration and cost implications I'd maybe be tempted to move them, but that would be down the line and I wonder how well they integrate with iOS (in terms of general google Drive usage, and automatically uploading photos taken on an iPhone to Google Photos).* Circle to search. I know this itself isn't in iOS, but something that allows me to select text anywhere on the phone (even if it's in an image) and either translate it or search for it online.* My house has a lot of automations and much of that is controlled with Google Home via Google Nests, will I lose any functionality not having an Android phone?* Finally, whilst it's a bit hit or miss on Android anyway, does iOS with the newly released Apple Intelligence, have some sort of AI web page summary feature?I know this is a lot to take on board but really my question is, how would I find moving from Android on a Pixel 9 Pro, to iOS on an iPhone 16 Pro, and is there anything in particular I'd miss?","407":"Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more \"dedicated\" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one exampleAs such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses*** **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as \"pointless and gimmicky\" and \"flawed,\" with its accuracy being \"horrific\". The software is still in development for the button.* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a \"Frosty glass\" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra*** **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone\u2019s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around \u00a31,199\/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of \u00a31,249\/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL*** **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a \"pure\" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem*** **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple\u2019s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android\u2019s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google\u2019s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem\u2019s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.","408":"I\u00a0am reaching out to request your help in bringing attention to two important security features that Google should implement in its Pixel line of phones:1. **Require a PIN to power off the phone or access the power menu from the lock screen.**2. **Require a PIN or fingerprint to access quick toggles from the lock screen.**I recently bought a used Pixel 6a for its camera and software, but unfortunately, it was stolen while I was on a bus. The thief initially answered my call, but then turned the phone off, making it impossible to track. The phone had an eSIM, which cannot be removed unless the device is unlocked, yet the thief could easily power it down from the lock screen. If these features had been implemented, there would have been a higher chance of recovering my phone.While Google is introducing offline finding features, they currently do not match the effectiveness of Apple\u2019s solutions. These theft prevention measures lose their impact if a thief can simply power off the phone.Other brands like Samsung, Motorola, and OnePlus already have such security options, which, when combined with an eSIM, make the phones much harder to steal. While some may argue that these features won\u2019t entirely prevent theft, they would greatly increase the chances of catching the culprits.The Indian government's website for reporting stolen phones is a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s ineffective if the phone is turned off, shipped abroad, and sold. Though some third-party apps offer similar protection features , their reliability and security are questionable.As active google phone users, your support in raising awareness on this issue could push Google to prioritize these simple yet crucial features, which would greatly improve security for Pixel users.Thank you for considering this request.","409":"Hello,I've been an Android user for 10 years. Currently, I have a Pixel 8 and a Pixel Watch 2. Let me highlight the points that are annoying me about Android and why I'm considering moving to iOS. I've had a few Samsungs in the past, but I don't like the bloatware and duplication of apps. I really like the vanilla experience and don't want to move to another brand within Android. For me, the only choices are Apple and Google.**Android cons:*** **Unlock:** Face Unlock is very convenient, but only when you are in a well-lit space. I have the PW2 configured to unlock using proximity, but sometimes it doesn't unlock and asks for the PIN. Additionally, when it does unlock with the PW2, the watch vibrates (and you cannot deactivate it). I think FaceID would be more convenient, but the only phones in Android that have it are from Honor, and as I said, I don't want to use any brand other than Google. Also, tilt to wake is a bit inconsistent for me.* **Watch:** Some features are behind a paywall. Recently, I went on a two-week trip and had inconsistent battery life. For instance, on two days, without any apparent reason, the battery drained in only 12 hours, while it usually lasts for 32 hours (I don't have AOD enabled). No permanent ECG reading. I think the Apple Watch offers a more polished experience. Tilt to wake is also a bit inconsistent.* **Battery:** It leaves much to be desired, even though I'm using the Android 15 beta.* **Lack of polishing in some apps:** The App Store has stricter rules than Android.* **Lack of design coherence.****iOS cons:*** Lack of a good voice assistant* Notifications are not as good as Android (but they seem to be improved in iOS 18)* The stock keyboard (and even Swiftkey or Gboard) is far behind compared to Android Gboard* No Revanced (I use Revanced for Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram)* No split screen* No background tasks* No Google Discover* No clipboard manager* No universal back gesture (and also, not having back gesture from both sides)* No possibility to drop down the notifications from the bottom like I have in Android (for one-handed usage)I'm also a heavy Google user (I have a lot of IoT peripherals in my home managed by Google Home: Nest Camera, Chromecast...). So why am I considering this? I have a MacBook Pro as a work computer, an iPad, and a Mac Mini as personal computers, and the integration is good (e.g., shared clipboard, which is even better in iOS 18). I'm a bit tired of the issues I mentioned in Android, but on the other hand, I see a lot of cons with iOS. So, I don't know what to do, and I would like to hear your thoughts and suggestions.","410":"Thank you anyone that can offer good feedback. I'll try to keep this short. Right now own a paid off iPhone 13 Pro. This is what keeps me on iPhones in particular order. I'm not on the Apple locked-in ecosystem. I wish Android phones supported call recording and had their own secure FaceID.  I would switch immediately if it did. 1. Phone call recording. I use this all the time. Really helpful when dealing with customer service. Since Google made it harder to record phone calls and now Apple will natively support call recording on iOS 18 coming out next month. I do not know of any Android third party call recorder apps that work 100% off the time. 2. FaceID on iPhones. Feels a lot more secure than using fingerprint on Samsung phones. I know Samsung already has it but can't login to more secure apps such as banking apps. Also do not want someone logging into my phone with a fingerprint  if I'm ever unconscious. You never know LOL. 3. The qualify of the apps on iPhones are done really well. Just feels better quality compared to the Android apps. I could be wrong here. Android apps might have improved over the years. It has been years since I've used an Android phone. I really hate it when an app you like are only on iPhones and not on Android phones. I have heard it's easier to build apps for iPhones compared to Android based phones. Now why do I want to switch to an Android phone such as the Samsung Galaxy phones? Here are the reasons in particular order. 1. Latest and greatest cellular modem. Next one from Qualcomm is the X80. I hate using a business's free Wi-Fi. Really insecure. Also using a VPN will slow down my speed. iPhone will stay with X75 on iPhone 16. It will use X80 on iPhone 17. Samsung Galaxy S25 will use X80 modem. 2. Miss using the word runner on the Kindle app. Sadly Apple and Amazon have disagreements and Apple chose not to support this on their iPhones. Some books are great with word runner. Reading the book faster. 3. 100% real browsers on Android and not just Safari engine underneath with all the browsers on the iPhone. 4. Keyboards are so much better on Android based phones. I really hate it on iPhones. I wished iPhones would always show the number row. Also, really hate typing in a log in and it reverts back to the default keyboard and can't switch keyboards at that moment. Voice typing is also much better on Android. 5. Notifications are much better done on Android phones. 6. I have seen various YouTube videos about Android phones and it feels so much faster to get things done on it compared to an iPhone. 7. I really like the customization on Android phones. What would be great if a company took the best features of an iPhone and of Android and put it on one phone. I am not sure what to do. I am in the USA if that helps. Thanks.

If all you care about is calling and or texting your peers, this phone is the right choice for you. Because this is what the phone is best at.This phone is not trying to achieve any milestones, it is designed for the absolute basics.I have tried to watch YouTube on this thing via Grayjay and the screen is average as you'd likely suspect when you consider the price is around $180 CAD (likely a few dollars American... joking, it would be around $120).What I will say about this phone that stands out to me for the price is the stereo speakers are actually great, they sound fine. If you are lets say an \"audio guy\/gal\" that this phone is also for you. If you don't care at all about how the screen looks and all you're after is audio, 3 thumbs up from me for this phone.Also, the Moto comes with a headphone jack, if this is of concern to you. Personally, I've been experimenting with the Moto and I find the android driver sounds like shit, I plugged my USB-C to headphone jack adapter in this phone and the difference is night and day. Which is another subject I wanna emphasize. If you PAY for USB Audio Player Pro from the Play store (I can't vouch for any other paid player, I got the aforementioned) and you play your audio files through the USB port, they will sound amazing.The only issue I've run into thus far with this phone but bothers me enough to point it out is while on calls I have noticed that if I remove the Moto from my ear to look at the screen my ear is enough \"touch\" to make the screen do things, like enter the Notes menu and the \"fix\" for this is when I put the Moto to my ear I manually press the power button to turn the screen off so there's no accidental touches.If you wanna know more \/ learn more because I left out something you're curious about.

I\u2019ve been using the Motorola Edge 50 Pro (12\/256 variant) for over a month now, and I wanted to share my thoughts. I\u2019m a normal user who values smooth, lag-free software and great photo and video quality. After a month of using it as my primary phone, here\u2019s my take on the pros and cons.Build Quality & Design- The build quality feels premium. The aluminium power and volume buttons give it a solid feel and the device looks amazing.Display- The display is sharp, with vibrant colors and good brightness levels, making it easy to use indoors and outdoors. 144hz refresh rate is smooth and hasn\u2019t stuttered once, which has been a pleasure for general usage and light gaming.Software & Performance- The software experience has been smooth and clean with no lag. Motorola\u2019s UI is close to stock Android, which I personally love for its simplicity.Battery Life & Charging- I generally charge the phone to around 80% and occasionally hit 100% (only when I really need it).The 125W fast charger is insane; it charges the phone up in no time, and I\u2019ve noticed heat during charging. But it's not concerning. Battery life is good enough for me. I don't recommend that for gamers.Sound Quality- The speakers are seriously amazing. The sound is super clear with Dolby Atmos and loud enough to fill a room. Whether I\u2019m watching videos, gaming, or just listening to music, the audio is crisp and has a nice depth to it. It really makes a difference for streaming and everyday use.. I'm loving it!Camera Quality- The camera is one of the highlights which takes amazing photos with sharp detail and balanced colors.I\u2019ve tested the video quality as well, and since the August update, the jittering issue I noticed at 30 fps is gone Portrait shots are impressive.However, after the September security update (the latest one), I noticed the telephoto camera struggles to focus at times, especially in low-light and night conditions.Connectivity- I have strong 5G signal strength in my area, and the 50 pro has kept me connected without issues. Data speeds are fast, and I haven\u2019t experienced any call drops or network problems.Pros:Great camera quality with stable video recording.Smooth, lag-free software experience.Strong 5G signal and connectivity.Excellent build quality and durable materials.Amazing sound quality.Cons:Occasional focusing issues with the telephoto camera in low-light or night conditions after the latest update. Other than that I haven\u2019t noticed any major downsides yet, but if I find anything, I\u2019ll update.","414":"Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more \"dedicated\" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge.

The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple\u2019s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android\u2019s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google\u2019s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem\u2019s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.","415":"My a52s which has been pretty reliable and fine is in need of an upgrade. Its sadly becoming a bit sluggish (ok quite sluggish at times and it doesnt help that i have a lot of chrome tabs), it has issues finding the door opener bluetooth at my local gym at times when im already using bt with headset+talking on phone, the battery is getting a bit meh (again doesnt help that i use vpn) and again sluggish. Sometimes i have to restart apps\/phone and the compass when using google maps has decided to be 90 degrees of half the time.i dont game on the phone, all i pretty much use it for is reddit, browsing, spotify, snapchat, datingapps, some light apps and occassional youtube.I was perfectly okay with the a52s camera (which isnt great) as Im still not an instagram influencer. I have no need for an audio jack as im perfectly fine with bluetooth. Im pretty happy with the size though I could accept a smaller phone . Good battery is wanted. Id prefer nice screen especially one that has noticeably higher brightness than the a52s as I cant read it on very sunny days. And something snappier than the a52s. Prefer it also to last \\~3 years.With black friday going on here in Norway there are multiple phones I could go for.Xiaomi 14T 256GB - 590 eurosPixel 8a 128gb - 390 eurosPixel 8 128gb - 490 eurosPixel 8 pro 128gb - 590 eurosXperia 10 vi - 290 eurosOneplus nord 4 256gb - 390 eurosXiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G 256GB - 240 eurosXiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G 512GB - 440 eurosSamsung Galaxy s23 128gb (base model) - 540 eurosNothing 2a 12gb ram 256gb - 480 eurosOnePlus 12r - 680 euros (Could stretch to this if necessary)So what would be the optimal phone(s) price\/performance ratio here for what I want.   Whatever phone im getting im gonna use a wallet case as im a bit of a dropper (adhd fueled absent-mindedness) but id still prefer that the display isnt fragile as f.Thanks and have a great weekend guys.","416":"TitleWhenever I record a video with the Camera app, the microphone receives beeping and other harsh noises for some odd reason and it's overpowering the sound that I'm supposed to record. I managed to deduce the problem that the microphone is broken ONLY when I use it when recording videos since the Voice Recorder app and the voice recorder on Telegram, Messenger, and Instagram are functional. This hasn\u2019t always been the case as this is a relatively new phone (around half a year old) and managed to record videos with no audio issue in the past. It seems that the problem has manifested only recently sometime before I made the recent phone update.I am also certain that this problem also extends to phone calls or calls over Messenger, which made me need to use Bluetooth earphones.**Methods that I have tried but failed**:1. Turning it on and off again2. Updating my phone3. Run on Safe Mode4. Resetting all settingsI have stopped short at doing a factory reset but I might have it fixed to an authorized agent since it\u2019s still under warranty. I\u2019m trying to see if this is still a software or hardware problem.**Oddities**:The camera can take a video and record audio properly on the Telegram app, but it does not work on Instagram and Snapchat  ","417":"Best match for posting my questions I found, hoping someone can give me some insight.For long I\u2019ve been really annoyed about battery life, sluggish performance and lacking camera capabilities in my old Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It\u2019s been a perfect phone for me for a long time, but having to charge it 2-4 times per day with regular use alongside with a now cracked camera glass which introduced smudgy photos made me take the decision. I got a new phone, and it was a bold move to iOS and the new iPhone 14 pro. I knew what to expect regarding battery life, smooth performance, Face ID and camera setup.After changing phones, which was not super smooth (lost 90% of text messages etc, but I\u2019m fine with it), everything seemed fantastic at first.Now I\u2019ve had the new phone for almost two months and there are some really really disappointing things that keep annoying me on a daily basis:- The touch screen is a lot less precise then my old phone, I keep having to zoom in websites to be able to hit correctly. And I do not really have big fingers. I\u2019ve had no issues with this on my Note 8 and I hit everything I tried first attempt most times. With the iPhone it won\u2019t try and hit anything unless I zoom. For me this seems like something basic for a smartphone and it\u2019s really starting to get on my nerves.- Playing some media\/app music from videos and such tend to drop out every now and then. The solution is to try again from scratch, it may or may not work. Perhaps it\u2019s an app related issue more than iOS, I don\u2019t know.- While in a car I cannot find an option for choosing audio output to not be the car, while still have Bluetooth connected to the car. This audio source output selection seems available when in a call, but not in general use? Maybe I\u2019ve not figure it out.- At random times the phone get seriously hot where I expect the processor to be. It\u2019s uncomfortable to the touch and I usually restart the phone to fix it. This happens with lights useage(scrolling webpages of social media, nothing extra open or draining background apps). Perhaps it\u2019s an issue with the recent processor? I have not contacted the dealership about it yet, it doesn\u2019t occur every day.Other than that I am very impressed with the video quality, but actually a bit disappointed about the pictures, comparing latest new phones, where it seems other manufacturers are now producing more pleasing pictures. One of the reasons I chose to pickup and iPhone for was the great pictures it produced. They are still great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it seems not as good as the most recent competitors.Things that I DO love are the smoothness, battery life, Face ID and to a great extent the camera setup.I know it\u2019s hard to get all bells and whistles, but it seems some of the issues are unnecessary or lacking in 2022\/2023.Thoughts?( I regret sometimes that I did not pickup the Pixel 7 pro instead..)","418":"**One Plus (2017 - Oxygen OS 10.3.9) Vs. iPhone Plus 8 (2016 - iOS 14.4.2)** This is the feedback of **my experience** after using One Plus 6 for one month. I will try to highlight the strong (+) and less strong (-) points of One Plus:**Migration:**\\- No backup capabilities from my iOS apps to my One Plus device unlike iOS.&#x200B;**Battery:**\\+  Charges faster (although it requires a special cable);\\+  Last longer.&#x200B;**Screen:**\\+  Larger screen (no bezels);\\+  Bigger resolution;\\+  You can configure shortcuts to turn the lantern on among others;\\- No force touch.&#x200B;**Store:**\\+ You can download any APK from anywhere so you can have things like a PS1 emulator, although you have to be careful with your sources.&#x200B;**Unlocking the screen:**\\-  You always need to pick you your phone in order to unlock it;-  If the light is low (which was the case most of the time for me), face id doesn\u2019t work. If I need to pick up the phone in order to unlock it (since touch id is on the back), I personally prefer to have a smaller screen and the touch screen on the front.&#x200B;**Gestures:**\\-  Hiding the keyboard gesture should be from top to bottom but instead it relies on the \u201cgoing back\u201d gesture;\\-  Going back and going forward gestures take you out of the app:\\- This is especially annoying when trying to grab discord room pane since you go out of the app often.&#x200B;**Photo camera**:\\+ Better resolution;\\-  No live photos;\\-  No QR code Native reader;\\-  No measuring tape capabilities (lacks AR).&#x200B;**Definitions:**\\- When I want to disable something like the dictionary it doesn\u2019t work immediately - in order to deactivate the dictionary you need to do it in 3 different places;\\- Locating the keyboard definitions is also a challenge, to see this you can simply search \u201ckeyboard\u201d and you will get 5+ different options instead of one place with everything.&#x200B;**Night mode:**\\- Night mode is full black and not dark tones. This makes some options less easy to locate.&#x200B;**Brightness:**\\-  Since I changed to iOS I never had issues seeing my screen but on One Plus this happened more than 5 times during my 30 days experience. The automatic brightness mechanism needs to be reviewed;\\-  Because of this I was forced to change to manual adjusting which was even worse, since I couldn\u2019t see anything on my screen and you need to pull down the quick access pane twice and move a really small bar in order to see. Doing this without seeing the screen is no easy task (this is especially true when you are outside).**Notifications:**On iOS, when I receive notifications they are present on my locked screen until I unlock it. When I unlock it and lock it again, my locked screen gets automatically cleaned and it will only show new notifications. This leads me to my first point here:\\-  No notification center;\\-  No notification segregation: If you get a message on an IM app and you didn\u2019t read a previous message from a different chat you get notified with all texts from that app(on iOS you get 1 notification per message);\\-  You can\u2019t read more than 1 notification at once if your screen is locked:\\- You get the message \u201c2 new notifications from *app*\u201d;\\-  Turning off the \u201cprivate notifications\u201d isn\u2019t done in only one place either and even that doesn\u2019t solve the problem on the previous topic;\\-  The char cap for the notifications is too short;\\-  You get notifications when you take a screenshot;\\-  I get notifications when I download an image;\\-  I get around 3 weather notifications per day;\\-  If you search for a football team **once** on google, be prepared to get notified every time that team starts to play, there\u2019s a goal, the squad is announced, etc;\\-  Sticky notifications should not be a thing:\\-> I know that I have an update, do I really need to see this notification until I update? I find this too intrusive;\\-> I know that my battery is dying, I don\u2019t need that glued on my screen;\\-  The light color for charging is the same as the new notification light, which mislead me a few times;\\-  If you have a sticky notification the blue light also lights up after a while which makes it useless;\\-  You only have small symbols on icons when you have notifications while on iOS you have numbers: I prefer to have numbers and this is possible to do on this phone but not natively.On iOS, you can read full conversations without even unlocking the screen and you can disable this at any time if you don\u2019t like it.You can also decide that you want to receive notifications with work emails but you don\u2019t actually want to receive a notification for it. On iOS it\u2019s possible to have that notification stored on the notification center only and check it anytime.Another good example for this is my duolingo app: I want to do my daily exercise but I don\u2019t want to forget it. On One Plus I\u2019m forced to delete the app since I don\u2019t want to see a green row every time I\u2019m checking other notifications - this made me lose some training days. On iOS, I simply have it on the notification center.&#x200B;**Gaming mode:**\\- Gaming mode activates with a big pop up and on wrong apps: This is especially annoying when you are trying to check a match result and the pop up is blocking the score for some seconds and you have to stare at it while you wait.&#x200B;**Clipboard:**\\+ You can copy full paragraphs of text by pressing the text;\\- You can\u2019t copy full images to the clipboard: you have to download them, (get the notification while you\u2019re at it) and then send it as an attachment.&#x200B;**Chat preview:**\\- This is impossible to do on One Plus. You get a notification (that gets cut by the char cap) and you are forced to open the chat to read the conversation - on iOS, you can press a bit harder on the chat and you can see everything without anyone knowing.&#x200B;**Apps management:**\\- I got the notification \u201capp is consuming too much battery\u201d or \u201c*app* is running in background\u201d. Apps should be stopped when they aren\u2019t running.&#x200B;**Apps:**This point is not related with android directly but there were some apps were the experience was not as good as on iOS:\\- Forza: Football app, issues with gaming mode already mentioned;\\- Duolingo: You can\u2019t move words within a sentence, if you miss something in the beginning you have to re-write the whole sentence instead of just moving the word to the correct place;\\- WhatsApp: if you mute one chat you still receive notifications.**Misc:**\\-  Do not disturb and hot colors are the same option;\\-  Phone light, even with hot colors, is stronger than iOS which is worse for scrolling at bed;\\-  You can\u2019t remove gmail without root access;\\-  No native sleep timer feature:\\-> If you want to put a video on youtube with relaxing sounds and turn it off after 45 minutes, you can\u2019t - you can achieve this with spotify but hearing relaxing sounds or lo-fi music on Spotify will mess up your daily mixes;\\- Forza: Football app, issues with gaming mode already mentioned;\\- Duolingo: You can\u2019t move words within a sentence, if you miss something in the beginning you have to re-write the whole sentence instead of just moving the word to the correct place;\\- WhatsApp: if you mute one chat you still receive notifications;\\-  Keyboard has too many options visible;\\-  Native keyboard shows too many things when you select one emoji;\\-  No scroll feature for emojis;\\-  Search feature for emojis rarely works: On iOS I simply type \u201cfire\u201d and I get the emoji as a suggestion, this only works with some emojis on OnePlus.\\*\\*Conclusion:\\*\\*All in all it\u2019s a good phone but it lacks tons of quality of life improvements that iOS gave me throughout the years. The motto of Android is \u201cyou can do everything\u201d but I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not possible to remove gmail. You can remove mail - and most of native apps - on iOS. You can root your phone, install custom roms and do everything with your phone but, in my opinion, I would rather do this on a tablet or a raspberry pi.I look at a phone as an assistant and for that objective I prefer something that \u201csimply works\u201d instead of having to configure everything. I would also like to give an honorable mention to Apple ecosystem which lets me use AirPods and answer phone calls from my Macbook.&#x200B;**Disclaimer:** As I stated previously, I'm an iPhone user so there are some things that I might be wrong because I wasn't able to achieve the objective I was hoping for, this is especially true on the misc section.**TL;DR:** iPhone user likes iOS more than Android and believe iOS has more quality of life features. Might be wrong and feedback is appreciated.","419":"Hello.I'd like to purchase a smartphone(android) for the first time as I've been using a very old and slow Windows phone for the past few years.What I care about most are the specs as I intend to play a few games on it and I like having a smooth experience with my tech. I don't care about the quality of the camera. I'd like to keep the phone for years to come.The first phones I looked at were the Oneplus 6 and the Google Pixel 2, however they are much too expensive.Right now I'm looking at the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, which costs 330 euros on amazon.es and has decent battery and(apparently) great specs for the price. My only qualms are it not having an expansion slot for the SD card and a 3.5mm jack for audio, but that can be sorted with a USB-C adapter.Are there any phones you guys suggest?Thank you in advance.","420":"I currently have an LG G7. I'm mostly happy with it - fast enough for what I do, few if any bugs, love the double tap to wake. Some things are getting frustrating though, like having to charge 2-3 times a day, camera unable to focus and gives horrid quality photos (I've messed with settings to no avail), storage issues. I'm mostly looking for an excellent point and shoot camera that can keep up with a puppy. I browse social media, listen to music on streaming apps, and play the occasional lame phone game. I'm fairy hard on my phones, but I always get a case. I've been an android user for years. I am reluctant to switch to Apple, but could if it's the right move. I won't be buying outright. Will be financing through a carrier, not married to the carrier I have (fido). I'm in Canada. So price is... debatable. Don't really have a limit. I kinda have my eye on the note series for the pen with my job, but I've never had a phone that big before and I'm a little nervous. Are third party pens useable? Lastly, I hate bloatware. The old Samsungs drove me bonkers with it. Suggestions?Edit: don't care about audio jack or wireless charging! :) MUST have double tap to wake.","421":"I\u2019ve regretted buying an iPhone (iPhone 13) for the past seven months now. Before that, I had a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. I bought it because I had always used Android (from different brands) and wanted a change. At the time, no Android phone really appealed to me, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try something different. That\u2019s how I ended up getting a refurbished iPhone 13.Here\u2019s what disappointed me:\t\u2022\tFirst thing: I bought it in pink, but it actually looks more white than pink (not a big deal, but still).\t\u2022\tI almost always keep my phone on silent since I spend most of my time in class or at work, and I find the notification system absolutely terrible. There\u2019s no small icon at the top of the screen, and notifications barely show up on the lock screen, so I have to manually check for them multiple times a day. Because of that, I sometimes receive messages and completely forget to reply.\t\u2022\tI don\u2019t understand why my home screen wallpaper is blurry. I don\u2019t want it to be blurry, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to fix it in the settings. Either way, I shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings just to correct something like this.\t\u2022\tWhen I turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, why does it only stay off until the next day before turning itself back on?? I get that maybe it\u2019s to prevent unnecessary data usage, and sure, maybe I could change this in the settings, but I don\u2019t want to constantly mess around in the settings for basic things like this!\t\u2022\tWhen I watch a YouTube video in landscape mode while lying in bed, the screen doesn\u2019t automatically rotate. I have to exit fullscreen and reopen it for the orientation to be correct.\t\u2022\tHonestly, I thought I\u2019d get used to it, but I hate swiping to go back. When I\u2019m watching slideshows on TikTok, it\u2019s annoying to have to stretch my hand all the way to the edge of the screen just to go back\u2014it\u2019s just not practical.\t\u2022\tIn general, there are so many restrictions on what I can do, and I constantly feel like the phone is preventing me from using it how I want.\t\u2022\tThe mute switch on the left side: I find it super impractical. I have to fidget with it to know if my phone is on silent, and sometimes there\u2019s a delay (though I wonder if that\u2019s because my phone is refurbished and maybe the switch is faulty).\t\u2022\tTo adjust notification or alarm volume, I have to go back to the home screen because if an app is open, I can\u2019t adjust the system volume directly.\t\u2022\tFace ID: I don\u2019t know if mine is buggy, but a friend who has always used iPhones tried it and said it was normal, so I guess that\u2019s just how it works. But personally, I find it super slow; sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, and when I\u2019m lying down, it doesn\u2019t always recognize me. I had to make a Reddit post complaining about Face ID just for someone to tell me that when unlocking my phone, I could tap \u201cFace ID\u201d to enter my passcode faster. Like\u2026 it\u2019s written nowhere that I could do that. How was I supposed to guess??\t\u2022\tThe photos honestly aren\u2019t that impressive. I compared them to my 2018 Galaxy S8, and while they\u2019re decent quality, they\u2019re nothing incredible. In fact, I find them a bit dull.\t\u2022\tThere are no numbers displayed at the top of my keyboard.\t\u2022\tWhen I log into something and receive an SMS code, I have to tap on it manually to autofill it, whereas even my 2018 Galaxy S8 did this automatically. (Okay, maybe I\u2019m nitpicking here, but still.)\t\u2022\tTo turn off my phone, I have to press the power button AND volume up at the same time. The first time, I had to ask a friend for help because I just couldn\u2019t figure it out. I mean, if there\u2019s a power button, logically, holding it should turn the phone off.\t\u2022\tThe default calculator app is garbage, right? I\u2019m a waitress, and I use my phone\u2019s calculator to count my cash register at the end of the night. Who thought it was a good idea to remove the calculation history?? I don\u2019t get it. They want the phone to be so sleek and minimalist that it actually becomes unusable. I had to download a separate calculator app, which is just ridiculous.\t\u2022\tWhen someone calls me, there\u2019s no direct \u201cDecline\u201d button on the screen. Again, not a big deal, but I find it inconvenient.\t\u2022\tThe phone gets scratched super easily. When I first got it, I had to use it for two days without a case because mine hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Despite being careful, the metal edges already got scratched, and I have no idea how.\t\u2022\tThe snooze lasts 9 minutes??\t\u2022\tWriting and editing text on an iPhone is unnecessarily complicated.\t\u2022\tI can\u2019t close all my browser tabs at once.I know that a lot of these issues can probably be fixed in the settings, but:\t1.\tI shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings for things that, to me, should be basic.\t2.\tA brand-new iPhone is ridiculously expensive. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t buy the latest model, because for the price, this phone should be reading my mind.To give you an idea: in the first month, I was so disappointed compared to everything iPhone fans had told me that I actually went to an Apple Store to check if my phone was even real.I know I\u2019m complaining about a lot of little things, and maybe I\u2019m just used to Android, which makes some things stand out more. But considering the insane price of an iPhone, I feel like I have every right to nitpick.Anyway, I think I\u2019ll sell my phone this summer. (I hate doing that; I\u2019ve always used my phones until they were completely broken.) But I just can\u2019t see myself keeping it. I\u2019ll get something else instead.Edit: I also want to say that I don\u2019t like not being able to place my app icons on the home screen wherever I want. I don\u2019t get it\u2014the phone costs an entire month\u2019s salary. If I\u2019m paying that much and I want a page with a big empty space in the middle with no apps, I should have the right to do that, right?? I swear, I constantly feel like there\u2019s someone stopping me from using my phone the way I want for no valid reason.","422":"Here's my biased view -1 -  why it shouldn't be android Vs iPhoneyou can't compare iOS to android. It's vastly different. It's like comparing peanut butter Vs jam.Some people only like peanut butter, others only jam & some people have them together.If you like & are comfortable on iOS then I always recommend for people to not change.2 - iPhone secret sauceiPhone doesn't sell you on \"the best hardware\". They focus their attention on their operating system, ease of use & the main application most people use their phones for today - camera.They are usually 3-4 years behind on other android manufacturers on hardware feature - No fast charge, no QI share charge, smaller batteries, camera isn't 200mp, lower ram, no USB external storage etc.BUT they don't need those hardware features to stand out. Their software is simply the easiest to use. Children grasp ot quickly as do non tech savvy boomers.Plus messenger.3 -  Variety of choice - AndroidIn the phone space, only Americans seem to think it's \"IPHONE VS SAMSUNG\"Everywhere else in the world, the android phone market is segmented.Huawei was a real player pre ban Pixel exists & offers a unique Android experience - first to new features LG, Sony, Etc..Xioami & their sub brands are pushing hard in the mid range. Honor, VIVO, etc are all fighting for market share.Because of the insane competition, it's led to serious innovation.Return of the flip phones, 120W fast charging, the fold out phones, etc...These companies use the hardware innovation to distinguish themselves from the other android options.First to market doesn't always mean best. Apple don't need to be first, they wait for the technology to go through a few evolutions before introducing it.Also means they don't end up with exploding batteries (Samsung).4 - Familiarity is importantAdded from the comments - It's all about what people are used to. iPhone are popular in the US, so more older and younger folks use it, then they just buy more iPhones.If you have a Macbook, iCloud & apple accessories then I understand why you won't change.Interestingly, Samsung are trying the same strategy with their new watches. Some features are locked only if you have a Samsung phone. Which is exactly why I'll never buy a Samsung watch.5 - AffordabilityStop buying phones you can't afford just because you want to \"keep up\" with the cool kids.I buy my phones outright & will fix before I replace. On my second battery right now.Don't go into debt just because you want a \"slightly better\" phone for a year or 2.6 - MarketingThis is where iPhone really does destroy the competition. Their brand value, marketing & loyalty is unrivaled.Huawei almost managed to dethrone Samsung with their \"24 month replacement policy - no questions asked\". The Google ban pretty much destroyed that trajectory though.As someone who has tried multiple different Androids, the one area they really lack is in marketing.Oneplus is an INCREDIBLE phone but so few people know about it Xiaomi too. In the Western markets.","423":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","424":"Okay, real talk\u2014who else here has to carry two phones every day? One for work, one for personal stuff\u2026 or maybe you\u2019re rocking both Android and iPhone?I swear, juggling two phones is a whole struggle:  Ever leave one behind and panic for hours?  Awkwardly stuffing both into your pocket and looking like you have a brick?  Holding them both while texting or on a call\u2014yeah, not fun.  Notifications going off non-stop from two different devices.  Keeping both charged\u2014why do I have to carry two chargers everywhere?!If you\u2019ve got two phones, how do you manage? Any tips, tricks, or just straight-up rants? Let\u2019s vent together. \ud83d\ude02","425":"I am completely torn between these two options: OnePlus 13 (16GB; 512GB) and Pixel 9 Pro XL (16GB; 128GB). I'm a OnePlus user and a huge fan but the Pixel works to about $500 cheaper as far as the 2-year ownership costs are concerned. This is because my current provider does not have any promos for any of these devices but I can get a $500 promo if i switch to Mint. Now, OP 13 definitely has the better hardware (CPU, GPU and battery\/charger especially), but is it worth the extra $500 cost over 2 years? I'm a pretty heavy user (spend about 8-10 hours everyday on my phone) and require a super snappy experience while also being able to run multiple applications\/browser tabs at a time, multi task, etc. I do not take many pics, don't game, etc but I greatly value audio quality when listening through headphones. So, if you were in my situation, which would you choose and why?Edit: Thanks for the comments guys. I will be going with the OP. The 128 Gig storage and Tensor G4 seem like deal breakers to me.","426":"Since the iphone 16e launch today, that made apples already poor image look even worse. then i thought about it, are there even any good phone brands in 2024?Apples all over the place, the iphone 16 lineup is awful, the 16e they just announced is awful, apple intelligence is awful, and half the features dont even come to the older phones (like the 16e getting visual intelligence via action button, but not the 15 pros which have the same button). The base models still have 60hz, and the 120hz pro models are limited by ios to run at 80hz max. The only saving grace is that ipads, macs, and airpods are so good compared to the competition. Also if you are in the united states like me, have fun using anything but iphone. Having any android is basically begging to get made fun of.Samsung cant seem to get an update out for the life of them. It looks like oneui 7 isnt even coming out for the s24 series until may at the earliest. if you are on an s23 device then you can just forget it, oneui 7 probably isnt coming this year for you. Good hardware but the software is just okay. The camera still struggles to beat the iphones despite having much better hardware. The bloatware and having a samsung\/google variant of each app is just plain stupid and annoying. Basaically all they do is try to copy apple now a daysPixels just seem like a rip offs overall. Anything a pixel can do, a samsung or any other android can do better. Not to mention the garbage specs on pixel devices while costing just as much as iphones and samsungs. Pixels ui is pretty mid aswell. The main upside is that you are prioritized by google and get all the updates first. lets not forget to mention the pixel fold which is easily the worst fold on the market. The rest of googles ecosystem is practically non existent. They have a tablet which is not good, chromebooks which are also bad, and pixel buds which i doubt anyone is using. pixel watch is good atleast from what ive heard.Oneplus seems like the most reliable out of them all. The specs are better than every other flagship from the main brands while being cheaper. The only issue is that the camera does not seem up to par, and the software is not as feature rich as oneui\/ios. Also app optomization is worse than the 3 listed aboveChinese brands:I cannot speak for them as I live in the USA where they are banned. They seem pretty good, but like I said I cant really compare them lol.","427":"To the point that I have a bunch of phones from a few years ago that I rotate. But this can't be done forever. Batteries fail over time (the average of my phones are at least 6 years old).Then there's the issue of volte. It's no use to me to have small functional phones, if in the end they won't be useful to me, because they don't have IMS for that function. With what I have, I can still make it until 2030 if I'm lucky. But the rest of the operators are removing 3G this year. Some 2G until 2030, but others will do it before. Otherwise I either can't call or I have to resort to services like Skype, VoIP or WhatsApp.The problem is that I don't like anything launched in 2020 or later. Many measure 160mm or more. There are entry-level Xiaomis, which are already at 6.78\". You then put a rough case on them and that doesn't fit in certain pockets. Besides being uncomfortable. I refuse to carry a bag or shoulder bag like women do, to carry the mobile phone on them.On the other hand, I have some Moto e 2015 or Samsung A3 4.5\", which I use with a prepaid SIM and I use them to exercise. They are ideal and eternal. But in the end they are the first ones that won't even be useful for calling if necessary.The thing is that the most modern thing I have are two Samsung A20e from 2019. They are not a wonder. But they take up very little space at 5.8\". They measure less than 150mm. But of course, they won't last me forever. Right now I'm using an old Moto G5 Plus.It's not because I'm poor. I could easily use a Moto G for 200\u20ac or so. But I refuse to use phones that are annoying to carry around. Then it happens that we see more and more people addicted to smartphones.For me, the smartphone is a complement to the PC or tablet. Especially when I need to look at something in a hurry or I'm away from home. But I do things better at home with a keyboard + mouse. I don't consume all the content on the mobile.The only thing I can think of is that by then flexible screens will be standardized. Currently the only thing that could work for me would be a normal iPhone, a normal Galaxy S or a Pixel. But I refuse, because I've never spent 600\u20ac or more on a phone. And even less losing the micro SD and the 3.5mm jack port. For my part, the basic 128gb versions don't reach me. Since I have 100gb only for music on my phone.What to do? Even if you get something as a starter, it doesn't go below 6.5\" and that's with lousy screens, where the pixel density is terrible.","428":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading!https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6os3l9l2altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6fcdf4dd6f4d1aafd4fdccccb75bdca7235f407","429":"Hey folks, long-time Android user here with some thoughts I need to get off my chest. I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","430":"Hello everyone, I'm a Samsung user and have been a Samsung user for the last 10 years I usually bought $200 phones before i decided to invest in a better working phone. I currently have the Samsung s205g has been working for me GREAT for the past 5\/6 years. I have had no issues with it and seems to update its platform as Samsung updates the newer phones as it goes. The only this I currently dislike is the camera because , of course,  it's a 5 or 6 year old camera. The back of my phone is coming off due to me not having a case on it for a year and kinda neglected my phone a bit. Anyways, I have always been extremely interested in getting the iPhone just because it looks nicer and because it has FaceTime and I feel like with everyone having an iPhone it just works way better when texting.  My friends currently need to call me through Instagram video chat when they wanna talk to me. This is basically for people who had owned an iPhone and Samsung. I dont need biased opinions I really want to know what your thoughts are on the two phones. I'm really struggling to figure out which one to get because now that the new s25 came out I'm kinda digging the look but I also always wanted to see what the iPhone does. I'm so picky right now. Should I stay on Android or go to iphone???I'm overdue for an upgrade and have been waiting for the new android to come out before purchasing. Also wanted to add, can my bf still get my location with an iPhone? I currently share my location with him through Google and with my sister and is it hard to transport data from iPhone to Samsung or Samsung to iPhone because I heard from a coworker that because iPhone doesn't have some software or something like that that Samsung does that not everything will be transferable...","431":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","432":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading!https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6os3l9l2altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6fcdf4dd6f4d1aafd4fdccccb75bdca7235f407","433":"Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more \"dedicated\" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one exampleAs such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses*** **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as \"pointless and gimmicky\" and \"flawed,\" with its accuracy being \"horrific\". The software is still in development for the button.* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a \"Frosty glass\" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra*** **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone\u2019s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around \u00a31,199\/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of \u00a31,249\/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL*** **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a \"pure\" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem*** **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple\u2019s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android\u2019s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google\u2019s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem\u2019s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.","434":"Howdy folks. I am tossing up on finding a new phone for my dad. Looking to keep price under $400 AUD \/ $265 USD, so mainly looking at refurbished \/ used phones. Here's a list of things that I know he will want \/ need in a phone:1. eSIM capabilities. He will want to travel a bit over the next few years so this is important2. Decent battery life. He tends to forget to plug it in at night.3. Telephoto camera. Not absolutely essential but he definitely likes the zoom camera on my S20 Ultra, so I can see him enjoying this.4. A good fingerprint sensor.5. A decent sized screen, 6.5\" or larger. Nice loud speakers would be great too as he is a bit deafI'm not too worried about the phone having bloat as I plan to debloat and set it up to be nice and clean for him, but I do think a clean stock-like experience would generally be preferable. I'll also be getting a good case for him immediately. Storage is not an issue, he doesn't have heaps of apps and his stuff syncs to cloud services anyway. A flat screen would be preferred so I can put a proper screen protector on there. I've been doing some research of refurbished phones and I have put together a small list:Option 1: Oppo Find X5 256GB in very good condition with exception of cosmetic damage on rear - $274Option 2: Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus 128GB in very good condition - $372Option 3:  Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus 128GB in very good condition - $414Option 4:  Google Pixel 6 Pro 128GB - Very good condition - $372Option 5: Google Pixel 7 Pro 128GB in \"Good condition\" (probably pretty scratched) - $431Thoughts appreciated! Also open to suggestions that I may have missed.","435":"Assolutamente! Ecco una possibile traduzione della tua richiesta, cercando di mantenere lo stile e il tono originali:English Translation:Hi!Unfortunately, I have to consider replacing my Redmi Note 12 Pro as it's becoming increasingly slow. I'd like to keep it as a backup phone.Basically, it can't handle multiple apps in memory anymore. For instance, if I switch between a banking app for OTP and a shopping website, I randomly have to repeat the process several times.I've had issues with Xiaomi devices (bloatware, overheating, updates that don't actually update much...).I use social media a lot, and I occasionally play games like Zombie Waves (which requires handling many enemies on screen despite the cartoonish graphics) and Siamo Guerrieri (a tower defense game).So, I need: * Reliability * Heat dissipation * Clean software (I had a Nexus 5 in the past and loved it)   I'd like it to have eSIM support to use services like Holafly without worrying about data limits when traveling.   Among the three, I'm intrigued by Nothing, especially since a colleague of mine recently got one, and it's the only one I've seen and held in person.   I don't know if the prices will drop during the upcoming Amazon sales, but I don't want to be left without a phone either.   I'm open to all suggestions!   P.S. I haven't been following HDblog for a while and I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of writing and the reviewer's responses in the comments.   P.S. 2 I'm also considering the top-tier phones to have a device that lasts longer (this one hasn't even lasted a year...). I've come across the \"old\" Pixel 8 Pro, the Moto Edge 50 Ultra, and last but not least, the OnePlus 12.   I'll definitely wait for the Google sale on the 27th (although there's already a great price on Phoneshock)...   I'd appreciate your opinion, thanks in advance.","436":"I\u2019m in the market for a new phone and having a hard time choosing! Right now I have an iPhone 7. Prior to that I had an iPhone, prior to that I had a Samsung, and nothing before that is worth mentioning because it was so long ago. I\u2019m looking to spend ~$300 and looking at refurbished phones. I just can\u2019t spend $700+ on a new phone. I\u2019m not loyal to either iPhone or Android. I\u2019ve used both easily. But I do like when I don\u2019t have to rewire my entire brain to use a new device. This is why I was thinking of sticking with iPhone. Google Pixels look interesting to me. I\u2019ve had recommendations of Pixels because they have great cameras and they sync to your existing Google account. Backups are easy. That\u2019s attractive to me. Right now I pay for Apple Cloud service. I would probably cancel it, and it seems like it would be a headache to save all my data and move it somewhere. I know it\u2019s a small headache, but it\u2019s a deterrent. I like the small size of the iPhone 7. Most phones are significantly larger, even the Pixel 6a and 7a. These are dumb considerations - I\u2019d have to get new charging wires and it seems like there aren\u2019t as many Pixel cases available. They seem more expensive and uglier. Having a better camera is important to me, but any newer phone has a better camera.I hated that when I went to iPhone, I was no longer able to record phone calls. That was useful to me back then. Now if I need to, I have to put it on speaker and record with a separate device. Do androids still allow call recording? Without notifying the other party?I hated that the iPhone 7 removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack. Now I\u2019m used to using Bluetooth earbuds, but I still hate it on principle. I thought some Android phones started putting them back in, but they seem few and far between.Battery life is fairly important to me, but I know all batteries degrade over time. Being able to have the battery replaced easily is a priority. The Apple store replaces iPhone batteries for $50 in one afternoon. Can you do that with Samsungs and Pixels?On my iPhone, it was really easy to configure the accessibility settings to make the screen very dim for the nighttime. The \u201cNight Shift\u201d setting kicks in automatically too. I find almost every screen to bright for my eyes. I just triple click the button and it dims significantly. It\u2019s important to me that my new phone allows something like that. It has to be just as easy. I found iPhone\u2019s ability to automatically adjust to the brightness of the environment much more intuitive than Samsung. Perhaps that has changed.I like the way the iPhone has the swipe up menu of icons that let me turn on the flashlight, change brightness, switch to camera, turn on do not disturb, pause music or skip ahead, etc etc. That menu is customizable.I dislike any phone that has a screen all the way to the edge, but with a piece cutout of the top. I want a rectangular screen.I saw that some Pixels don\u2019t allow you to turn off the camera shutter sound. That would be a dealbreaker for me, but it seems like only phones from certain countries overseas have that setting built in.I was initially frustrated by how iPhone doesn\u2019t allow you to customize much, but I\u2019ve gotten so used to it, I can\u2019t remember what specifically was annoying me. The main thing keeping me reluctant to change from iPhone is how utterly simple it was to switch phones last time. It kept every setting, every bit of data, down to all of my open tabs in the browser. It was so streamlined, it required no effort at all and blew my mind. I know there are apps that help you switch from iPhone to android, but even having to download an app is more steps than I want to do having experienced the smooth transition from iPhone to iPhone.Are there any overwhelming reasons to switch from iPhone to android? I\u2019ve been looking more at Pixels than Samsungs. I know there are other brands out there. Willing to check them out, but I\u2019d need to hear more about their benefits. Has anyone else been in the same boat struggling to choose a new phone? I plan to keep the phone for as many years as it keeps working, which is hopefully, I don\u2019t know, at least 3?I know I\u2019m rambling. Just wanted to highlight the things that are important to me.What phone do you recommend?","437":"Hi Guys,I am planning to buy a phone, and was wondering how people thinking about the following.Please, if you expect this question to be Android vs IOS, and you are the kind of person who already knows you gonna say def. Iphone or def. Samsung, pls just skip this post. Thanks:)  For those who is interested and have some knowledge about this question, thank you for helping me.  So I have used both IOS and Android before and I am very into Tech. Development so I am not support crazily any of the OPS side. I do see both of them has benefits as well as issues that might be a huge factor when I consider buying them.For me I was an early IOS user, most probably at that time I did not know how good it was, and constantly running into losing datas due to not knowing how to store them properly (?)So I switched to Samsung, however have no experience in switching phones ever since, so I cannot say with Android it would not happen once I am chaging devices.Anyone who can confirm switching Iphone-Iphone is a lot seamless than Samsung-Samsung? I consider buying Samsung Galaxy S line, and as far as I see it, like the way I did before buying my current device, Samsung Account has similarities like Apple Cloud.One of the main factor for me is to have all the datas from the old phone when changing to the new one. Since I have my photos synced with Google, its fine, that part I dont care. But like phone numbers, password etc.. I want them to be remembered even when I switch.I could never do that before, when I switched from Iphone 5 to 6, I lost all. When my mum switched from 7 to 15, I backed up everything, and still for some reason, most of the contact cards lost. Believe, I have watched videos, and was pretty sure all the data is saved. But maybe it was the reason, that she did not have iCloud? Idk...But my BF has proven me wrong, because his phone got stoled, and when he got it back, everything was normal (he had Iphone 11), all his data was there. Also he just switched to iPhone 15, before that he did a backup, we checked, and everything was on iCloud! Really cool!! On his current phone, everything was like it was before in Iphone 11, only the cover changed. That was always something I valued in smartphones.Since I hate loosing datas, I try to backup everything so this is the only thing I care mostly.For me I used my father's Samsung Galaxy S9, so I bought an S20FE after, but I think I did not create Samsung Account on S9, also I lost it, that is why I could not recover data.  But now I feel like even if my BF lost his phone, maybe he would be able to recover his data if he buys a new one, counting that it would be an Apple product?I hope if I eventually buy a Samsung S line product, that would apply as well, but I have no idea tbh..:\/However I use Google for storing contacts as well, and that's something I can confirm 100% that they can be restored any time, because it's linked with Google Account.Also idk on Iphone but on Android I do have an option within the app to do a backup, so I can reinstall every conversation back, I believe if I ever need it.But for iPhone, what I saw was like when he installed it, all our history was there, and that was insane!Is it iCloud? What is mindblowing for me, is that my colleauge she has an iPhone as well and I bet she has millions of pictures, and she showed that she has it from years back!!Does iCloud store it that way, that it archives old pics? Bc my BF showed me it tooks time to reload old videos\/pictures, but it stored everything he ever took.Idk if we have it on Samsung, because I use Drive, but for me I feel like I need 500GB or more, bc 100 was not enough now I am nearly full with 200GB plan.  That is also one of the reason why I switched to Android, thinking base storage is not enough, and at that time I could not afford Cloud Plans (was very young), so I decided to use Google instead, and my laptop for storing datas.  But it would be very nice, if I can do it honestly on 1 device. I love using multiple IT devices, no worries, but I can now see that maybe everything that I was afraid before regarding how Apple devices functioned has been improved, and it works seamlessly.And about the storage, I think he has less data to store, than me, but iCloud is only 5GB thats nothing, bruh, but still it seems like every data can be found? How does it work, actually?:O  That was long, thanks for reading:D Looking for some good insight, please let me know your experiences, I honestly love both Samsung and iPhone, but for those what I shared above, I would appreciate if you guys give me some tips on how to decide.I hate the feeling that a new phone is literally new, because I have lost most of my data:')So storage, personal datas  like passwords, game history, chat histories etc..Thank you so much!","438":"hi, I'm looking for help with a recurring issue that won't go away. I'm putting a lot of somewhat technical details in this long post in hopes that someone with experience in the field can give me some pointers. I haven't found any resolution on this issue and am kind of desperate for a fix. any help is super appreciated.in short, I'm wondering if it's possible that there is a problem with my specific phone number, which I've had since 2015. The issues I'm about to describe started right when I got this number, and have stayed consistent through many phones and two different providers. The issues: - calls frequently drop as soon as I try to make one - I miss days worth of SMS at a time; sometimes a few days worth of texts will flood in like a torrent, and other times I never receive them at all - phone frequently goes right to voicemail, at times when I definitely should have service (as evidenced by my wife, on the same plan, trying to call me when we're together and my phone going right to voicemail) (she does not have these issues and she's probably more pissed about it than I am) - MMS has difficulty downloading. at times I miss entire chunks of group texts. the first three issues occur intermittently, without warning, all at once. it's tough to pin down a frequency, maybe every few months, sometimes more, sometimes less. MMS issues are more frequent. at times only one issue happens at a time. it's hard to pin down! What's odd is that this has occurred with the same number through both Verizon and T-Mobile, and with various iPhones and Pixels. the issue began when I switched to Verizon and got a new number in 2015. I couldn't believe that when I switched to T-Mobile and got a Pixel in 2021, the issue did not go away. I've switched sim cards, I feel I've tried everything except for getting a new phone number, which I'd prefer not to do. an important detail that I had forgotten about until recently is that in 2015, when I switched from AT&T to Verizon and got this number, it took FOREVER to sync my new number to my new iphone, like 20-30 minutes. the Verizon techs didn't know what was going on, but eventually the two synced and we left without thinking twice about it. it's pretty irritating to me and my family when they can't reach me. we've since switched to Whatsapp to make calls, since my data seems to work just fine at all times. I'd prefer to live a Facebook-free life though, so I'd like my number to work! I did find a fix that I used for a whole, it involved me typing in a combination of numbers and *s\/#s to my phone to reset the carrier; but, I've lost the code I used to type in, and the issue would only be resolved until it occurred again, so it wasn't a permanent fix. given that this only seems to affect my phone number (and not my data), that the issue has occurred over multiple phones and providers, and the issue with getting my number set up in the first place, makes me wonder if the problem is actually my phone number?? I'm wondering if it's possible that something strange happened with this number before I even got it in 2015. Is it possible that this phone is hooked up to some other service, like text-to-type or a translation service, or if the number was, like, tapped or something? I know nothing about this stuff, just grasping for an explanation. has anyone ever heard of anything like this? any resources or tips or other subs to post this in would be very much appreciated. thanks for your time in reading all of this, have a good day!","439":"I've always been an android user. My first phone was Nexus 4, followed by Samsung one, replaced by OnePlus 3 which I accidentally broke and now own Galaxy S10e.I've recently got myself a Galaxy Active 2 watch. I also use Airpods (second gen as I don't like in-ear) and Macbook that was given to me by my employer.I consider my self a tech geek and I use Linux as my daily OS (apart from Mac for work, since corporate stuff is way better in Mac and I hate windows). I used to tinker with my Linux a lot, I used to tinker with my Android a lot but I got to a point where I want things to **just work**. I don't care about 3d party launchers, billions of apps doing the same thing unperfectly, hardware that don't integrate well with each other and I started to glance at Apple ecosystem.Here as some pain points that I have:1. I went with Samsung phone simply because it was the only normal (normal = less bloated and as close to vanilla as possible) phone that was under 6\" in screen size. But then I realized that Samsung tries to be Apple. They have their own Galaxy Store (which is terrible and full of ads), they have their own apps for Notes, Calendar, Email - but I honestly happy with Google counterpars. But their phone is tied a lot to their apps, which make sense. You decline a call, you can quickly add a Reminder to call back and etc, so now I have Samsung Reminders and Google Reminders in their calendar. The state of android phone in general is very fragmented. Google pixels are inconsistent, being abandoned quickly, overpriced. Samsung tries to be Apple. Xiaomi have their own software and customizations. OnePlus does not have a line of small phones (less than 6\") and their selling point us pure Android.2. I decided to get a smart watch to complement my connected life and do quick tasks from my watch. I decided to get Samsung one because I have a Samsung phone and because I understood that WearOS is in a very sad state. However I quickly found that Tizen lacks a lot of apps - no normal to do list (I use TickTick), no navigation, Bixby is shit, it works great only by using Samsung apps such as calendar (which I dislike), the selection of watch faces is terrible - there is only one watch face that supports showing upcoming event (one of the main reasons I decided to get a watch so that I always can know when is my next meeting). I even considered designing my own Watch Face but the only way that Samsung gives you access to Calendar is if you decide to write your watch face in C with their own terrible template language. I understand that WearOS is not that in this regard, the selection of apps is not great, many things are broken (I've read that Google Assistant was broken for a long long time) and the watches are way under powered to run WearOS smoothly. Overall the Watch ecosystem is very fragmented as well. Google Fit is terrible, Samsung has their own Health, other companies like Mobvoi release their own Health apps. All this creates a digital nightmare - I use polar Heart rate strap which obviously syncs to Google Fit and not Samsung Health, but I use Samsung watch so I want everything to be in Samsung Health - well guess what? You can't sync Fit to Health, so there is 3rd party app that I was happy to pay for that does this. A freaking nightmare.3. General hardware support. I really like Airpods. Their support with Android is not great though, sometimes they don't connect, sometimes only one airpod connects while the other wont and etc. I always try to find some \"native\" replacement in terms of pixel buds, galaxy buds and etc, but according to reviews none of them are better than Airpods and all of them are In-Ear which I dislike.Seeing friends around me who switched to Apple tell me how smooth the integration between things, makes me envy and want to switch. Android phones today are not priced cheaper than their Apple counter parts (Galaxy S21 Ultra costs 1k$ compared to 1099$ for iPhone 12 Pixel 5 costs 699$ compared to 749$ for iPhone 12 \\[all prices are from GSMArena\\], Galaxy Watch 3 costs almost the same as Apple Watch 6, Galaxy Buds Pro cost almost the same as Airpods Pro) so price is no longer the winning factor.I've also heard that iPhone tends to be supported longer, while with Android is a guessing game whether you are going to get the next version or if Samsung\/Lg\/OnePlus\/Xioami going to release it and when.Things are constantly changing with Android. Samsung used to have useless page on the left scroll (Samsung Cards or something like this), now its Samsung Free (which is still useless). Samsung pushed its own Messages app which as I understand are now being replaced with Google Messages (so I have no idea if my **1 year old** watch will support Google Messages down the line or I'll stay with a watch that has partial functionality). Google keeps killing apps - there was Google To Do - now Google Tasks (which is terrible). The iteration of messages went from Hangouts to Duo to Messages and I'm tired of switching apps every time Google decided to abandon theirs. I do like Calendar, Gmail, Drive and Photos - but even here I'm not yet sure I'll commit to Google One (as I'm running low on free storage) and might look elsewhere.I'm no longer young and careless. I need my gadgets **to work**. I no longer care how my Launcher looks as longs as I can reach my apps quickly. I don't care for third party Launchers or replacement messages apps. I want robust, consistent applications. Apple has them while Android don't. Sure its not all Apples and Oranges with Apple, they have their own problems, but usually you find better apps with better support on iPhone and WatchOS (TickTick for example is developed for WatchOS but not for Tizen or WearOS). You also pay premium for Apple, but most of the premium Android phones cost similar to Apple.So I'm having big doubts recently. Help me convince my self that Android is better than Apple.","440":"A friend of mine has type 1 diabetes (T1D). These days, there's a lot of tech to make that disease easier to manage, including open source apps. She uses some of that already, but she does so on her main smartphone. This is a problem (I'll explain why later), and there are some type 1 diabetics who have a dedicated phone for dealing with the blood sugar management.Note: Type 1 diabetes is most likely _not_ the type of diabetes that comes to your mind, since 95% of all diabetics have type 2, and only ~4-5% have type 1. So, if it sounds strange to have tech to manage diabetes when perhaps your aunt \/ grandma \/ etc. use pills and some insulin, keep in mind that these types are *entirely* different diseases. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease, type 2 isn't, etc.She needs to run one app that receives data via Bluetooth Low Energy from a sensor she wears on the skin and reads every 5 minutes her current blood sugar level. And she needs another app that connects to her insulin pump and auto-regulates insulin infusion based on her current BG level. There are actually a fair number of type 1 diabetics who have such a \"closed-loop\" system, because it makes blood sugar management a lot easier, and even enhances safety, because situations with too low and too high blood sugar are significantly reduced in frequency. (The app can watch and regulate the blood sugar 24 hours a day, a human cannot, at least not without going totally insane and burning out.)This means that the following are essential in such a \"T1D smartphone\":* Great Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE connectivity. This one is extremely important, because connections to insulin pumps and sensors work through Bluetooth. If the phone's Bluetooth hardware\/stack is crap, and connections frequently are lost, the phone is unusable for this purpose.* Either no aggressive battery optimizations, or aggressive optimizations that can be turned off entirely. These apps must run always, and must not be killed off by the OS for power saving purposes. It is clear that this means that the battery runs out of energy faster then, and this is an acceptable tradeoff.* Must not be too big, meaning the screen diameter must not exceed ~5.5\". That's because she'd have to carry 2 phones, and her main phone is of a typical size of contemporary phones (so, 6 inches and above). There's no need for a big screen on that second phone, and keeping it small helps with the room in her pockets, purses and such. (Too small is also not OK though, anything that measures less than 2.5\" gets too difficult to operate in daily life.)* Must not be too pricey. Around $400 is the limit.* Android 9 support minimum. It is fully OK (even preferred) if this can be achieved via flashing AOSP or LineageOS on the phone.And the following are not necessary at all in such a phone:* Super beefy SoC is not required, since these apps aren't computationally demanding. It should not be a super slow SoC of course, but as long as the UI can remain snappy, it's fine. Video streams and games will not ever run on that thing. Nor will it be used for browsing.* Front camera is not needed at all. Back camera is not needed either, but pretty much all phones have one. But even if one is present, its quality is totally irrelevant. It can be a super crappy camera that shoots 320x240 pixel photos, does not matter, because it won't be used. Unlocking via facial recognition, well, she prefers a fingerprint sensor (see below).* Second screens. Won't be used.* Ability to be folded.* Huge amounts of flash memory. These apps do not produce much data, and the phone will barely have anything installed at all except for these specific T1D apps.Finally, some nice to haves:* Fingerprint sensor to quickly access these apps. Very handy.* Plenty of RAM to help keep everything snappy and minimize the chance of the OS running out of free memory.* Big battery. Even though, as mentioned above, these apps must not be subject to battery optimizations at all, it is still nice to have a big battery capacity.* Rugged exterior to reduce the chances of the phone breaking or otherwise becoming unusable (like a crack in the display that renders the touchscreen non functional).* Minimal bloat. Ideally, it would be a stock Android setup, or something close to this.An unusual request, I realize this, but still, perhaps some of you guys can help me out here to find a suitable phone for her. I was eyeing the Galaxy J7 for example. Some smaller Ulefone phones also seem interesting, but I do not know about their Bluetooth connectivity.EDIT: Thanks for the input from you guys. While looking at the suggestions I stumbled upon the King Kong Mini 2, which, as it turns out, seems to have become a favorite among some loopers. Bluetooth works really well, and it is a cheap and small phone. No fingerprint reader, but that is tolerable. It does kill apps sometimes that don't have a foreground service running though, so that needs some work. But, most phones seem to do that though.","441":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","442":"Since the iphone 16e launch today, that made apples already poor image look even worse. then i thought about it, are there even any good phone brands in 2024?Apples all over the place, the iphone 16 lineup is awful, the 16e they just announced is awful, apple intelligence is awful, and half the features dont even come to the older phones (like the 16e getting visual intelligence via action button, but not the 15 pros which have the same button). The base models still have 60hz, and the 120hz pro models are limited by ios to run at 80hz max. The only saving grace is that ipads, macs, and airpods are so good compared to the competition. Also if you are in the united states like me, have fun using anything but iphone. Having any android is basically begging to get made fun of.Samsung cant seem to get an update out for the life of them. It looks like oneui 7 isnt even coming out for the s24 series until may at the earliest. if you are on an s23 device then you can just forget it, oneui 7 probably isnt coming this year for you. Good hardware but the software is just okay. The camera still struggles to beat the iphones despite having much better hardware. The bloatware and having a samsung\/google variant of each app is just plain stupid and annoying. Basaically all they do is try to copy apple now a daysPixels just seem like a rip offs overall. Anything a pixel can do, a samsung or any other android can do better. Not to mention the garbage specs on pixel devices while costing just as much as iphones and samsungs. Pixels ui is pretty mid aswell. The main upside is that you are prioritized by google and get all the updates first. lets not forget to mention the pixel fold which is easily the worst fold on the market. The rest of googles ecosystem is practically non existent. They have a tablet which is not good, chromebooks which are also bad, and pixel buds which i doubt anyone is using. pixel watch is good atleast from what ive heard.Oneplus seems like the most reliable out of them all. The specs are better than every other flagship from the main brands while being cheaper. The only issue is that the camera does not seem up to par, and the software is not as feature rich as oneui\/ios. Also app optomization is worse than the 3 listed aboveChinese brands:I cannot speak for them as I live in the USA where they are banned. They seem pretty good, but like I said I cant really compare them lol.","443":"I\u2019ve been a huge fan of small\/normal-sized smartphones for years and have been using an iPhone 12 Mini since launch. I love the form factor\u2014it fits perfectly in my shirt\u2019s breast pocket, is super convenient for one-handed use, and has been a reliable. Before the Mini, I started with the iPhone SE (2016) then 7 after switching to iOS from Android , and honestly, I\u2019ve never looked back. My all-time favorite design was the iPhone 5S, and when Apple introduced the SE, I was thrilled. Then came the 12 Mini, and it felt like a dream come true\u2014a compact, full-screen device. For my use case (YouTube Music, WhatsApp, photos\/videos, browsing), it\u2019s been perfect. iOS has kept things stable, bloatware-free, and just so easy to use. I am not a power user. A bonus of the smaller phone? It\u2019s helped me cut down on media consumption. I removed Facebook two years ago, YouTube a year ago, and Twitter\/Reddit\/9GAG four months back. Recently, I dropped Instagram too. The 12 Mini helped me stay focused and intentional. Now, after 4 solid years, the battery is depleting, and I\u2019m running into microphone and speaker issues. It\u2019s time for a replacement, and sadly, Apple doesn\u2019t seem to care about small devices anymore. In my opinion after iPhone 13 sereis, Apple newer models don\u2019t offer anything revolutionary except better chips, USB-C, camera button and minor tweaks.I live in India, and here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:* Screen size: **5.5 to 6.1 inches** (nothing bigger!)* Budget: **$400\u2013$600*** Battery life: At least **1 full day+*** Clean UI, **no bloatware**, and reliable after-sales support.# My thoughts so far:1. **Apple:** No small options anymore unless I settle for an older 13 Mini.2. **Pixel:** Amazing camera quality, but the after-sales service in India isn\u2019t great, and the chip\/build quality isn\u2019t top-notch. In my opinion they will not survive long use.3. **Samsung:** Possibly the S24 or S25 as a balanced choice with good hardware and after-sales.4. **OnePlus\/Nothing:** Both are doing exciting things, but I doubt they\u2019ll ever release a device under 6 inches.Are there any Android phones in the market (or upcoming) that offer a compact form factor, clean UI, and solid hardware? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who\u2019ve made the switch from iPhone Minis to Androids.","444":"Hello Guys, recently ive been thinking on buying a new phone and since i have mine since 2018\/9, i need a new one for sure. I dont know hows the market at this moment and time, but im seeing some stuff but yall think i should wait for a phone or no?  I want a phone that will be with me for a long time, i know that now phones, finally, have a lot of years with OS updates and 5\/6\/7 years with security updates which i really like.These are the phones i have been seeing:One Plus Nord 4;Iphone 16e(absolutely not, i just seen it and is not worth it to me);nothing phones;...

","445":"To the point that I have a bunch of phones from a few years ago that I rotate. But this can't be done forever. Batteries fail over time (the average of my phones are at least 6 years old).Then there's the issue of volte. It's no use to me to have small functional phones, if in the end they won't be useful to me, because they don't have IMS for that function. With what I have, I can still make it until 2030 if I'm lucky. But the rest of the operators are removing 3G this year. Some 2G until 2030, but others will do it before. Otherwise I either can't call or I have to resort to services like Skype, VoIP or WhatsApp.The problem is that I don't like anything launched in 2020 or later. Many measure 160mm or more. There are entry-level Xiaomis, which are already at 6.78\". You then put a rough case on them and that doesn't fit in certain pockets. Besides being uncomfortable. I refuse to carry a bag or shoulder bag like women do, to carry the mobile phone on them.On the other hand, I have some Moto e 2015 or Samsung A3 4.5\", which I use with a prepaid SIM and I use them to exercise. They are ideal and eternal. But in the end they are the first ones that won't even be useful for calling if necessary.The thing is that the most modern thing I have are two Samsung A20e from 2019. They are not a wonder. But they take up very little space at 5.8\". They measure less than 150mm. But of course, they won't last me forever. Right now I'm using an old Moto G5 Plus.It's not because I'm poor. I could easily use a Moto G for 200\u20ac or so. But I refuse to use phones that are annoying to carry around. Then it happens that we see more and more people addicted to smartphones.For me, the smartphone is a complement to the PC or tablet. Especially when I need to look at something in a hurry or I'm away from home. But I do things better at home with a keyboard + mouse. I don't consume all the content on the mobile.The only thing I can think of is that by then flexible screens will be standardized. Currently the only thing that could work for me would be a normal iPhone, a normal Galaxy S or a Pixel. But I refuse, because I've never spent 600\u20ac or more on a phone. And even less losing the micro SD and the 3.5mm jack port. For my part, the basic 128gb versions don't reach me. Since I have 100gb only for music on my phone.What to do? Even if you get something as a starter, it doesn't go below 6.5\" and that's with lousy screens, where the pixel density is terrible.","446":"# Hey guys!\\-----I need help choosing my first phone.

amazing, got it for free when at&t cut off 3g (i didnt even have a plan, it was prepaid) decent camera, fast, surprisingly durablemotorola g7? worked fine, got it for 100 bucks in 2020lg g7? worked fine, no issues until its battery started goingsamsung s8 active? worked greathuawei tracphone from forever ago, back when smartphones ram was listed in megabytes? responsive, fast for browsing, watching videos was finethis phone out of box(me and friend both experience this)? takes a solid 5 seconds to get to its own home screen, every click has a whole second delay before the phone registers an input, sometimes even longer,commonly seems to just forget you touched the screen at all. browsing is like beyond frustrating between the input delay, phone ignoring inputs, horrible wifi speed, like ill click something and have to wait 5-10 seconds to even tell if i should click again unless i want to watch a random ad because it auto clicks as soon as the 1st page loads.camera, which claims 50 megapixels?? worst ive ever had, this thing has to have some prohibitively small sensor, you will literally get noise in broad daylight i am not joking. the 50 mp setting for the back facing also makes it to where you cant zoom in and is NOTICEABLY lower quality than the 12 mp setting, i really dont understand how you make a camera so bad post 2016. beyond that it also takes like 10 or so seconds to open, even using open before unlocking feature. if you want to capture a moment quickly as its happening, an animal, a friend goofing off, any scene at all really, you are better off just drawing it from memory unless you want to be awkwardly telling your friend to hold that candid organic smile for a minute or 2. selfie cam and video setting also cannot lock exposure???? almost all of my previous phones have had that feature like i dont understand why you would take it off.the gps is by far the least accurate ive seen since phones started coming out with gps. i can stand still in an area with good connection and the phone will seemingly estimate within the nearest 200 yards. itll think you teleported 2 steets over,it will often think youre going the opposite of the direction youre going, if youre on the interstate going over another road it will teleport you onto that road, take 20 seconds to reroute, then take another 20 to find out why youre not on that road. ive been driving before and had it think i turned onto a \"road\" that isnt on the map and goes to the middle of a lake, im not kidding its commical. the amount of times it has thought i was swimming in the middle of the mississippi or that i was driving into a building. idk i guess a plus is that its made me learn how to navigate without using the map at all lmaoand we havent even addressed the issues that commonly cropped up over less than a year of use :)phone will now enter a random click mode where it believes im clicking 100 random spots at once, making the phone unusable. sometimes itll just think im clicking 1 spot 100 times, making just unlocking the phone impossible because it thinks im spamming the backspace button. this is the phone people make memes about like \"fbi agent opens your phone, tells your mom to go fuck herself, sends your crush your most embarrassing selfie, contacts isis, threatens to blow up friends house, deletes all your social media\". ive had to embarrassingly explain to my boss that i \"butt dialed\" their phone 3 times in a row :). typing is faster on a flip phone by a lot.its to the point where i believe all of the reviews that praise it are most certainly fake or paid for by the company, not even on some conspiracy shit, like the website reviews saying this is a \"great budget option!!\" are lying through their teeth. most of them praise things that have been standard for years, i saw a site say \"this phone can do everything! it can browse the world wide web, listen to spotify, take pictures of your family, and even watch movies on netflix!\" and i feel like thats one of the biggest tells. if this phone has any of the specs it claims to have then there must be some \"we hate poor people\" software that semi bricks the phone by default. the folks that say things like \"well its a budget phone, get a more expensive one, you get what you pay for\" have never owned the phone, or have absolutely no clue what the standard for budget phones is, and theres people out here recommending it to people looking for phones with a budget of 200, like yall gotta be some plants theres just no wayEdit because i forgot soooo many things: phone cant unlock itself like 25% of the time, its as if the hardware cant run the software and it just doesnt know what to do. It will display random error messages (unlocked it once and it refused saying \"disabled screenshot feature due to security reasons\" or something like that) and has fits if you restart it. Like it waits until you open the phone to do its start up processes, so if you restart your phone and leave it for like a whole week, as soon as you open it, \"phone is starting up\" and it acts as if its coming out of a literal coma. Edit because of suggestions from users: sorry guys, i tried all of the things below and as of august 16th, no setting changed anything, no amount of cache clearing, updating, running on different modes, etc. This just rekindles my reason for such a rageful and lengthy post, whoever made this phone needs to be punished in the fashion of the times this phone is reminiscent of and should thus be burned on a stake","448":"I am currently using a phone that is absolutely horrendous.

You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

The back button is so good, it was weird for like half a day, and then it became so natural, now when I use my old Android phone, I miss the ease and intuitiveness of the iPhones, and it feels somehow weird that I need to go to the bottom and click on a button all the time I wanna go back, when I can just swipe, and it\u2019s easy to get it right 99,9% of the time even as a newbie. Whoever says that only those prefer this over a universal back button who have been longtime iPhone users, I politely disagree!2. I have zero complaints about the iOS keyboard over the Gboard, which was also a frequent complaint by many users that I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s basically almost the same thing, except that iPhone has a sexier typing sound and that\u2019s why I lowkey prefer it over the Android version.3. Personalization: well yeah, this is a very preference based thing, but for me, it\u2019s not the most important thing for me in the world. I can see that it\u2019s still lacking even after the iOS 18 update compared to android, but I prefer a well made, smooth and simple design over a goofy, weird, sometimes quirky, but unique look. And I\u2019m a girlie who likes to pimp up my phone to make it look cute, but I feel like I can still do that with iPhone, or I can download some app if I wanna go the extra mile. Overall, I prefer well-made and lag and quirk free over super unique.4. My only real complaint is about the gallery, I preferred my Android gallery, but I hear iOS used to be good as well until this recent update which kinda ruined it for me, but I hope they\u2019ll get back to the older style.Overall, I love this thing, and I feel like I made the right decision, it just feels premium and good quality, something that\u2019s well-made, and I don\u2019t care about all the fancy extra features that Samsung or other Android phones can offer, like yeah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fun for a week, but then you won\u2019t even use it again. Personally, I prefer something that works smoothly, with a well made UI , and I enjoy using this thing every damn day, and now I can talk with my boyfriend using iMessage hahaha I feel like I\u2019m part of a cool kids club now. :PThat\u2019s all, thanks for listening to my TED talk! :D","451":"Title.My current phone, A OnePlus 6T, is one I used since 2017, and it's time to let it retire.  Heck, I could turn it into a dashcam for the car or the bike if I can have it use GPS without a phone plan (hooray for upcycling!).**Here's what I'm looking for:**\\- My budget is up to $1000, including accessories.  One of them can be 3D printer filament since I own a Bambu Labs P1S.\\- 1 TB of storage data.\\- Unlocked AT&T that can use a nano-sized SIM card.\\- I need an amazing camera that can capture wildlife images without getting too close, especially birds with their quick movements.  Hopefully, I can capture pics of bugs and other tiny critters without needing to turn on pro mode.\\- It has a good microphone for audio capture when recording videos or just sounds in general so I won't need another accessory.  If that isn't possible, one can be included in the budget.\\- I need it to run smoothly when I play games and not have its battery drain too quickly.  Pokemon GO is one I would love to play a bit more smoothly.\\- 5+ G data, but can use older data towers.\\- The phone does not need to be the latest model.  If the price is right compared to the hardware and lack of bloatware I am getting, that would be great.  I am interested in hearing about any upcoming sales from reliable online retailers that may help here.\\- The only AI I want from the box is Google's.  Not Samsung's or anybody else's.\\- I do not want pressure sensitivity since I do not like drawing on my phone.  Screens are typically too small.\\- I want the phone to be as future-proof as possible.\\- It must have the ability to cast to any HDMI device like a TV or projector without downloading any other app via cable.\\- Something that may not be possible, but I would like for it to block calls from anywhere in the world except for places I give an exemption to.  I don't want to treat all incoming calls from those not in my contacts list as suspicious.  Also, not needing any other app for this.","452":"Best match for posting my questions I found, hoping someone can give me some insight.For long I\u2019ve been really annoyed about battery life, sluggish performance and lacking camera capabilities in my old Samsung Galaxy Note 8. It\u2019s been a perfect phone for me for a long time, but having to charge it 2-4 times per day with regular use alongside with a now cracked camera glass which introduced smudgy photos made me take the decision. I got a new phone, and it was a bold move to iOS and the new iPhone 14 pro. I knew what to expect regarding battery life, smooth performance, Face ID and camera setup.After changing phones, which was not super smooth (lost 90% of text messages etc, but I\u2019m fine with it), everything seemed fantastic at first.Now I\u2019ve had the new phone for almost two months and there are some really really disappointing things that keep annoying me on a daily basis:- The touch screen is a lot less precise then my old phone, I keep having to zoom in websites to be able to hit correctly. And I do not really have big fingers. I\u2019ve had no issues with this on my Note 8 and I hit everything I tried first attempt most times. With the iPhone it won\u2019t try and hit anything unless I zoom. For me this seems like something basic for a smartphone and it\u2019s really starting to get on my nerves.- Playing some media\/app music from videos and such tend to drop out every now and then. The solution is to try again from scratch, it may or may not work. Perhaps it\u2019s an app related issue more than iOS, I don\u2019t know.- While in a car I cannot find an option for choosing audio output to not be the car, while still have Bluetooth connected to the car. This audio source output selection seems available when in a call, but not in general use? Maybe I\u2019ve not figure it out.- At random times the phone get seriously hot where I expect the processor to be. It\u2019s uncomfortable to the touch and I usually restart the phone to fix it. This happens with lights useage(scrolling webpages of social media, nothing extra open or draining background apps). Perhaps it\u2019s an issue with the recent processor? I have not contacted the dealership about it yet, it doesn\u2019t occur every day.Other than that I am very impressed with the video quality, but actually a bit disappointed about the pictures, comparing latest new phones, where it seems other manufacturers are now producing more pleasing pictures. One of the reasons I chose to pickup and iPhone for was the great pictures it produced. They are still great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it seems not as good as the most recent competitors.Things that I DO love are the smoothness, battery life, Face ID and to a great extent the camera setup.I know it\u2019s hard to get all bells and whistles, but it seems some of the issues are unnecessary or lacking in 2022\/2023.Thoughts?( I regret sometimes that I did not pickup the Pixel 7 pro instead..)","453":"Hi Guys!I'm new on reddit, just joined the community not too long ago, but I always wanted to talk about this topic for a few years now.. with that said, Lets begin!I tend to read a lot of websites, blogs, watch youtube videos.. but for some reason some of that information is misleading in a way, or forced to do it for advertisement and what not.. so I'm here to give you my side of things, an idea, and overall REAL experience.. no one is paying anything or forcing me to do this in any way at all.. so I'm just being honest with this. I've been using iOS since the early days. Since the iPhone 3G.. so basically it was my first Smartphone experience besides having a Palm treo back in the day...Owning an iPhone back in 2008 was one of the best experiences you could have because you had a touchscreen (multitouch) no pen needed, not a bulky phone at all.. of course you can argue that it was not the first with that technology, BUT it was clearly one of the BEST in its class. so the years passed and i grew more and more into apples Ecosystem and their way of doing things. their clean OS in and out, their apps, the content, the quality of things. it was JUST amazing for me.. since the iPhone 3G.. i bought every other iPhone model that was announced year after year.. so people might even argue that I was even an iSheep or AppleHead..but there was just no competition at all,(Blackberry was VERY popular where I lived, BUT for some reason it just did not get my attention at all) apple was ahead of the game back then.. google was announcing something different, and me, being a tech guy, I was interested about it.So the years passed and then Google Launched its First Smartphone. The Nexus One. It was a pretty impressive phone and really promising for the company but then again, i was so into apples ecosystem and liked apple so much, that i never tried it... UNTIL..Few more years passed, i had never tried any android smartphone at all, just saw a couple ones, samsung jumped in the game as well, other companies got bigger, Motorola, HTC, Sony etc. They all jumped into the Flagship Android devices, so android was definitely a DIRECT competitor now.. so i started giving more attention towards where google and their OS (Android) was headed. So 2011 came.. and I had the iPhone 4.. and rumors about the iPhone 4S and all that.. in that year, the Samsung Galaxy S2 came out and well it looked interesting but i still waited a year to get that.Next year.. for some reason i got the Samsung Galaxy S2.. I saw it so much, and people was switching to samsung phones i really thought it was a big deal.. si i gave it a try.. for a week... I Still had the iPhone 4S.. but i had to try the hype i guess..So i tired the Samsung, and i did not even last a week with that phone. to begin with.. the Google Store for me... was so unorganized, apps had no restrictions and SO many ads everywhere. but well.. i still liked some aspects of android.. the fact that you could customize every aspect and truly make it yours.. that was actually a new thing for me.. but not that much really it was on some early days.. also another thing that was horrible for me.. was that some of the apps i frequently used for iOS where not even available on android.. or nothing close.. or some of the same apps.. where just not the same.. actually some were even missing some content.. that was only available for iOS.. so that really hurts the overall experience.. some might say that it could probably be because I picked the wrong phone to begin with.. but i still had to try it somehow... but for a first try... i HATED it.. of course.. me being an apple guy (AKA iSheep) I couldn't accept anything else that wasn't iOS.Again.. a year passed and I Obviously had an iPhone 5.. BUT I also forgot to mention guys that Jailbreaking was a BIG role on my overall experience on iOS.. so obviously not the purest iOS but everyone has to agree that a Jailbroken iPhone its the closest thing to customizing your iOS experience.. and let me tell you something... it is THE BEST way to go.. but thats another topic.. So  I had the iPhone 5 and i loved it.. the competition with android though was getting better and better every year and I always wondered if I should probably give it another try... and by the end of year I made a decision... I Managed to TOTALLY get rid of my iPhone 5 and jump on the android side of things... and what actually made me jump to it, was the HTC One M7.. I loved the quality of the phone, it reminded me on Apple in a way. the built quality, the screen, Front facing speakers, it was just a perfect phone to try and I so happened to have the opportunity to get it.. so I did.. knowing that since I was actually trading my iPhone 5.. there was actually no way back for a while.. but I decided to take that \"Risk\" lol if you can say that switching phones is a risk.Then again.. the first few days i was just trying to get used to it.. downloading apps, looking for good app replacements because the play store got so big. finally some of my favorites app made it to Android.. and the ones that did not make it... android had their own apps that gave you a pretty good experience, but obviously paying a price.The first week, it was good, but to be honest, I was not getting used to android.. It was hard for me.. an iOS user that had invested time and money on the platform, to suddenly change like that.. but to be honest it was just on small things like... no more Airplay, some app content was different still.. for iOS.. music syncing was still different.. transferring photos, contacts, videos, info etc was still a thing to discover... BUT other than that.. I started to LOVE this phone.. it was fast. The screen was the perfect size and 1080P.. lol no 720P here or so called Retina display. The speakers were loud, and front facing, it made every audio, watching content MUCH better, also wearing headphones.. a difference there as well.. so... to be honest.. the things I thought were bad about android.. were slowly fading away the more I used the phone. The software, having widgets, having everything at a glance, at the fingertips, easy access toggles, switching between apps and stuff, it was just great. I started to like android a LOT.  I was forgetting about iOS completely and slowly changing the way I saw iOS BUT don't get me wrong... they both have their pros and cons.. but at least in the Specs department... you still feel that you get more bang for your buck on android.. (Then again, this can only be applied for certain models, not for every android phone out there).I spent a year with my HTC, I really loved that phone, but for some reason I missed iOS now.. i wanted an iPhone back into my life.. so I bought an iPhone 5S.. obviously and as tradition.. I Jailbroke my iPhone.. well.. It was good to be back I must say.. but for some reason I felt i Downgraded on some hardware stuff.. but on the software side of things... I felt right at home. I kept switching thought..and now.. I really like android too.. after my HTC I also got a OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2.. they were some nice phones.. also a Motorola Moto G just to tinker around and rooting them.. I like Tinkering with an OS.. I was going to college at the time and I was also going for a Software Engineering too, so I knew what I wanted and what I was doing.. this helped me a lot, but anyways.. It came up to a point that I decided to create a Bottomline for Both iOS and Android experiences.. THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL OPINION.... I'm not an apple guy anymore, I'm pretty neutral now, i like them both. iOS is a great platform.. If you have your own apple ecosystem.. your mac, you Apple Home kit, apple watch and everything apple.. then I don't see why changing.. Its a very stable platform.. its simple, clean, organized. IT JUST WORKS. and thats fine.. you like it, you have the money, why not get it. BUT its just too closed, restrictive, and not open to changes.. sometimes changes are good. Android in the other hand... its still in development.. but with every year.. its getting there.. its getting closer and closer.. if not already passed iOS in many ways.. flexibility, hardware wise.. and I'm not talking about benchmarks.. or raw cores, power, etc. Im talking about ease of use, customization, making something that is yours, YOURS! of course everything its not perfect.. they still have no control over software at all, they have so many different models and iterations, and integration and cleanness its not a very great thing when you compare them both.. but that does not mean its not great.. overall I like all of androids features.. and IMO I would still take EVERY Nexus Device (Googles very own software) that is the way to go.. clean system, quick updates as soon as google launches them, and overall a good support.The future is always uncertain, but All I can tell you is that Android (Google) is in the right path.. they just launched their Pixel Lineup and i think its a great step of controlling both hardware and software just like apple does. hopefully we see some great competition between this two, because when other companies compete each other, its always better for the customer, we as consumers get GREAT products.I hope you liked this post.. of course its not as detailed.. but I like to always tell the story behind my actions, and the process as well.Thanks for reading this! have a great day guys!JG.","454":"I can buy a new phone next month. Currently using a S7. I have been watching a ton of reviews. I primarily use my phone for Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube. Each phone has its advantages and disadvantages. It is hard for me to decide. **Note 8:**Better display, headphone jack, comes with earbuds, 2GB extra of RAM, expandable storage, s-pen features.Obviously, the display is amazing. Would be great for YouTube and browsing Twitter. I don\u2019t really use my headphone jack on my phone besides when I\u2019m driving in the car. 2GB extra of RAM doesn\u2019t concern me. Storage isn\u2019t an issue either. 64GB is enough for me. S-pen seems cool, don\u2019t know how much I would use it.**Pixel 2XL:**Better speakers, unlimited video and photo storage, better camera, stock Android (no bloatware), better battery life.Bezels are kind of annoying compared to Note 8 but the audio is so much better. Unlimited photo and video storage is kind of neat. Don\u2019t take too many photos besides Snapchat. Stock android seems awesome. I hate bloatware on my S7. Battery is also very important to me. ","455":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","456":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading!https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6os3l9l2altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6fcdf4dd6f4d1aafd4fdccccb75bdca7235f407","457":"Hey folks, long-time Android user here with some thoughts I need to get off my chest. I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","458":"For a few years now, Samsung Galaxy Smartphones were my favorite brand when it came to buying them, especially with the arrival of One UI and its customization layer and later due to its collaboration with Google, becoming the second most updated brand.Until I bought the S24 ultra and in a matter of the first 3 months I had 2 factory defects. The first, the charging port broke down and they fixed it, but only a month later, the image stabilizer when taking videos vibrated and made noises (defects that happened to many and even in previous ultra models I read What was happening too...)Well, I got tired and decided to sell it and even though the exchange rate was lower, I bought the Google Pixel 8 pro.I was certainly looking for a great camera on a mobile phone and I chose well.Yes, it is true that I miss One UI and its customization, certain native photo editing modes and little else. But overall the Pixel 8 pro is a great device.I don't plan to change my mobile at least until early 2026.So I'm looking forward to seeing what the future Pixel 10 pro and S26 ultra will be like.I wanted to ask several things to those interested about this topic.Have you had problems with the Samsung Galaxy and have you changed brands?Do you think it's better to stay with the Google Pixel or should I give Samsung another chance?Any other brand that takes great photos like the Google Pixel pro and updates as frequently as Samsung? I rule out the Xiaomi ones, I already had them and I don't feel very comfortable with them.On a smartphone my priority is the camera, native customization and updates.For now, and with the exception of customization, the Google pixels do more than enough. Since I'm looking for photos with natural colors and well, the Samsungs have a great camera but they saturate and contrast more than I would like. The interpretation of each manufacturer is a matter of taste.And another option is iPhone but I prefer Android.","459":"So let me tell you all a little story, seeing as I am not a Redditor.In 2020, I bought myself a snazzy new phone known as the **Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G** (I suppose they aren't paying the naming staff much lately)I've loved my new phone for the last 2 years. The day I bought it, I got a nice case from Gear4 and a back\/front glass protector.\u00a0Several days later, my front screen protector came off because the screen has a silly curve in it and it makes it nearly impossible to not have the screen protector peel off.well, I thought to myself *\"No problem. I've owned Samsung phones since I was 13! I've never broken a screen before (aside from that one time I crashed my motorcycle. Can't really expect my phone to survive that) so it should be fine. Scratches might be annoying, but I'll just be careful!\"*Two years go by, and nothing wrong or bad ever happens to my phone. No scratches, no cracks, nothing. I was thoroughly impressed by the glass! So imagine my surprise, when about an hour ago, I was sitting on my couch, not doing anything particular.I had my phone sitting on the couch next to me, and had a Bic Lighter resting on my knee. I was sitting cross-legged so my knee was roughly... 6 inches above the couch? Maybe a bit more or less...\u00a0I happened to shuffle slightly, and knocked the lighter off of my knee. I heard it bounce off my phone (should be no problem, a lighter weighs like maybe 2 or 3 grams) and didn't really worry too much about it.So I turn to grab my lighter and I was met with quite the sight.My **$1,800 CAD** cell phone, which I have had for 2 years without any physical damage, now has a massive crack in it and the OLED display now flickers\/tears\/discolors on the bottom half. It even has a lovely little impact crater where the lighter made contact and a nicely defined solid line across the middle of the screen emanating from the impact crater.I can't help but be **extremely** disappointed in both Samsung and Corning (the people who actually make the glass for these phones) as there is no reason that this should happen.I do understand that there is a certain amount of luck when it comes to your phone surviving any impact. However, there should never be a situation where such an extremely light item, impacting with minimal force, from a low height, should cause such substantial damage to the device!Furthermore, it only accentuates my disappointment that the screen is now *barely functional* in it's entirety! When I owned previous Samsung phones I managed to damage the front glass to a much more extreme extent. Above I mentioned one of my phones being destroyed by a motorcycle crash. The crazy thing is, the glass was 100% destroyed, like, you couldn't really see what the screen was displaying because of the sheer amount of cracks.\u00a0But the screen still displayed things, you just couldn't see them due to the glassSo how is it, that I paid **$1,800 CAD** for this device and it's thwarted in such an extreme way by a 3 gram Bic Lighter?I thought this phone was drop-proof up to 6 feet, not 6 inches.How can Samsung honestly claim that this is a \"Premium\" phone when it's construction clearly lacking even when compared to budget phones, even in Samsungs own lineup?When I pay nearly 2 grand for a hunk of glass and metal that costs Samsung\u00a0maybe\u00a0a tenth of that to produce, I at the very least, expect it to be\u00a0more durable than the **$200 Galaxy S7 I bought off Kijiji** to replace this **$1,800 piece of garbage**.The worst part is, that my warranty has expired. I called my local Samsung Certified Repair Shop and they quoted me\u00a0***$550 plus tax and part cost!***So you're telling me Samsung, that my cell carrier never even offered me your Care+ protection, or the extended warranty, I can't buy it individually because my device isn't brand new, and then you're gonna charge me **\\~$800** total to replace the screen that really shouldn't have even broken in the first place?Honestly, I think that Samsung intentionally inflates the prices of their screens. Let's see here, on Amazon, I can buy a new screen for **$77.41** (It even includes all the tools I would need to fix it!).\u00a0([source](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Galaxy-Note-Ultra-Replacement-Samsung\/dp\/B08NGLQK8W))Huh. Strange, that's nowhere\u00a0near **$550**... Let's keep looking.Oh my, I can buy the entire\u00a0Screen Assembly (which is everything but the actual PCBs, Battery and such for those who don't know, but it does include the entire metal shell, backglass and connecting ribbons for the screen) on FixEZ.com for only\u00a0$174.10. So, I can replace my phone's\u00a0entire frame, colour, back glass, front glass and screen for less than a quarter of the price of\u00a0just the screen at a repair place.([source](https:\/\/www.fixez.com\/samsung-galaxy-note-20-screen-assembly-with-frame-bronze-premium?utm_source=google_shopping))Ok, just looking at price, that's closer to $550, so let's keep looking.Holy smokes, at iPartsExpert.com I can get the\u00a0AMOLED Screen and Digitizer Assembly (Not including the whole frame) for just\u00a0$176.15!([source](https:\/\/www.ipartsexpert.com\/details\/grade-b-amoled-screen-and-digitizer-assembly-part-for-samsung-galaxy-note-20-n980-note-20-5g-n981-without-logo-sku660101452a.html))So, how exactly is it gonna cost me nearly $800 to get my screen replaced?\u00a0Maybe it's labour right? Cell repair is a skill and it takes time to learn. Maybe it's that right? Maybe Samsung pays their technicians really well so they do a really good job? Let's look into it.According to Glassdoor \"Technician salaries at Samsung Electronics can range from\u00a0$24-$26\"([source](https:\/\/www.glassdoor.ca\/Hourly-Pay\/Samsung-Electronics-Technician-Hourly-Pay-E3363_D_KO20,30.htm#:~:text=How%20much%20does%20a%20Technician,range%20from%20%2424%2D%2426))Ok, so let's take the high number, $26. So how long does the average screen replacement take?According to Samsung\u00a0themselves \"Your scheduled visit will take less time and your repair will generally take\u00a0less than 2 hours.\"([source1](https:\/\/www.ubreakifix.com\/ca\/samsung-repair\/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-5g))([source2](https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/support\/repair\/pricing\/#:~:text=Start%20your%20repair&text=It%20is%20recommended%20to%20schedule,take%20less%20than%202%20hours))So, let's do some math shall we?Screen cost + digitizer cost (using the 3rd example we found because I think it would be the best fit for a repair tech to actually use to fix my problem specifically) =\u00a0**$176.15**2 hours of labour\u00a0@ $26 per hour = **$52**So, we have **$228.15** so far. At least we have exceeded the 1\/4 point. Let's add tax now.I live in Canada, particularly Alberta, so the tax rate here is 5% (GST)So,\u00a0$228.15 + 5% = **$239.56**So from my quote of\u00a0**$550** plus tax and part cost, let's just ignore the last bit there, assuming the gentleman at\u00a0UBreakiFix simply gave me the wrong information. I like to give the benefit of the doubt. So, let's add tax to **$550** and see what our grand total will be.$550 + 5% = **$577.50**So, what's the difference?It costs Samsung\/UBreakiFix\/Other Samsung Service Center\u00a0**$239.56** in parts, labour and taxes.They charge me (the customer who already gave Samsung **$1,800** of my dollars for the phone that costs them a fraction to produce)\u00a0**$577.50**So I'm to believe, that there is a cost somewhere equal to **$310.44**?I can even understand a bit of a markup. Get that bag obviously. The company has to company.But you are doubling (actually more than doubling) the price it actually costs you to repair the device you're already over-charging for.This is absolutely despicable. I don't think I will ever be on-board with buying a Samsung phone ever again. I'll stick to buying non-luxury phones. I don't really like spending thousands of dollars on \"luxury\" and \"the newest hardware\" and \"the best display\" only for all this \"best\" stuff to break when I drop a 3 gram Bic Lighter on it.I know that largely this post will make no impact. I know that nobody particularly cares. I know Samsung probably won't read this. I know people will keep buying these way over-priced phones. There's nothing really to be done, at least by me.But if this post can reach one person, just one, and open their eyes to Samsungs predatory business practices, I'll be happy.Not only can I not root and remove all the battery-wasting bloatware from the device I paid for and own, but I also can't even go to an authorized retailer for a fair repair price.So I guess I paid $1,800 to\u00a0use the device? I don't really own it? I was under the understanding that when I give a company money in return for a product I now own that product. I guess this isn't true for Samsung.\u00a0Seeing as you can build your own Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra for just\u00a0548.90 U.S. dollars\u00a0and it would be 1:1 the exact same hardware. $548.90.An interesting fact is, that what Samsung is doing is actually technically illegal. Did you know that dear reader? At least here in Alberta Canada (but also many many other places including the rest of Canada and the United States), what Samsung is doing is against the law. (Check spoiler for a quote from Mondaq)>!\"Alberta's Consumer Protection Act prohibits suppliers, in a consumer transaction, from charging a price for goods or services that grossly exceeds the price at which similar goods or services are readily available without informing the consumer of the difference in price and the reasons for the difference.\" !<The sad part is, there is probably not a law firm on earth that would try to challenge Samsung. Because Samsung will just dump millions onto lobbying to change the laws.Regardless, after doing all this research, I really have a bad taste in my mouth from Samsung. And I've been a fanboy of Samsungs for\u00a0years and years.Genuinely, really disappointed in you Samsung. From your flippant anti-consumerism to your blatant lying on your phones stat pages, to your entirely deceptive marketing, to your non-compliance with Right to Repair laws.Simply disabling our ability to open the bootloader (which was available in previous devices as recent as the newest models if you buy them from other nations) puts Samsung on the bad side of the law. I bought my device from my carrier outright. Meaning I own this device and all the rights to it. So why exactly can I not install my own ROM or modify the internals of Android (which is Open Sourced by the way)?The AOSP (Android Open Source Project, upon which Samsungs firmware is built) uses the\u00a0Apache 2.0 license. Which, if you're not familiar, is an Open Source Software License. And in Google Corporation license for the AOSP it states rather particularly:\u00a0>!Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Google and to recipients of software distributed by Google a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work !<([source](https:\/\/www.mondaq.com\/canada\/dodd-frank-consumer-protection-act\/963318\/price-gouging-prohibitions-across-canada#:~:text=Alberta,the%20reasons%20for%20the%20difference))Basically what this string means, (this comes from the above source), is that when you make your own version of the AOSP, you\u00a0have to grant Google and anyone who receives the work (you and me for example)\u00a0a lifelong, non-revocable license to use, change, sell, or transfer the work.Now tell me, when we buy a Samsung Galaxy Device (which runs on Android, and therefore must obey the license mentioned above), do we get the rights to change the work at all? No? Because we can't gain root access or unlock the bootloader? Huh... strange... it's almost like Samsung is violating Consumer Protection laws\u00a0and the AOSP license.Yeah, I don't think I'll be supporting this company anymore. And I really hope anyone who reads this can agree with me. Ultimately, buy a budget phone for like $100 from Wal-Mart. Don't waste over $1,000 on a device that it cost them less than half to actually make.Samsung, Apple, they are all scam companies. Hands down. They are ripping you off, I just provided you proof of them screwing all of us in several ways. So please, be a good consumer and speak with your wallet. This company doesn't deserve to be worth $500,000,000,000 and they are because we have allowed them to abuse and brow beat us into paying exorbitant prices for products that cost them a fraction to actually produce.Samsung, you've officially burnt a bridge with a customer you've had for over 10 years. Even though I know you don't care, I hope at least this reaches enough people to hurt your pocketbook. Then maybe you'll stop trying your hardest to bankrupt each and every one of your customers.#EDITI also posted this on the Samsung forums, Samsung themselves deleted it off the forums. They didn't give me a warning or anything like that. Just removed it. Very glad I also posted it here and saved all the text and stuff. I've never been censored before, it's pretty fun. I wonder when they will sick the fanboys on me? lol#EDIT THE 2NDI have been banned from the Samsung forums for posting my little story on their website. The reason they presented for being banned from their community forums was \"Violating the community guidelines\"The post I made on their website is pretty much verbatim what I posted here. I don't think anywhere in my post I swore or made any inflammatory comments or anything... I guess it really was censorship.","460":"Hello, I'm in the market for a new smartphone now that my Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is slowly getting over the hill (started being very weird about charging recently). I've narrowed down the search to two devices: iPhone 13 mini and Zenfone 9. The Zenfone is around $50 cheaper than the iPhone where I live.I want a compact phone, my current one's screen is 6 inches and that's already barely tolerable for me. I also want to use this phone for as long as possible because I hate the ordeal of finding a new phone to buy - bought my current one in the summer of 2018 and am kinda disgruntled that I have to buy a new one already lol. I've also never used an Apple device for more than a couple mintues.I'm not a heavy user, I usually make a couple calls at work and listen to music\/watch youtube on my short (around 20 minutes) commute. At home I mainly scroll apps for a bit at work, put on a youtube video while doing the dishes (around 40-ish minutes), then scroll a bit before bed. I'll use my phone more on my days off but I try not to do it too much, so it seems like the battery will not be a huge issue for me. However, sometimes my work requires me to drive somewhere (usually within 1,5-2 hours from our office) and take photos that I will later rely on at work (I'm an assistant electrical design engineer dealing mainly with low voltage power lines, transformer substations, PV systems, sometimes some indoor electrical\/lighting installations, it's important to me to get a good photographic documentation of the place I'm working on), so definitely looking for a phone that a) will have the battery capacity for GPS navigation for these trips and b) will have a camera that will give me good, sharp images in different conditions.So these are the basic things I need from the phone. Other features I use currently that would be nice to have:* Multiple scheduled alarms - I usually have multiple alarms set 10 minutes apart to help me get up in the morning. Would be great to have the same set-and-forget option on the new phone.* Bocking numbers - I sometimes get calls from numbers I look up to see if they're spam and block them if they are. I'd like to keep doing this.* Call recording - not a must but I sometimes have trouble remembering all the details during a work call so I rely on recording the conversation for later use.* Music playback - I use spotify as well as listen to music from my own local files.* Connectivity - When I'm out and about, I listen to music on my phone via wired headphones and I have no intention of going wireless. I also own a 2008 car with no wireless connectivity so I use an aux cable when on the road. Were I to get the iPhone, are the lighting-3.5mm jack any good?* File organization - I like to move the images and other files I save between folders, rename albums etc.* I use Gmail as my only mail app and Google Drive to transfer files between my computer and my phone from time to time. sometimes I'll use a cable for the latter as well. I use a Windows PC.* My main method of unlocking my phone is a fingerprint sensor. I understand the iPhone doesn't have one and I'm not a fan of the idea of Face ID so I'd probably be just using the password if I decided on it.* I don't need a ton of customization options. I need a no-nonsense phone that just works and lets me set up my own homescreen, lockscreen and ringtone.* OS - I've grown to hate the MIUI OS. It's bloated with apps I don't use, some of the system apps I do use are riddled with ads, the settings app is weird and unintuitive(thankfully it has a search bar). I need a phone that will be snappy, not laggy and just good to use without digging through unneeded apps and weird menus.And I think that's it. I'll be happy to answer any questions and grateful for any help in deciding between these two fine phones. Currently I'm slightly leaning towards the iPhone for its camera and smaller form factor but I'm kind of worried about the battery (hard to tell which voices bemoaning the iPhone battery are from people like me and which are from power users lol) and getting used to iOS.","461":" I have to make a decision: to stay with Android or try iOS for once in a lifetime.  Until now I have always had smartphones with Android (in the order Samsung Omnia HD, HTC Desire, Galaxy S5, and the current one, Google Pixel 3a).  Since my father would like to change his phone and I would give him mine, I have the opportunity to replace him.  Furthermore, I never liked the stock Android interface very much indeed, but I'm not even a person who installs various launchers to customize it, on the contrary, I think that customization is now the last thing that interests me, despite years ago on ' HTC Desire I tried practically all the existing custom roms, and then went back to the stock version because it was free of defects.  I am undecided between an iPhone 12 or a Galaxy S21, I know it is a considerable expense but I intend to keep the device as long as possible.  I've never had anything from Apple in my life, I've always heard of them and I've used some of their products sporadically, especially MacOS from High Sierra onwards.  The thing that holds me back in taking an iPhone is that I find Bixby more complete as a voice assistant and the same goes for the automations possible with Samsung (even if I have never tried them in the field).  Furthermore, as it is made, the Apple store seems more chaotic than the Android one, but it is certainly just a matter of habit.  Another thing holding me back from switching is the lack of an always on display feature on the iPhone, which I find very useful and which I exploit quite a lot.  On the other hand Samsung does not drive me crazy because I find it intolerable to use applications like Samsung Healt that have inside advertising banners, for this I do not compromise.  Consider that I also look at Windows 10 wrong when it offers me to install certain applications (functionality that I disabled as soon as I installed it).  I had read that IOS 15 could bring the always on display also on the iPhone but I would say that if it happens it will be from iPhone 13 onwards ....  In short, I'm quite indecisive.  I realize they are trifles, but I personally pay attention to them.  In other hands I still hate Samsung for some choices made, I also don't like the fact that I have dual applications on the phone, such as two galleries (Google and Samsung), two voice assistants (Assistant and Bixby), two browsers (Samsung Internet and Chrome), two email clients (samsung mail and Gmail) and two digital payment methods (Samsung Pay and Google Pay).  It must be said that they can be disabled and from a certain point of view it is called \"choice\".  Another thing to say about Samsung is the removal of the MST sensor which was the thing that made it possible to use it pretty much anywhere. Reading around the reason is because more and more POSs support NFC and make the use of MST superfluous.  But after this change, I see no reason to use Samsung Pay rather than Google Pay. Really, if anyone has this answer I would like to hear it. I'm not argumentative, but I'm curious.  But on the other hand, I have more things at home that would bind to the Samsung ecosystem, in fact from what I know its applications integrate very well with Windows 10 after the partnership with Microsoft, which makes them recover some ground towards the Apple ecosystem.  I have an Xbox Series S and a Samsung TV at home, in short, let's say that I somehow already live in the Samsung \/ Microsoft ecosystem, here is another reason that makes me hesitate.  In short, the desire to try \"the competition\" is great, but my rational part tells me that perhaps it is better not to do it, at least for the moment, while the more enterprising one tells me to throw myself and try. At most I can resell it because the positive thing is that over time the devaluation is less than for android smartphones in general.  And as you rightly said, Apple's support as software updates over time is much longer and better than any other, which makes your purchase much more valuable and this is by no means a trivial matter.  There are a couple of other things that make me really mad about Apple are these:  Speaking of MacOS, the calendar widget in Big Sur cannot be synchronized with the calendar application. What does it mean? That once the widget is shown, I can't see at a glance if I have any commitments on a given day, if they had for example put a red dot on the days when I have a commitment it would have been a welcome thing and I think more intuitive.  Another thing: in Apple Maps the street where my parents live is written wrong. I reported this to Apple via two friends' iPhones and it was never corrected. In the street name there is an extra \"i\" at the end of the word.  I know these are little things too, but from devices that aim to be excellence both in price and in software, I think these little things make a difference and given the price I really struggle to pass them on.  Last thing always inherent to MacOS: but is it possible that QuickTime still cannot play all video formats? Some MKVs don't want to play them, while Windows Media Player works with just about everything.  I know there is VLC but the speech I just made is always valid.","462":"**One Plus (2017 - Oxygen OS 10.3.9) Vs. iPhone Plus 8 (2016 - iOS 14.4.2)** This is the feedback of **my experience** after using One Plus 6 for one month. I will try to highlight the strong (+) and less strong (-) points of One Plus:**Migration:**\\- No backup capabilities from my iOS apps to my One Plus device unlike iOS.&#x200B;**Battery:**\\+  Charges faster (although it requires a special cable);\\+  Last longer.&#x200B;**Screen:**\\+  Larger screen (no bezels);\\+  Bigger resolution;\\+  You can configure shortcuts to turn the lantern on among others;\\- No force touch.&#x200B;**Store:**\\+ You can download any APK from anywhere so you can have things like a PS1 emulator, although you have to be careful with your sources.&#x200B;**Unlocking the screen:**\\-  You always need to pick you your phone in order to unlock it;-  If the light is low (which was the case most of the time for me), face id doesn\u2019t work. If I need to pick up the phone in order to unlock it (since touch id is on the back), I personally prefer to have a smaller screen and the touch screen on the front.&#x200B;**Gestures:**\\-  Hiding the keyboard gesture should be from top to bottom but instead it relies on the \u201cgoing back\u201d gesture;\\-  Going back and going forward gestures take you out of the app:\\- This is especially annoying when trying to grab discord room pane since you go out of the app often.&#x200B;**Photo camera**:\\+ Better resolution;\\-  No live photos;\\-  No QR code Native reader;\\-  No measuring tape capabilities (lacks AR).&#x200B;**Definitions:**\\- When I want to disable something like the dictionary it doesn\u2019t work immediately - in order to deactivate the dictionary you need to do it in 3 different places;\\- Locating the keyboard definitions is also a challenge, to see this you can simply search \u201ckeyboard\u201d and you will get 5+ different options instead of one place with everything.&#x200B;**Night mode:**\\- Night mode is full black and not dark tones. This makes some options less easy to locate.&#x200B;**Brightness:**\\-  Since I changed to iOS I never had issues seeing my screen but on One Plus this happened more than 5 times during my 30 days experience. The automatic brightness mechanism needs to be reviewed;\\-  Because of this I was forced to change to manual adjusting which was even worse, since I couldn\u2019t see anything on my screen and you need to pull down the quick access pane twice and move a really small bar in order to see. Doing this without seeing the screen is no easy task (this is especially true when you are outside).**Notifications:**On iOS, when I receive notifications they are present on my locked screen until I unlock it. When I unlock it and lock it again, my locked screen gets automatically cleaned and it will only show new notifications. This leads me to my first point here:\\-  No notification center;\\-  No notification segregation: If you get a message on an IM app and you didn\u2019t read a previous message from a different chat you get notified with all texts from that app(on iOS you get 1 notification per message);\\-  You can\u2019t read more than 1 notification at once if your screen is locked:\\- You get the message \u201c2 new notifications from *app*\u201d;\\-  Turning off the \u201cprivate notifications\u201d isn\u2019t done in only one place either and even that doesn\u2019t solve the problem on the previous topic;\\-  The char cap for the notifications is too short;\\-  You get notifications when you take a screenshot;\\-  I get notifications when I download an image;\\-  I get around 3 weather notifications per day;\\-  If you search for a football team **once** on google, be prepared to get notified every time that team starts to play, there\u2019s a goal, the squad is announced, etc;\\-  Sticky notifications should not be a thing:\\-> I know that I have an update, do I really need to see this notification until I update? I find this too intrusive;\\-> I know that my battery is dying, I don\u2019t need that glued on my screen;\\-  The light color for charging is the same as the new notification light, which mislead me a few times;\\-  If you have a sticky notification the blue light also lights up after a while which makes it useless;\\-  You only have small symbols on icons when you have notifications while on iOS you have numbers: I prefer to have numbers and this is possible to do on this phone but not natively.On iOS, you can read full conversations without even unlocking the screen and you can disable this at any time if you don\u2019t like it.You can also decide that you want to receive notifications with work emails but you don\u2019t actually want to receive a notification for it. On iOS it\u2019s possible to have that notification stored on the notification center only and check it anytime.Another good example for this is my duolingo app: I want to do my daily exercise but I don\u2019t want to forget it. On One Plus I\u2019m forced to delete the app since I don\u2019t want to see a green row every time I\u2019m checking other notifications - this made me lose some training days. On iOS, I simply have it on the notification center.&#x200B;**Gaming mode:**\\- Gaming mode activates with a big pop up and on wrong apps: This is especially annoying when you are trying to check a match result and the pop up is blocking the score for some seconds and you have to stare at it while you wait.&#x200B;**Clipboard:**\\+ You can copy full paragraphs of text by pressing the text;\\- You can\u2019t copy full images to the clipboard: you have to download them, (get the notification while you\u2019re at it) and then send it as an attachment.&#x200B;**Chat preview:**\\- This is impossible to do on One Plus. You get a notification (that gets cut by the char cap) and you are forced to open the chat to read the conversation - on iOS, you can press a bit harder on the chat and you can see everything without anyone knowing.&#x200B;**Apps management:**\\- I got the notification \u201capp is consuming too much battery\u201d or \u201c*app* is running in background\u201d. Apps should be stopped when they aren\u2019t running.&#x200B;**Apps:**This point is not related with android directly but there were some apps were the experience was not as good as on iOS:\\- Forza: Football app, issues with gaming mode already mentioned;\\- Duolingo: You can\u2019t move words within a sentence, if you miss something in the beginning you have to re-write the whole sentence instead of just moving the word to the correct place;\\- WhatsApp: if you mute one chat you still receive notifications.**Misc:**\\-  Do not disturb and hot colors are the same option;\\-  Phone light, even with hot colors, is stronger than iOS which is worse for scrolling at bed;\\-  You can\u2019t remove gmail without root access;\\-  No native sleep timer feature:\\-> If you want to put a video on youtube with relaxing sounds and turn it off after 45 minutes, you can\u2019t - you can achieve this with spotify but hearing relaxing sounds or lo-fi music on Spotify will mess up your daily mixes;\\- Forza: Football app, issues with gaming mode already mentioned;\\- Duolingo: You can\u2019t move words within a sentence, if you miss something in the beginning you have to re-write the whole sentence instead of just moving the word to the correct place;\\- WhatsApp: if you mute one chat you still receive notifications;\\-  Keyboard has too many options visible;\\-  Native keyboard shows too many things when you select one emoji;\\-  No scroll feature for emojis;\\-  Search feature for emojis rarely works: On iOS I simply type \u201cfire\u201d and I get the emoji as a suggestion, this only works with some emojis on OnePlus.\\*\\*Conclusion:\\*\\*All in all it\u2019s a good phone but it lacks tons of quality of life improvements that iOS gave me throughout the years. The motto of Android is \u201cyou can do everything\u201d but I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not possible to remove gmail. You can remove mail - and most of native apps - on iOS. You can root your phone, install custom roms and do everything with your phone but, in my opinion, I would rather do this on a tablet or a raspberry pi.I look at a phone as an assistant and for that objective I prefer something that \u201csimply works\u201d instead of having to configure everything. I would also like to give an honorable mention to Apple ecosystem which lets me use AirPods and answer phone calls from my Macbook.&#x200B;**Disclaimer:** As I stated previously, I'm an iPhone user so there are some things that I might be wrong because I wasn't able to achieve the objective I was hoping for, this is especially true on the misc section.**TL;DR:** iPhone user likes iOS more than Android and believe iOS has more quality of life features. Might be wrong and feedback is appreciated.","463":"Hey guys, just wanted to share my personal experience with both worlds.**First smartphone:** *Samsung S Advance* \\- This sammy was my first Android smartphone, in the beginning it was very fast and met all my expectations. At the time it was running Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and after a very long time waiting it received Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and the last update was Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean). After a few months it started to close and crash apps out of nowhere, random resets, super annoying freezes that I had to remove the device battery to force reset. Frustrated I rooted and unlocked the bootloader and installed some custom roms from XDA, it worked for a bit, just in time for me to replace it. Lasted a year.>***PROS**** Lightweight;* Good enough camera;* Reasonable battery;* Super AMOLED display.>***CONS**** Weak CPU;* Samsung took too long for releasing Android updates;* After some months it started stuttering and lagging out of nowhere, closing apps, froze the entire device, incredibly frustrating.**Second Smartphone:** *LG Nexus 4 -* Probably the best Android smartphone I have ever had, it was blazing fast, no lags, no freezes, no apps closing in my face, updates direct from Google, no complaints whatsoever. The last update from Google was Android 6.0 (Marshmallow). It was my best experience with Android so far. In his \"final days\" I installed CyanogenMod to use Android 7.0 (Nougat) unofficially. Lasted almost two years.>***PROS**** Good CPU, RAM and storage;* Updates directly from Google;* Super stable and smooth experience;* Beautiful design (IMO).>***CONS**** Camera was not so great, it was ok;* Battery was average, didn't last a day;* LCD display.**Third Smartphone:** *Motorola Moto X2* \\- Wanting to continue using the Nexus family but not having the money (smartphones here in Brazil are no so cheap, and the economy at the time was starting to decline), I bough the Moto X2 because it claimed that it have a pure Android experience. Coming from a Nexus it was, at the time, the right thing to do. At the time, the camera was great, the AMOLED screen was so good, the front-facing speakers was awesome and the build quality was very good, just the battery was crap (2300 mAh if i'm not mistaken). But, after a year it started to lag and don't be so smooth as before, Motorola was delaying the updates and the USB-B port was starting to wear too much and started to fail, the device was shutting down with 30% battery so I finally installed CyanogenMod and after some time LineageOS (Android 8.0 Oreo). Lasted almost two years.>***PROS**** Good CPU, RAM and storage;* Android updates was fast, but not equal to the Nexus line;* Stable and smooth experience for a good time;* Good camera;* Front-facing speakers;* AMOLED display.>***CONS**** Battery life was crap;* After a year it started to lag and close apps;* USB port wore after some time.**Fourth Smartphone:** *Meizu MX6* \\- Short on money and not having Google selling the Nexus (or Pixel) line here on Brazil it was time to try the competitor of Xiaomi. Meizu was officially selling their smartphones in Brazil at a reasonable price. With a 10-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and a good camera I tough that it at least take two or three years for me to change to another smartphone. My mistake. After just six months it started to lag, freeze, close apps and do crazy stuff like camera not working, WhatsApp didn't work properly, only receiving my notifications when I opened the apps, it was a true nightmare. What all my Android smartphones took to start to lag and become not so good (except the Nexus 4), this piece of garbage started within six months! Tried everything (complete wipe, different rooms from Meizu (the bootloader was locked and it didn't have another room except for the officials)). Tired of all Android crap I had enough and after just one year after I bough it I tossed away that garbage and moved to my current smartphone.>***PROS**** Good camera;* Average battery life.>***CONS**** All the specs was worthless, it crashed the apps, could not leave apps running on background, apps not working properly and acting weird, A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!**Fifth and current smartphone:** *Apple iPhone 8 Plus* \\- Here in Brazil, Apple products are so expensive but I had no other choice other than to switch to an Apple device. I paid R$ 4.000,00 (freaking $ 1.100!) for my iPhone. For comparison Apple is selling the iPhone XS Max 256 GB for a unbelievable amount of R$ 8.799,00 (2.363 DOLLARS!). Anyway, it was the best decision I've ever made on my entire life! After a year or so it looks like new, as if it had just come out of the box brand new! Amazing battery life (one day and a half using 4G\/WiFi, playing casual games, browsing Instagram, Facebook, 9GAG, reddit and using WhatsApp). Not one single complaint about this device. Super fast updates, it never froze on my, never closed an app on my face, simply awesome!>***PROS**** Great camera;* Great battery life;* Gorgeous display;* Super fast and responsive, smooth af;* Super fast updates;* Not one single app froze\/lags\/close on me;* Water resistant (IP67);* Great support from Apple.>***CONS**** Lack of headphone jack;* LCD display (don't get me wrong, it's the best LCD display I've ever seen but it's my personal taste for OLED\/AMOLED);* Price.Leading me to the end of this topic. My reason to tell all my \"smartphone story\" to you guys is to have an healthy discussion, with no disrespects, rage or fanaticism. All my entire life I was an Android guy, defending the little green robot from Google, rooting and tweaking everything possible. But, after some time I grew tired of tweaking and rooting, doing things to try to have an good experience, with no lags, freezes or app crashes. For me, the device can have the best hardware available on the market but if the software isn't properly optimized, it will simply not use all the potential of the hardware and possibly frustrate the user.I have friends that have Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola (all flagships) and, although they don't assume, I can see that they smartphones do lag, freeze or close app some times. Unfortunately my experience with Android was not so great, and I see that even today with flagships are still occurring some flaws from years ago!So, tell to us your story and what is your preference!&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;","464":"Hey everyone! I know there are better phones coming around the corner, I just finished paying off my phone because my screen is ruined and my camera is cracked on my iPhone 7, definitely want to upgrade before a vacation I'm taking next month.I've always wanted a good reason to return to Android, I had the HTC G2 ages ago and loved it, but after I made the switch to iPhone and got really in the groove of using it I learned to enjoy iOS.The Pixel 2, honestly, blows my mind, I'll be honest. I really dig how smart it is, I love the photos it takes, and I think Android P looks really, really nice. Google assistant is an attractive feature to me, and as a designer having a much more intelligent phone with a killer camera sounds like a sweet deal.However, everyone around me is an iPhone user. I love group chats with iMessage, I use facetime all of the time. It sounds silly, but letting that go feels weird. iOS 12 is making my decision a lot more difficult as well, with a lot of features I was looking forward to on Android P being included (grouped notifications, limiting app usage, etc). I'm just bored with iOS - I feel like no matter how I arrange my apps, everything looks the same. Native app integration and navigation is meh at best, it's just not exciting.Any thoughts on which route I should stick to? I think my biggest concern with getting the Pixel 2 is interaction with iPhone users. Every member of my family, my friends, my girlfriend - they're all iPhone users. Has anyone jumped ship and had a positive experience?Thanks Reddit!","465":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","466":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","468":"I am very sad and disappointed to say that after trying a ton of flagship phones in the last two years  (S24+, Oneplus 11, iPhone 15 Pro Max, Xiaomi 13T Pro, Pixel 9) the best phones are the ones you expect are the best. Its Samsung or Apple at 1st place and Google at 2nd place then Oneplus 3rd then Xiaomi and the other Chinese brands. Lets get into some further points below:Performance: The smoothest and best performing phones were the iPhone, Samsung and Oneplus. The Xiaomi had hitching frequently, overheating and other weird stuff. Pixel usually stays smooth but once pushed shows that its an inferior chip.Display: Samsung. It offers the refresh rate promised consistently regardless of brightness ahem Oneplus and Apple with excellent specs ahem Google and an actually modernly good brightness ahem Xiaomi.Speakers: iPhone and Samsung. You will only understand when you put them side by side the others sound decent as well but are humiliated when set next to these two.Ecosystem: Apple clear first place, Xiaomi and Samsung second place. Apple is the king of continuity and fluidity between devices even if Samsung and Xiaomi are making their own attempts that are just not as polished in reality or are limited due to lack of good products in other product categories (Samsung horrid laptops, Xiaomi tablets dont ever make it to my country)Battery life: Apple and Samsung. Oneplus was good but went worse after some update, Pixel was pretty mediocre all around, Xiaomi is extremely unoptimized and gets completely destroyed on 5G data. Keep in mind Xiaomi also has explicitly hidden battery health statistics and protections which I find hideous.Automations\/Smart Device Management: Samsung and Apple have automations at the operating system level which make automating tasks and managing smart devices so much easier for advanced users like me. I hated the lack of this on the other phones and I will not settle for mediocre solutions such as Tasker or rooting personally.Software: I highly underestimated this during this journey but at the end it became rule #1. If the OS and software support sucks the experience sucks. Winners are Pixel, Samsung and Apple. Pixel is a click behind due to slip ups with bugs at times but should overall be a great experience, even if a little limited for power users.Hardware: Xiaomi. This is the real shame here. If Xiaomi put equal or 90% the effort they put in sourcing hardware into developing good software with ongoing support it would have been number #1 within one financial year. The reality is that the hardware looks good on paper but runs like shit in reality. For example my 13T Pro has autofocus issues, wifi stability issues, Bluetooth is extremely bad it just disconnects all the time, one update in six months, misleading display brightness, 50% worse performance on my unit, no in-country warranty if not bought from specific shops in my country. Thats when I realized that a Samsung A55 just offers a better experience even if literally inferior in specs and I pivoted.This is just my opinion from my recent two year experiences and I currently still own only the iPhone and Samsung, however I want to inspire conversation below of how do you guys feel about all that I discussed.","469":"I recently purchased a P9PXL to replace an aging iPhone 12 Pro Max and after a week of ownership, the P9PXL is being returned. I just wanted to spread the word in case my issues were hardware\/software batch or revision related so you know what you might experience and what to look out for. It seems like it is just not finished yet, like another few months of work could have really ironed out some major wrinkles.* The battery life was very poor (5 to 5.5 hours of screen-on time), though I realize a week isn't enough to \"teach\" it my habits. Regardless, this was not impressive, I don't play games or do anything intensive. * Wireless charging was just ***broken***. I've read a ton of Pixel forum and reddit posts and such where people are complaining that they can't get the device to properly charge wirelessly, even on Google wireless chargers. Mine worked on ZERO of my wireless chargers, and exhibited all of the same symptoms as the other posters. Apparently the Pixel engineering team is aware of the issue and is working on it, with no timeline for a fix.* The reception strength was weak. At the same location my 12PM got -100dBm, the P9PXL was getting -118dBm, and it was always worse by about -20dBm. It would essentially *never* connect to 5G UW, and the speeds it did get on LTE and 5G base were notably less than the 12PM, which could also still connect to 5G UW.* Bluetooth took a very long time to both pair and reconnect. Smart lights, headphones, etc would take 10-15 seconds or more to connect. * ***DELAYED GMAIL NOTIFICATIONS***: This is the worst offender, and apparently as I've learned, a Pixel staple issue. I depend on quick email correspondence for work and I was not getting push notifications when new emails came in. Sometimes I'd get them... 45 minutes after I'd received them. The forums are filled with this issue for *multiple generations of Pixel phones*, but they have no expected resolution as it may be due to Android's \"Doze\" idle power management.If none of these issues are of particular note to you, or if you want to be along for the ride as they fix them, it's a nice phone otherwise. Great screen, great haptics, loud speaker, etc. And maybe I got an early batch defective unit and you won't have these issues at all. I just figured it'd be nice to give a warning before you put down $1200 for something that is essentially a \"work in progress.\"","470":"My iPhone 12 Pro Max has served me well and will likely serve a family member well for a while after I choose a successor, but I'm interested in hearing real users opinions on the matter. **Skip my personal context below if you're not interested and just want to weigh in**, but I am specifically interested in hearing if Android has improved in stability since 2020 when I last owned an Android device. Personal anecdotes welcome. This would effect whether or not I'm willing to try going back to Android, and if the Pixel is the right choice to do so.*Here are some of my current thoughts\/context going into this:** *The main reason I tried the iPhone in the first place was because of how terribly unstable my Galaxy S9 and OnePlus 7T were before it. I'd owned 6 or 7 Android phones before the 12PM. Instead of unlocking bootloaders and finding ROMs to see if I could fix the phones' issues myself, I just got sick of it and wanted a phone that worked out of the box.** *I don't own many other Apple \"ecosystem\" devices, so that isn't really a big deal to me concerning switching OS's.** *Having seen it first hand, app developers really do favor iOS. The apps are sometimes night-and-day better for iPhone users.** *I don't play mobile games, so peak performance isn't much of an issue for me but I do recognize that it does help extend the device's lifespan into the future.** *The notifications on iOS are* ***atrocious***. Android nailed the swipe-down notification list and groupings a while ago, and Apple is too stubborn to steal it as of yet. I wish they would.* *You \\*still\\* can't set individual notification tones for different apps in iOS. This has bugged me for years.** *Battery life is important to me. When I travel, I don't always have a battery or wall plug available. This makes the 16 Pro Max especially appealing.** *Stable Bluetooth connectivity is very important to me.** *MagSafe is actually fantastic, but I think I can get a MagSafe compatible case for most well known Android devices.** *Having a way to monitor battery health is important to me. I have 88% battery health on my 12PM after 4 years of use. It's important here since the 12PM only had a \\~3600mAh battery to start with.*","471":"I\u2019m in the market for a new phone and having a hard time choosing! Right now I have an iPhone 7. Prior to that I had an iPhone, prior to that I had a Samsung, and nothing before that is worth mentioning because it was so long ago. I\u2019m looking to spend ~$300 and looking at refurbished phones. I just can\u2019t spend $700+ on a new phone. I\u2019m not loyal to either iPhone or Android. I\u2019ve used both easily. But I do like when I don\u2019t have to rewire my entire brain to use a new device. This is why I was thinking of sticking with iPhone. Google Pixels look interesting to me. I\u2019ve had recommendations of Pixels because they have great cameras and they sync to your existing Google account. Backups are easy. That\u2019s attractive to me. Right now I pay for Apple Cloud service. I would probably cancel it, and it seems like it would be a headache to save all my data and move it somewhere. I know it\u2019s a small headache, but it\u2019s a deterrent. I like the small size of the iPhone 7. Most phones are significantly larger, even the Pixel 6a and 7a. These are dumb considerations - I\u2019d have to get new charging wires and it seems like there aren\u2019t as many Pixel cases available. They seem more expensive and uglier. Having a better camera is important to me, but any newer phone has a better camera.I hated that when I went to iPhone, I was no longer able to record phone calls. That was useful to me back then. Now if I need to, I have to put it on speaker and record with a separate device. Do androids still allow call recording? Without notifying the other party?I hated that the iPhone 7 removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack. Now I\u2019m used to using Bluetooth earbuds, but I still hate it on principle. I thought some Android phones started putting them back in, but they seem few and far between.Battery life is fairly important to me, but I know all batteries degrade over time. Being able to have the battery replaced easily is a priority. The Apple store replaces iPhone batteries for $50 in one afternoon. Can you do that with Samsungs and Pixels?On my iPhone, it was really easy to configure the accessibility settings to make the screen very dim for the nighttime. The \u201cNight Shift\u201d setting kicks in automatically too. I find almost every screen to bright for my eyes. I just triple click the button and it dims significantly. It\u2019s important to me that my new phone allows something like that. It has to be just as easy. I found iPhone\u2019s ability to automatically adjust to the brightness of the environment much more intuitive than Samsung. Perhaps that has changed.I like the way the iPhone has the swipe up menu of icons that let me turn on the flashlight, change brightness, switch to camera, turn on do not disturb, pause music or skip ahead, etc etc. That menu is customizable.I dislike any phone that has a screen all the way to the edge, but with a piece cutout of the top. I want a rectangular screen.I saw that some Pixels don\u2019t allow you to turn off the camera shutter sound. That would be a dealbreaker for me, but it seems like only phones from certain countries overseas have that setting built in.I was initially frustrated by how iPhone doesn\u2019t allow you to customize much, but I\u2019ve gotten so used to it, I can\u2019t remember what specifically was annoying me. The main thing keeping me reluctant to change from iPhone is how utterly simple it was to switch phones last time. It kept every setting, every bit of data, down to all of my open tabs in the browser. It was so streamlined, it required no effort at all and blew my mind. I know there are apps that help you switch from iPhone to android, but even having to download an app is more steps than I want to do having experienced the smooth transition from iPhone to iPhone.Are there any overwhelming reasons to switch from iPhone to android? I\u2019ve been looking more at Pixels than Samsungs. I know there are other brands out there. Willing to check them out, but I\u2019d need to hear more about their benefits. Has anyone else been in the same boat struggling to choose a new phone? I plan to keep the phone for as many years as it keeps working, which is hopefully, I don\u2019t know, at least 3?I know I\u2019m rambling. Just wanted to highlight the things that are important to me.What phone do you recommend?","472":"Hey everyone,I'm in need of some advice on which smartphone to purchase. My main priorities are:- **Battery Life**: Need a phone with good autonomy.- **Camera\/Video Quality**: Looking for a device that takes good photos and videos.- **Software**: A smooth and reliable software experience.- **Heat Dissipation**: A phone that manages heat well during intensive use.- **Audio Quality**: High-quality audio output.- **Haptic Feedback**: Good haptic feedback is a must.Currently, I'm torn between the following options:1. **Honor 200 Pro**2. **Realme GT6**3. **Nothing Phone 2**4. **Oppo Reno 12 Pro**5. **Xiaomi 13 T Pro**For context, my current smartphone is an Oppo Find. Apart from the Nothing Phone 2, none of the other options excite me aesthetically, but aesthetics are not a deal-breaker for me.I'm particularly interested in understanding the pros and cons of each device based on the criteria mentioned above. Specifically, I would appreciate insights on:- Which phone offers the best camera and video quality?- Which device has the most reliable software experience?- How do these phones compare in terms of heat dissipation during heavy use?- Which one provides the best audio quality and haptic feedback?  Additionally, as a music enthusiast, it's important for me to know which of these smartphones has the best support for music. I'd also like to understand the substantial differences between Bluetooth 5.3 and 5.4. The memory needs to be greater than 256GB because I have a lot of music on my phone.Finally, I'm looking for the overall best option among these phones without considering the price, as they are all within a similar range for me. I just want the best performer in terms of the criteria listed.Thanks in advance for your help!","473":"Exactly that's what I mean. The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra launched last week and that phone is definitely Motorola's ace in the hole, their flagship device of 2024. The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra, is for the android person who is sick and tired hearing all the hype over the 3 flagship phones of the Samsung Galaxy S Series. Everyone knows that Samsung, and Apple as well, launch their flagship device series at the same time every year. The Samsung Galaxy S series has 3 variants which are the S, S+, and the flagship S Ultra. As for Apple they have the regular iPhone, iPhone Plus, iPhone Pro, and the iPhone Pro Max which actually makes 4 not 3. I do apologize for that small miscalculation.   The annual launch of the Google Pixel flagship series phones became interesting again in October of 2021 when the newly designed all new Pixel 6 series came out Google decided to take their smartphone game to the next level and start producing their own, in house, chipsets instead of using chips made by Qualcomm and Mediatek, which most Chinese android smartphone manufacturers primarily use. I started to get excited when I heard this news, but as we know starting your own SOC chipset is going to have its speed bumps. For example Samsung manufacturer their own chipset called the Samsung Exynos chips. Samsung Enxyos chipsets are only available on Samsung devices. Samsung makes the Exynos chips for it's own devices launched around the world. However in the USA Samsung goes with the Snapdragon 8 Series SOC for their S Series lineup. Exynos has always been outperformed by the Snapdragon chipset, but its getting better and better every year albeit so is Snapdragon's chipset. The Exynos 2400 comes closer to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, than it ever has before. Recently there was a rumor going around the android communtiy that testing of the Samsung Exynos 2500 was taking place and it was supposedly outperforming the early results of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SOC. Both of these chipsets are expected to be released in the last quarter of 2024, and they are going to be extremely fast, vibrant, and smooth with quite amazing battery efficency. Sorry I went on a tangent there lol The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra is also for the person who won't join the darkside and go over to the world of Apple. The person who has had a Oneplus, ZTE, and even an LG smartphone in the past and is familiar with each company's custom android skin and it's launcher\/software. An example of which would be like Oxygen OS is what Oneplus uses and Hello UI is what the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra uses and it's Motorola 's brand new UI as well. My experience testing this device went extremely well and I am highly impressed with the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra. It is an amazing flagship device that is definitely Motorola's best handset in the last decade.  The Edge 50 Ultra is the first Motorola flagship phone to have a 1.5K resolution display which is enabled with a refresh rate of 144hz. The phone can reach 2500 nits of peak brightness and can be easily seen outside in the direct sunshine. There was absolutely no problem viewing the content on the display in my time with it. The camera hardware is the best triple lens setup on a Motorola flagship device. It has a 50MP primary lens that is capable of shooting excellent detail with great depth of field. Thanks to Motorola's new advanced AI camera system is certified by Pantone to be color accurate and the display is also Pantone certified as well especially when it comes to natural skintones. The AI camera processing is spectacular and really do an excellent job of reducing any noise in the photos and it had the perfect amount of saturation in the details without going overboard most of the time. The Telephoto lens is magnificent and has an excellent optical zoom of 3X. Any photos taken from 10X and under will lose barely any detail at all thanks to the new AI software. The 50MP Ultrawide lens is also a great camera that produces some of the best ultra wide shots I have personally ever seen on a smartphone. The all new Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 is a fantastic beast of a processor and chugs away effortlessly even when multi tasking for hours. There is absolutely nothing you can throw at this processor that can challenge it in the slightest. Absolutely amazing heat control as well. After gaming for over 45 minutes straight the phone didn't get too hot at all just slightly warm around the rear camera bump. My 1 and only gripe with this phone is the size of the battery in this flagship device. Motorola put in a 4500 mAh battery into this phone when a 5000 mAh battery is more so the average size of any flagship device. They did have the decency to include up to 125W TurboPower charging whovh powers up the phone from dead to full in a mere 36 minutes. Unfortunately in the USA we can only charge devices as high as 80W due to the sockets themselves in the country not having the ability to produce anything higher than 80W. At least Motorola even includes the ability to use wireless charging at up to 50W, and it can even reverse charge at 10W! This more than makes up for the inclusion of a 4500 mAh battery even though last year the Edge 40 Pro had a 4800 mAh battery so that means a reduction in size of 300 mAh. After spending time reviewing the Edge 50 Ultra the battery lasted me st least the whole day if not more with a single charge, which definitely works for me.SPECS: DISPLAY: The Motorola Edge 50 Ultra has a 6.7\" Super HD or 1.5K resolution. The screen has a 20:8 aspect ratio. Super HD (2712p x 1220p) It has a 446ppi and a peak brightness of 2500 nits.  PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 Mobile Platform with 12GB or 16GB of RAM.  You have storage options of 512GB ROM or 1TB ROM. It also runs on android 14 with the new Hello UI from Motorola.  CAMERA: It has a 50MP primary lens with f\/1.6, 50MP Ultra Wide lens, and finally a 64MP Telephoto camera with 3X Optical Zoom with f\/2.4. It also has a front facing 50MP Selfie lens with f\/1.9.  BATTERY: It has a 4500mAh battery with 125W TurboPower charging and up to 50W wireless charging, and 10W reverse charging capabilities. AVAILABLE COLORS: Forest Gray(vegan leather) Peach Fuzz(vegan leather) Nordic Wood(actual wood)I highly recommend this phone if you are in the market for a new flagship and you have a budget of up to $1100. It is going to be released, some time in the summer of 2024, in the United States. It will be renamed the Motorola Edge Plus 2024 when it launches in the US. Considering you can't get many other smartphones from brands in China when you are living in the United States; then there are only a few choices of what else is available in the North American smartphone market to purchase as your daily driver. The only other 3 phones that I would consider along with the Motorola Edge Plus 2024 would be the Oneplus 12, Asus Zenfone Ultra, and the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra. ","474":"Currently using and exynos S22 Ultra with only 128GB.I don't like upgrading often, but ... I'm having some issues with this phone.- I do love the Spen and camera but that's basically it.-Phone fell a few months ago and the screen got damaged, still functional but I don't know untill when given certain comments I've been reading about dead pixels and the flickering on the screen. To repair it I'll have to pay 300\u20ac which really is a lot for a 2 year old phone and with these issues I've been having.-Perfomance is definitely lackluster for an \"Ultra\" phone. Always lags when using the camera and it's overall not consistent (it may be smooth sometimes and others it lags all over the place).-Battery is okay I guess but I work in office and will always have a charger with me so not a big deal for me personally.-One plus 12 is looking real sweet if I can buy it from Giztop or tradingshenzen which will cost me around 650\u20ac, plus I'll have way more memory given how low 128gb is nowadays and I have to constantly erase stuff on my phone (another disappointment, \"Ultra\" phones should have at least 256GB).-I also don't really like the direction Samsung is going, and after 10 years of using their devices maybe it's time for me to switch.What do you think? Will this be a stupid upgrade or a necessary one? Thank you for reading.","475":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","476":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them. Thank you for reading!https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6os3l9l2altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6fcdf4dd6f4d1aafd4fdccccb75bdca7235f407","477":"Hey folks, long-time Android user here with some thoughts I need to get off my chest. I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","478":"I'm using a Galaxy A40 rn and I'm generally happy with it, but the charging stops working randomly, so I'm looking for a new phone.I need a super reliable, compact phone with good battery life and a decent camera. After analyzing the market, I've narrowed it down to four options. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my needs.1. Samsung Galaxy S25Pros:- Best small form factor, super lightweight- Familiar UI, so I'll feel at home from the get-go- Well-balanced device with no major flawsCons:- after using Galaxy for 4 years, it's getting boring, and I\u2019d like to try something new2. Google Pixel 9 ProPros:- very appealing clean OS - Packed with AI features I plan to use for work- stellar camera experience-  by far the cheapest option where I liveCons:- Uncomfortably heavy (like the iPhone 16 Pro)- Pixel\u2019s notorious for poor heat management- Larger than the other options- Mixed battery life reviews3. Apple iPhone 16 ProPros:+ Best resale value over time (at least where I live)+ well optimized battery life+ camera that just works.+ probably the best heat managenent from the pack+ Always admired Apple and wanted to try oneCons:- as a lifelong Android user, I'm worried iOS would disrupt my productivity, making buying a new phone pointless since it's meant to be a work tool - quite heavy (like the Pixel)- Not interested in diving into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, except for this phone (I\u2019m a Linux user btw)4. Xiaomi 15Pros:+ Best battery life by far+ decent camera+ Compact and lightweight, smaller than the iPhone and Pixel+ Brand aligns with my values outside the prestige onesCons:- the OS is known to be bloated as hell, which is the last thing I want for my productivity- Likely poor long-term durability compared to others- chinese phones depreciate so fast that reselling doesn't make sense, forcing me to keep it until it diesOverall priorities:1. Battery life - Essential as I'm often on the go2. Reliability - I store important data and can't risk losing it if the phone breaks3. Compactness and weight - I just dislike big phones4. Good heat management - My Galaxies overheat during navigation or video calls, and I won\u2019t buy another phone with this issueThings I don\u2019t care about:1. Fast\/wireless charging2. Speaker quality3. Fingerprint sensor (I don\u2019t use it)4. Years of updates (I won\u2019t keep the phone more than 4 years)I decided not to focus on camera and CPU specs, as all the listed phones perform well in these areas. The Pixel and Galaxy have an AI advantage, but it\u2019s subjective.The S25 seemed like the best choice since it has everything. Then I considered the Pixel, praised for addressing overheating and battery issues. But if I\u2019m buying a 200g phone, I might as well get the iPhone, which has the same virtues without Pixel\u2019s flaws. Then there's Xiaomi, with great battery life and size, but the bloatware is nearly a dealbreaker.Please don't suggest the Vivo X200 Pro Mini (I'm not buying it from China) or OnePlus 13 (it's too big). Both are great, but not options for me.Lastly, there are many reviews online, but they focus mainly on performance and battery out of the box. For me, the more important factor is how the phones perform after 2-3 years of use.","479":"Hello everyone, I am currently in a search for my next phone as my current one ( OPPO A96 ) is showing signs of dying after not even 2 years ( randomly powering off, contacts not showing when I get a call, gets hot really fast , etc ) . I am tired of the ads that OPPO and Xioami put in their systems and default apps.Also, for me atleast, it seems that overall performance and camera degrade faster in Xiaomi and other similar brands ( Motorola, Huawei, etc. )My budget is (currently) somewhere around 600-650$ and was highly considering the following:\\- iPhone 13 Pro ( unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere brand new, just used )\\- iPhone 14 Pro ( same issue as the 13 Pro )And for the android side:\\- S24 ( although I am a bit unsure of the temperature  issues caused by exynos ) ( S23 in my country is more expensive than the S24 for some reason )\\- Google Pixel 9After seeing a few reviews, I really like the camera on the iPhone 13 Pro and the Google Pixel 9. The performance has to go to the iPhone ( also had the best temperature from what I've seen )I've also researched phones from Sony but like the Google phones they seem to have really focus on a great camera ( comparable to iPhone I'd say ) but left some areas in the dust, like CPU\/GPU performance.I want to get into photography and also video recording. I also would like to mention that I would ideally want a smaller phone (6.3 inches max, although this could also be considered big), and also a good screen.I am open to other suggestions and recommendations. Thank you for everyone that is willing to take their time in order to help.","480":"I\u2019m considering the OnePlus 13, Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Samsung Galaxy S24\/25 Ultra.

That being said, I have a Windows PC and I'm using many Google apps.Long story short: I switched back to iPhone.The 16 Plus is working very well, great performance and photos, and the battery life is really great BUT... now I find the user interface and the overall experience so boring. In addition, I hate not having a general gesture for going back and I'm missing GBoard a lot.Frankly I'm surprised... I was not thinking I would have missed Android, since while I was there I was often complaining about the lack of optimization for third-party apps, some bugs, and the fact that sometimes I had to tinker with APKs, configurations and all that jazz, instead of having something that _just worked_ well as with iOS (I had a Xiaomi Note 10 Lite, so maybe some issues were related to the MIUI).For the above reasons I'm considering buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL, since I've read rave reviews and I'd also like to have a vanilla Android experience.**Is there anybody that made the switch from iPhone 15\/16 to this model?** I'd be interested to know more about:* Battery life* Reception and call quality (5G)* GPS (I've seen some posts about people complaining about poor signal)* Photo quality: I'm keen on taking landscape photos in particular; I like the results of the \"Pixel treatment\" that I've seen and I'm wondering also how it scores in low-light\/night contexts* Performance: did you notice any lag or stutter during daily activities? Any bugs?* Overheating issues?* Every Gemini\/AI feature is available also outside US?N.B. I've always used a 60hz display thus 120hz is not a deal-breaker for me.Thanks  a lot!","482":"Has anybody recently purchased a Boost Mobile phone line with phone(I got the IPhone 13 )(I was approved for the $149 price) and then after the fact have your bank account ravaged by a company named ACIMA.  I walked into Boost and said I want the $65 unlimited plan with that phone, pointing at it. Got approved for the phone, had my line turned on, went on my way. Third month leaving store. I have now become aware that I purchased the phone for $500 plus dollars to be paid off in a short term lease at aggressive payments coming out my bank weekly. The fundamental problem here as I see it, I never gave ACIMA access to my bank( I saw the payments coming out weeks ago and figured , don\u2019t know you, click, reported it as fraud to my bank)Also they say well I signed an agreement to this. I\u2019ve never heard of ACIMA in my life, I certainly also did not pick between their Short Term Pay off agreement or their Long Term Pay Off Agreement( here the bummy IPhone 13 will cost me $1300) The third issue here is, the Boost Manager in that store that day did not say a word about what I was getting into. Yes I signed a paper that she printed out out of her computer. You sign a paper at any provider with a new phone. This situation is UNETHICAL in the worse way. And then , may I add, the first few weeks when I reached out to ACIMA to stop sending me emails about money , 3 phone calls, they could not locate my \u201caccount\u201d to do anything about clearing me out their system. Any advice how to go about this. My bank could only stop the payments at the time. But good chunk was taken out before I stopped it. I\u2019m sending this phone back. ","483":"Whenever we go to a shopping mall and enter a clothing store, we need clarification about which shirt, jacket, trousers or wearable should be purchased. Then we see something attractive and, after seeing the price tag, realise that It doesn\u2019t fall in the budget. We go through all those clothing stores and choose what is perfect for us and whether it falls within our budget.The same goes for our smartphones. We look through many smartphones, and the internet shows you many brands with different models and pricing, ranging from lowest to highest. Then, some ads appear on our feed, and we consider our choice and need more clarification.So which smartphone should you buy?A good smartphone that fulfils all your needs can be done by a mid-range smartphone, too. There\u2019s no need to buy the flagship\/expensive phone and break your budget.*Buy a Smartphone which you need not the one which a smartphone company want you to buy.*Let's know, how you can purchase your smartphone smartly.First, look at your budget. If budget isn\u2019t your problem, then go for the smartphone according to your needs. You may be looking for a good camera quality, a high processor, a good battery, a high-resolution display or it can be any.If your budget is limited then you can\u2019t expect to have all the features which you want. You may have to compromise a bit.So what are the minimum features should a mid-range phone have (15000 Rs\u201325000 Rs)It should have at least 6 GB of RAM and a minimum of 128 GB of internal storage.It should have a good camera quality.It should have at least 3+ years of security updates.It should have a good processor to perform games like COD smoothly at the highest graphics settings.It should have an AMOLED display. If not, then a 120 Hz refresh rate LCD display.5G.Build quality.That smartphone company should have good customer support.It should have a service centre in your city or nearby.These overall are the decent features a mid-range phone can have and fulfil a customer's requirements.If all those features don\u2019t matter, and you only need a smartphone to call, send texts and watch YouTube, then go for a smartphone around or below 10,000. Make sure you are getting at least these features in your smartphone.Minimum 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage.A decent processor.At least 2 years of security updates.A decent camera quality.5G.Latest Android version.These are enough features for a low-priced smartphone.If you come in the category of those who don\u2019t have any budget issues and can spend any amount on a smartphone for the best features like a high-quality camera, security, low latency, high performance, build quality, smooth performance, a high-quality display and great software then go for premium and flagship phones like iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, etc.You will get high camera quality, security, efficient software, powerful processors, and smooth and quality display in these phones, but few models may disappoint you with low battery power, colour grading, degraded camera quality and heating issues. Most of the premium and flagship phones won\u2019t disappoint you.But you won\u2019t feel any issues while playing high graphics games on these phones as they can give you a high experience with powerful processors, capturing stunning shots and smooth scrolling. The low latency for tasking puts the performance at an amazing level.Apple, which comes with its Bionic chip, makes the iPhone so powerful and smooth to use.Many of you wonder how a budget phone with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of Internal storage is cheaper than a flagship phone with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage.The thing is the 6 GB RAM of a flagship phone is more powerful than a budget phone with even 12 GB of RAM because of the software and the the components used to optimise the RAM.The technology used in making those RAMs for flagship phones has high-performance components. A flagship phone is designed so that its software doesn't have bloating apps. It is highly optimised for that specific model and hardware. The powerful processors like the Snapdragon premium series, Samsung\u2019s Exynos and Apple\u2019s Bionic chip let the RAM work efficiently. These phones come with UFS 3.1 storage which makes the loading speed efficient and reduces the latency.I hope this blog has helped you to know about which smartphone you should buy. Purchase the phone which you need and don\u2019t break your budget forcefully if you can\u2019t manage to buy an expensive phone.There\u2019s no need to buy an expensive phone if your need is getting completed with a mid-range phone.Choose what\u2019s best for you!","484":"Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been a solely Apple user. Never used any other brands for smartphones and laptops, just Apple. Lately I\u2019ve been contemplating on switching sides because people I know who use brands such as Samsung and especially Pixel have told me that they\u2019ve also been avid Apple customers and took the leap of faith and had amazing results. Of course you each their own but I can\u2019t really stand the staleness of Apple, products are slinging but it\u2019s all getting slower. For 2024 alone I witness my iPhone 13 start from 100% battery health to 85 in a matter of 7-9 months. Mind you, I only use phones for calling and texting. So if anyone has experiences with Samsung or Pixel, please let me know. I\u2019m more intrigued by Google Pixel more so than anything else, thanks. ","485":"At the moment I'm posting this I'm on an S23 Ultra, I really like the phone, the size, the liberty it gives you, I also have a galaxy tab s9 (adding this info because basically I have the Samsung ecosystem).I've used iPhone in the past, I had the iPhone 12, the 14 plus and I really loved them, but I got the opportunity to change to samsung and I do enjoy it don't get me wrong but I kinda miss icloud how it works seamlessly with the notes app, the photos as well, samsung has a good camera and also de 100x zoom but regular photos compared to an iPhone you can definitely notice the difference (I'm not a big camera guy but even I notice) .Ive seen a lot of videos and posts and they all have the same conclusion, that iPhone only is best to samsung with the whole ecosystem, but I would need to buy more and more devices that are more expensive that samsung's.Also my whole family is on apple so there's a few things I miss, messages, facetime.I can live without the whole ecosystem, but I really really miss icloud, at the moment I'm paying for Google One but it's not the same.So what are your thoughts? Should I stay on samsung or go back to apple?","486":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

But I\u2019ve found myself in a bit of a dilemma lately when it comes to choosing between Android and iOS. I don\u2019t want to start another Android vs iOS debate, but this time, I\u2019m genuinely torn because I like and dislike both systems for very different reasons.For context, I\u2019m not the type of person who blindly follows a particular brand just because of its marketing. I prefer to choose based on what works best for me, regardless of the company behind it. I own an Asus laptop, LG monitors, Sony headsets, and Logitech peripherals, just to name a few. However, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that the iPhone is the best-selling phone on the planet, so I figured there might be something to it and decided to give it a shot.I\u2019ve been using Android phones for over 7 years, but I only started looking at Apple after the iPhone X was released. My first iPhone was the XS Max, and that\u2019s when I started thinking, \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to go back to Android.\u201d Initially, I felt it was a steep learning curve, but once I got the hang of iOS, I realized just how fluid and consistent it was. The animations, design, and overall user experience made everything feel seamless. The apps were better optimized, and the things I needed to do on my phone took less time, making it a joy to use.But as time went on, I realized that iOS wasn\u2019t changing that much. It\u2019s been stable, reliable, and predictable, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it made me feel like I wasn\u2019t getting that \u201cwow\u201d factor when I upgraded to a new iPhone. It\u2019s like buying a new iPhone, and it feels like the same experience from 5-6 years ago - solid, but not exciting anymore. That\u2019s when I started to get bored.Then, I had the chance to play around with a Galaxy S25 Ultra in-store for a few days, and I was genuinely impressed. I decided to take the plunge and bought one, and I have to admit, for the first time, I felt like an Android phone was outperforming an iPhone in terms of raw performance. The Galaxy S25 Ultra felt faster, more feature-packed, and customizable. However, it still wasn\u2019t as consistent as iOS. The apps I use most are still better on iOS, and even though Android offers a ton of features, I find myself using fewer of them than expected. Some actions feel like they take an extra step compared to iOS - nothing major, but those small details make a difference.Now, I\u2019m left in a tough spot. After using both, I can\u2019t choose a side. I\u2019m selling both my iPhone and Galaxy, and I\u2019ll just keep whichever one sells last. Have any of you ever gone through something similar? Struggling to pick the right device because both have their strengths and weaknesses?","488":"I currently have the Honor Magic 6 Lite and I am not looking to change it just yet. I am happy with the phone it is very good for the price. However, I am saving up for a new one and I am debating on what to buy next. I own a pretty even mix of devices (Apple & Android) and in terms of OS I can't say I have. A preference. I do enjoy both and do adapt to a new OS pretty seamlessly. All of my subscriptions are mostly through Google play. I have had all sorts of phones in the past:-iPhone 4 (awful), iPhone 8 (really good and lasted 6 years), iPhone 12 (awful).I have 2 Samsung phones from the Galaxy A series. 1 I loved and was better than the iPhone 12 but it needed replacing after 18months as it was constantly crashing. I bought the newer version and it was horrible and again needed changing after about 12 months. That's when I switched to Honor. I don't want to be spending more than \u00a3700 on a phone really. I know high end models usually have a poored battery than mid range and budget. I am considering the following:-iPhone 15 or 16.Google Pixel 8 or 9 either pro or standard versions. The upcoming Samsung Galaxy s25. I use my phone for the basic tasks, don't take many photos, I don't play games and I don't have social media accounts. I just us it for shopping and browsing and messaging and YouTube. I just want a battery that will last all day. I currently have the Honor Magic 6 Lite which has performed well and I do like it, but the camera isn't the best and I don't think it is that reliable regarding notifications. I am also not sure about switching everything over from Google Play to App Store. That might be a pain.I've also debated to keep an Android phone and invest in an iPad to replace my Samsung one which is starting to struggle. ","489":"Hi guys! :) I am looking to get a new phone and I am very swayed to pick an Android phone but I am struggling to choose one. Sorry in advance if this has some technical mistakes or sounds a bit dumb, I have only recently started my research and in all honestly I only had 2 phones and I used each for quite some time. I used my iphone SE 1 for 7 years and my iphone 11 pro for 5-6 years. So I am mainly looking for a phone that can be durable, I want it to be able to take good pictures (including selfies), have a good lasting battery and be able to run something like genshin for like 30 minutes every few days (not that often, im not an avid gamer, I just like to distract myself every now and then) without killing the phone.\u00a0I am currently using my iphone 11 pro which has really aged and its lagging a lot. I do not really want another iphone because I dont see the purpose of paying roughly 1100 euros (thats the price in my country) for a phone that is almost identical to mine with a slightly better camera. The iphone 16e is a complete disaster so I really am not seeing the purpose in iphones right now.\u00a0Budget wise I would prefer to stay below 700-850ish, unless the phone is crazy worth it. I have checked out trading Shenzen and the prices are nice and the options are great and a few phones have peaked my interest.I have looked at Xiaomi 14 and I really like how compact it is, I like the camera quality (I tested it out in a store a little bit) and I like the fact that the battery should last long and in general it should be quite a powerful compact device. What is swaying me is the fact that many people say that the battery apparently is not that good after a few months and the bloatware amount is insane. Is this true ?\u00a0Next phone that I was looking for was Vivo x200 pro. It was on many peoples tech reviews and it has an insane camera, as a device it is quite powerful too it seems and many people are satisfied with the overall performance. What concerned me and kind of demotivated me to look further into it was the selfie camera. It was very blurry and for the price of the phone it disappointed me.\u00a0I have scrolled on reddit and I saw many people recommend pixel 9 (pro?) and I have seen this phone blow up on tiktok in summer because every second influencer was sent this phone and they kept advertising it. I saw that the camera is really nice but thats all I saw I dont know much about it. Is the battery good? Can it run a game like Genshin for a bit? Is it worth it ? (because the prices are a bit high now and I know its a relatively new phone but I wanna know whether the price is worth the quality they offer)This will sound random but while scrolling on trading shenzhen I stumbled upon Xiaomi Mix Flip but I have no experience in flip phones and none of the people I know have it so I dont know much about it (and there are not many reviews about this specific phone either). Should I even consider it because I have seen many people complain that the crease on flip phones gets really bad and that it doesnt perform well?And I have one question for you guys. I was curious how \"optimized\" these phones are for social media like instagram? I only use instagram and occasionally post a few stories, I wanted to know if it ruins the quality of the pictures (its not a deal breaker in my case, just curiosity because I often hear people complain about social media optimization)I am open to any other models\/brands and I would be very very grateful if you guys could give me your opinions on a phone I could get. Perhaps some of you have experiences with the phones I listed or perhaps you see what I want and know exactly what phone has it, any form of input would be incredibly appreciated!  Thank you so much in advance !! :))","490":"Hello everyone, I am currently in a search for my next phone as my current one ( OPPO A96 ) is showing signs of dying after not even 2 years ( randomly powering off, contacts not showing when I get a call, gets hot really fast , etc ) . I am tired of the ads that OPPO and Xioami put in their systems and default apps.Also, for me atleast, it seems that overall performance and camera degrade faster in Xiaomi and other similar brands ( Motorola, Huawei, etc. )My budget is (currently) somewhere around 600-650$ and was highly considering the following:\\- iPhone 13 Pro ( unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere brand new, just used )\\- iPhone 14 Pro ( same issue as the 13 Pro )And for the android side:\\- S24 ( although I am a bit unsure of the temperature  issues caused by exynos ) ( S23 in my country is more expensive than the S24 for some reason )\\- Google Pixel 9After seeing a few reviews, I really like the camera on the iPhone 13 Pro and the Google Pixel 9. The performance has to go to the iPhone ( also had the best temperature from what I've seen )I've also researched phones from Sony but like the Google phones they seem to have really focus on a great camera ( comparable to iPhone I'd say ) but left some areas in the dust, like CPU\/GPU performance.I want to get into photography and also video recording. I also would like to mention that I would ideally want a smaller phone (6.3 inches max, although this could also be considered big), and also a good screen.I am open to other suggestions and recommendations. Thank you for everyone that is willing to take their time in order to help.","491":"Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more \"dedicated\" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one exampleAs such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses*** **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as \"pointless and gimmicky\" and \"flawed,\" with its accuracy being \"horrific\". The software is still in development for the button.* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a \"Frosty glass\" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra*** **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone\u2019s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around \u00a31,199\/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of \u00a31,249\/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL*** **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a \"pure\" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem*** **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple\u2019s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android\u2019s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google\u2019s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem\u2019s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come.","492":"This is the first time I am planning to buy a flagship mobile phone. My budget is 60-65k INR max. What I look for:Best camera at the price range. I love mobile photography and want to improve on that hobby. Not a selfie guy. I take pics of nature, scenary and love night photography and macro photography Storage: 512GB coz no SD card slots anymore.RAM: 12gb or more Processor: snapdragon 8 for this rangeBattery: reasonable to last one day for moderate usage and fast charging.OS - not that important as long as it is smooth without much bloatware (atleast options to remove them) and customisation options like themes would be nice. Screen size: compact. Snaller the better with decent dpi.I'm not into mobile games. The most I'd be engaged in would be the camera on weekends and social media. I like to watch shows and YouTube and listen to music. Last bu not least, Service: I need a brand that offers reliable after sale service. Also I intend to use it for atleast 4 years. So need a phone that can last long with regular maintenance.The choices I came across:Samsung S24 or 23: I have been using Samsung M31 for almost 4 years now. It was stable for most of it. Never had any technical issues. But I am fed up with the one UI and samsung OS. It's bland imo. So not interested in Samsung S24 or 23. Also they're atleast 10k to 20k over my budget. Iphone: They don't offer much in my price range unless I mive down a couple of versions. Also storage not enough and I can't side load apps. Pixel 8: doesn't offer 512GB storage. And I've heard it has software issues and connectivity issues. Also service centre is hard to find in my part of the country. Xiamoi 14 : it is promising and have more than what I ask for. And xiaomi promise 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates. The reviews so far is very positive.But I'm not sure if 14 would be durable in the long run OnePlus 12: it comes  in par with Xiaomi 14. Outranks it in a few aspects like battery and performance. Reviews are good. But I've oneplus can have problems in the long run too. If you're a xiaomi 14 or OnePlus 12 user, please share your insights. Also suggest me any alternatives I have misssed here. Thank you all. ","493":"Hello.I'm having a dilemma about my next phone and as I'm not as knowledgeable in the field of smartphones I've decided to get help from you guys. Basically I am looking into buying a new phone to replace my Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro as I feel like the device is a bit dated. All I've had until now were Xiaomi phones and my only experience with Apple products is my Ipad pro, which I quite like.I use my phone mainly for browsing internet, social media consumption, reading if I don't have my ipad with me and occasional basic outdoor photography.So my requirements are not very high, What I want:long SW supportgood HW and build quality so it doesn't feel sluggish after 2\/3 years (+good enough repairability) So I was thinking about instead of buying lower midrange phone I'd spend a little more for a device which would last me a long time. Are the flagships worth it longevity wise?My budget is around 800-900 euros.From reading a bunch of reviews I've picked in no particular order: (correct me if i'm wrong in any of my points and if you have better suggestion I'm all for it :)iPhone 15* Already have a device from them which I use on daily basis (What benefit would I get from ipad+iphone combo? I use icloud for my notes backups rest goes to paid google drive)* very good SW support* finally USB-C altho only 2.0* better optimized appsSamsung Galaxy S24* 120 hz display (would be nice to have for smoothness)* better HW specs compared to pixel* SW support of 7 years? (Can we believe Samsung delivers on its promise? Do they have a track record or just a promise? Can it keep up HW wise?)* USB-C 3.2Google Pixel 8*  SW support of 7 years? (Can we believe Google delivers on its promise? Do they have a track record or just a promise? Can it keep up HW wise?)* Pure Android (would be nice not to have bunch of apps I don't use from the manufacturer)* 150-200 euros cheaper* 120 hz display* USB-C 3.2I was also looking at FairPhone 5 as it's very easy to repair, but specs are not quite there for the price. Or would it be better for me just to wait until the EU repairability mandate kicks in and buy device then?Thank you ","494":" I have to make a decision: to stay with Android or try iOS for once in a lifetime.  Until now I have always had smartphones with Android (in the order Samsung Omnia HD, HTC Desire, Galaxy S5, and the current one, Google Pixel 3a).  Since my father would like to change his phone and I would give him mine, I have the opportunity to replace him.  Furthermore, I never liked the stock Android interface very much indeed, but I'm not even a person who installs various launchers to customize it, on the contrary, I think that customization is now the last thing that interests me, despite years ago on ' HTC Desire I tried practically all the existing custom roms, and then went back to the stock version because it was free of defects.  I am undecided between an iPhone 12 or a Galaxy S21, I know it is a considerable expense but I intend to keep the device as long as possible.  I've never had anything from Apple in my life, I've always heard of them and I've used some of their products sporadically, especially MacOS from High Sierra onwards.  The thing that holds me back in taking an iPhone is that I find Bixby more complete as a voice assistant and the same goes for the automations possible with Samsung (even if I have never tried them in the field).  Furthermore, as it is made, the Apple store seems more chaotic than the Android one, but it is certainly just a matter of habit.  Another thing holding me back from switching is the lack of an always on display feature on the iPhone, which I find very useful and which I exploit quite a lot.  On the other hand Samsung does not drive me crazy because I find it intolerable to use applications like Samsung Healt that have inside advertising banners, for this I do not compromise.  Consider that I also look at Windows 10 wrong when it offers me to install certain applications (functionality that I disabled as soon as I installed it).  I had read that IOS 15 could bring the always on display also on the iPhone but I would say that if it happens it will be from iPhone 13 onwards ....  In short, I'm quite indecisive.  I realize they are trifles, but I personally pay attention to them.  In other hands I still hate Samsung for some choices made, I also don't like the fact that I have dual applications on the phone, such as two galleries (Google and Samsung), two voice assistants (Assistant and Bixby), two browsers (Samsung Internet and Chrome), two email clients (samsung mail and Gmail) and two digital payment methods (Samsung Pay and Google Pay).  It must be said that they can be disabled and from a certain point of view it is called \"choice\".  Another thing to say about Samsung is the removal of the MST sensor which was the thing that made it possible to use it pretty much anywhere. Reading around the reason is because more and more POSs support NFC and make the use of MST superfluous.  But after this change, I see no reason to use Samsung Pay rather than Google Pay. Really, if anyone has this answer I would like to hear it. I'm not argumentative, but I'm curious.  But on the other hand, I have more things at home that would bind to the Samsung ecosystem, in fact from what I know its applications integrate very well with Windows 10 after the partnership with Microsoft, which makes them recover some ground towards the Apple ecosystem.  I have an Xbox Series S and a Samsung TV at home, in short, let's say that I somehow already live in the Samsung \/ Microsoft ecosystem, here is another reason that makes me hesitate.  In short, the desire to try \"the competition\" is great, but my rational part tells me that perhaps it is better not to do it, at least for the moment, while the more enterprising one tells me to throw myself and try. At most I can resell it because the positive thing is that over time the devaluation is less than for android smartphones in general.  And as you rightly said, Apple's support as software updates over time is much longer and better than any other, which makes your purchase much more valuable and this is by no means a trivial matter.  There are a couple of other things that make me really mad about Apple are these:  Speaking of MacOS, the calendar widget in Big Sur cannot be synchronized with the calendar application. What does it mean? That once the widget is shown, I can't see at a glance if I have any commitments on a given day, if they had for example put a red dot on the days when I have a commitment it would have been a welcome thing and I think more intuitive.  Another thing: in Apple Maps the street where my parents live is written wrong. I reported this to Apple via two friends' iPhones and it was never corrected. In the street name there is an extra \"i\" at the end of the word.  I know these are little things too, but from devices that aim to be excellence both in price and in software, I think these little things make a difference and given the price I really struggle to pass them on.  Last thing always inherent to MacOS: but is it possible that QuickTime still cannot play all video formats? Some MKVs don't want to play them, while Windows Media Player works with just about everything.  I know there is VLC but the speech I just made is always valid.","495":"I've been using Samsung flagships exclusively for over 13 years and used to be pretty biased against other brands. But recently, I've started feeling a bit frustrated with Samsung\u2019s direction focusing mainly on AI while treating their other flagships like budget models.I'm not planning to switch right now since I'm happy with my S23U, but I\u2019m considering my options for the future. The main reason is through my job, I get a discount on Apple products and can redeem points for Apple Gift Cards, but I need to decide by the end of the year or lose them.What I'm Looking For:- Not interested in Chinese phones (just don\u2019t like their UI\/phone design).- I don\u2019t game (mostly to save battery).- Used to love customization as a teenager, but now prefer a minimal setup.- Sometimes too many settings feel overwhelming\u2014I just want a smooth experience.- Primary usage: Cameras, normal phone tasks, music, and social media.- I like the minimalism of iPhones, the accessories ecosystem, and their battery life.I live in the EU, so iMessage and FaceTime aren't really a big deal for me. Only some people around me use iPhones.I\u2019d only stick to Samsung, switch to iPhone, or maybe consider a Pixel. I don\u2019t care about having the absolute best specs (like Chinese phones have on paper), I just want a premium phone that feels polished. My friend kept switching between iPhones and Samsung until she finally decided to stick with iPhones because she prefers them.For those who used premium Android phones for a long time but switched to iPhone, what made you stay?(Not looking for answers from people who switched back to Android, I\u2019ve already read a lot of those stories).","496":"Hey everyone,I\u2019ve been using an iPhone 12 Pro for the past 4 years, and it\u2019s starting to show its age. The battery health is down to 76%, and the speakers aren\u2019t working anymore. Repairing it would cost around \u20b98,000, but I feel like it\u2019s time for an upgrade instead of patching it up.Now, I\u2019m stuck between two options:-iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2013 Feels like a safe choice since I\u2019m already in the Apple ecosystem.-Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2013 Looks tempting with that insane camera and customization options.I mostly use my phone for photos, social media, and just 1-2 games\ud83d\udc49 If you\u2019ve switched from iPhone to Samsung (or vice versa), how was the experience?\ud83d\udc49 Which one would you recommend for long-term value and performance?Looking forward to your thoughts!","497":"Hello, I'm a student living in germany and looking to buy a decent and reliable (preferably) iphone to build an ecosystem. I also own a macbook air m1 (2020) and an ipad 9th gen (2021) which have offered a great value without having to be upgraded after every few years.Given that, I currently use an android, specifically the OnePlus Nord Ce 2 lite (2022), which has been a great performer for its sub 200\u20ac price. Naturally wanting to upgrade, I feel it'd be great to do so while also having an entry into the apple ecosystem. My current budget is around 600\u20ac and have gone through several options like a used 15 pro, used 16 (upwards of ~675\u20ac), new\/used 15 (650\/600\u20ac). I had been waiting for the SE4\/16e but the pricing vs. value just doesn't make sense to me.The key areas in which I'm looking an upgrade are: 1) good cameras (not having to use gcam),2) a decent battery for non-intensive daily use (5-6h of SoT),3) atleast a few OS upgrades (haven't had the best experiences with androids like oneplus, asus, motorola etc.),4) a compact size and decent in-hand feel which won't be a fingerprint magnet (~6.1\/6.2\")5) a smooth user experience (snapdragon 695 is definitely showing its age),6) usb-c (so the 14 pro doesn't really make sense).7) *Edit: good haptics (I've tried the pixel 9 and the haptics were great, don't know how it compares to apple though)I'm aware that features like an always-on display, higher charging speeds, 120hz, dedicated telephoto lens are going to be the trade-offs but are they a deal breaker for someone upgrading from a series of cheap\/budget android phones? Even though I feel the galaxy S24 (~640\u20ac for 256gb) is cheaper and overall superior in terms of how much functionality a phone (along with its os) can offer, but is it enough to offset the convenience that an ecosystem can bring?PS: I've never used\/owned an iphone before.","498":"I'm using a Galaxy A40 rn and I'm generally happy with it, but the charging stops working randomly, so I'm looking for a new phone.I need a super reliable, compact phone with good battery life and a decent camera. After analyzing the market, I've narrowed it down to four options. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my needs.1. Samsung Galaxy S25Pros:- Best small form factor, super lightweight- Familiar UI, so I'll feel at home from the get-go- Well-balanced device with no major flawsCons:- after using Galaxy for 4 years, it's getting boring, and I\u2019d like to try something new2. Google Pixel 9 ProPros:- very appealing clean OS - Packed with AI features I plan to use for work- stellar camera experience-  by far the cheapest option where I liveCons:- Uncomfortably heavy (like the iPhone 16 Pro)- Pixel\u2019s notorious for poor heat management- Larger than the other options- Mixed battery life reviews3. Apple iPhone 16 ProPros:+ Best resale value over time (at least where I live)+ well optimized battery life+ camera that just works.+ probably the best heat managenent from the pack+ Always admired Apple and wanted to try oneCons:- as a lifelong Android user, I'm worried iOS would disrupt my productivity, making buying a new phone pointless since it's meant to be a work tool - quite heavy (like the Pixel)- Not interested in diving into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, except for this phone (I\u2019m a Linux user btw)4. Xiaomi 15Pros:+ Best battery life by far+ decent camera+ Compact and lightweight, smaller than the iPhone and Pixel+ Brand aligns with my values outside the prestige onesCons:- the OS is known to be bloated as hell, which is the last thing I want for my productivity- Likely poor long-term durability compared to others- chinese phones depreciate so fast that reselling doesn't make sense, forcing me to keep it until it diesOverall priorities:1. Battery life - Essential as I'm often on the go2. Reliability - I store important data and can't risk losing it if the phone breaks3. Compactness and weight - I just dislike big phones4. Good heat management - My Galaxies overheat during navigation or video calls, and I won\u2019t buy another phone with this issueThings I don\u2019t care about:1. Fast\/wireless charging2. Speaker quality3. Fingerprint sensor (I don\u2019t use it)4. Years of updates (I won\u2019t keep the phone more than 4 years)I decided not to focus on camera and CPU specs, as all the listed phones perform well in these areas. The Pixel and Galaxy have an AI advantage, but it\u2019s subjective.The S25 seemed like the best choice since it has everything. Then I considered the Pixel, praised for addressing overheating and battery issues. But if I\u2019m buying a 200g phone, I might as well get the iPhone, which has the same virtues without Pixel\u2019s flaws. Then there's Xiaomi, with great battery life and size, but the bloatware is nearly a dealbreaker.Please don't suggest the Vivo X200 Pro Mini (I'm not buying it from China) or OnePlus 13 (it's too big). Both are great, but not options for me.Lastly, there are many reviews online, but they focus mainly on performance and battery out of the box. For me, the more important factor is how the phones perform after 2-3 years of use.","499":"So\u2026. Like a lot of people I\u2019m sure Apple has gotten me into their ecosystem for over 10 years now at this point, I\u2019ve had phones, tablets, watches, laptops, smart speakers - gotten rid of some of these over the years but I\u2019ve constantly every 2 years gotten the new iPhone that has come out that SeptemberI\u2019m currently using the iPhone 15 Pro and this September I\u2019m due for an upgradeThe price of these iPhone are bloody expensive as we know and I was just thinking\u2026.i only really use my iPhone for social media, taking photos and videos of my life and my family, play the occasion game and that\u2019s probably about itThe Apple Intelligence features are cool but I can honestly say none of them have benefited me in any way in my life - I\u2019m sure they benefit a lot of people but not me personallyAnd I\u2019m paying a lot of money each money for this phone so I\u2019m sure I can find another which I could still use In the past if anyone asked me about moving to android my answer would have been no way!

I am happy with the phone it is very good for the price. However, I am saving up for a new one and I am debating on what to buy next. I own a pretty even mix of devices (Apple & Android) and in terms of OS I can't say I have. A preference. I do enjoy both and do adapt to a new OS pretty seamlessly. All of my subscriptions are mostly through Google play. I have had all sorts of phones in the past:-iPhone 4 (awful), iPhone 8 (really good and lasted 6 years), iPhone 12 (awful).I have 2 Samsung phones from the Galaxy A series. 1 I loved and was better than the iPhone 12 but it needed replacing after 18months as it was constantly crashing. I bought the newer version and it was horrible and again needed changing after about 12 months. That's when I switched to Honor. I don't want to be spending more than \u00a3700 on a phone really. I know high end models usually have a poored battery than mid range and budget. I am considering the following:-iPhone 15 or 16.Google Pixel 8 or 9 either pro or standard versions. The upcoming Samsung Galaxy s25. I use my phone for the basic tasks, don't take many photos, I don't play games and I don't have social media accounts. I just us it for shopping and browsing and messaging and YouTube. I just want a battery that will last all day. I currently have the Honor Magic 6 Lite which has performed well and I do like it, but the camera isn't the best and I don't think it is that reliable regarding notifications. I am also not sure about switching everything over from Google Play to App Store. That might be a pain.I've also debated to keep an Android phone and invest in an iPad to replace my Samsung one which is starting to struggle. ","501":"Hello there,My iPhone XR, that was given to me by my ex needs an upgrade. I love trying new things and like the idea of switching to Pixel. Also, the phone comes with ear buds as part of the deal which I could use at the moment. However, I also use Mac, Apple Watch and AirTags so the ecosystem got me locked in, which I hate but it does indeed make life easier. I use phone just for fun, reading news, listening to music, phone calls, messaging, playing chess, social media, some internet banking and investing. All work I do on my Mac and Mirrorless camera.  Apple makes great, reliable products but I do find iPhones a bit boring after decades of using them plus the price which is justified I suppose. I\u2019m self-made with no family and had to safe every penny my whole life to progress but don\u2019t mind spending on things that last and work well. I work as a digital designer so all tech innovations are great to observe\/experience for me. All in all.. I\u2019m a bit excited about a change but hesitant, wondering if I\u2019m just making my life more complicated out of boredom.

I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Google Pixel 8 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro, but I'm having a hard time deciding which one to go for.My main priority is a good camera, especially for daylight and outdoor photography. I don't play games on my phone, so performance for gaming isn't a concern. My typical usage includes social media, photography, and general day-to-day tasks.I've also noticed that my carrier offers the Redmi 14 Ultra. Should I be considering that as well?  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with these phones, especially in terms of camera performance and overall usability. Thanks in advance for your help!","503":"PLEASE HELP ME DECIDE WHICH PHONE WILL SUIT ME BEST! I have been using Samsung phones since 2012, and there's a lot that I like about them. I like that I can use Samsung's apps (like messenger, Samsung pay, Samsung themes, etc) rather than Google's, and I don't hate their overlay. However, my current phone (Galaxy S21) is approaching the end of its useful life after 4 years of faithful service.Here's the problem I have:I do not like \"AI\" features, bloatware, or being forced to update to (in my opinion) worse versions of software. After some research, and 4 hours of bothering every mobile associate in my local Best Buy, I have narrowed the field down to either a Pixel 9, or a OnePlus 12R. Both have some strong pros, and some strong cons, and I'm not sure which is the better fit for me in the long run.Pros for the Pixel 9 (for me personally):- Can be financed through my carrier, so there is 0 up-front cost- \"Minimal\" bloatware- Potential to run Graphene OSCons for the Pixel 9:- Not all AI features can be turned off- Out of box experience is based totally around Google services which I'd prefer to avoid- Installing Graphene would be a whole new thing I need to learn and I'm not sure that I'd even like GraphenePros for the OnePlus 12R- Out of box OS does not include any AI- UI is similar enough to Samsung that I feel confident that I will like it- Comes in really nice colors- Currently on sale, and would allow me to keep a cheaper phone plan. Could potentially be cheaper in the long term. Cons for the OnePlus 12R- Upcoming OS update adds AI, and I'm not sure if it will allow me to keep running the old version.- If I am forced to update, I don't know if AI features can be turned off (and to what extent)- No option to switch to Graphene if I'm forced to update and it sucks- Not available through my carrier, so I would have to buy outright. Up-front cost would be around $600 (in my local market, including sales, in my local currency)Some more general things about me:- I do use my phone very heavily, both for work and personal use. I use a work profile on my S21, which is required by my company in order to access my work email on my phone.- I am trying to be more environmentally responsible with my tech, and I try keep my phones as long as possible. I want this phone to last 4+ years.- I will use the browser (Firefox)  rather than an app for as much as I possibly can.- I value privacy very highly, and I do not like even the possibility that some corporate entity could access my messages. I don't use RCS for texting, and Whatsapp is only tolerated because it's required by my work.- I don't do social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc)- I don't take a lot of pictures and I do not care about camera specs or features.[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/1hnk9zc)","504":"I moved out of Android with an iPhone sometime in August 2022 with the iPhone 13. While it's been a fun time with iOS, I find myself in a spot where it's gotten taxing. I really want sideloading and a file system I can work with and Apple isn't budging anytime. So, the only answer is to move out. For context, my family and peer circle is predominantly iOS centric but I am willing to risk it.I have a few choices with notes about what I think about them, but I don't know what to aim at.1. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra(**\u20b9**91,500): - I love this phone and it's what I had in mind when I wanted to move back. But it's sharp corners and big frame just doesn't do it for me. Also, the large camera bump isn't something I am willing to pay extra for. I have a dedicated mirrorless camera if I wanted to take pictures and videos so. 2. OnePlus 12(**\u20b9**58,990): - Lovely phone but I abhor ColorOS. OxygenOS is sizeably different but it still has shades of ColorOS in it. I had a bad experience with Realme and I don't want to relive that. The hardware is good but that screen's a worry. I don't know how prevalent green-line issues are in the 12 but it's still scary. 3. Samsung Z Flip 5(**\u20b9**92,990):- A flip phone is also something I seriously considered (especially with the Z Flip 6's launch) but the reliability quotient is something I am worried about. Plus the charging speed is a question and a half. 4. Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus(**\u20b9**94,990): - Second priority choice for me. I love it's goldilocks size. And the Plus model has a QHD panel which is something that I am interested in. But I don't agree with the prices. Maybe when the S25 series comes out and this gets discounted?5. Google Pixel 8 (**\u20b9**68,999): - Standard-cut option I have feelings for, especially after seeing how Google's the closest knit ecosystem we have after Samsung and Apple. But it's not available in-store which is a downer.My usecase is mostly university centric so that involves talking to people on text, class submissions, assignments, social media and whatnot. Gaming isn't priority number one for me so I don't mind sacrificing a few FPS here and there for an overall nice experience. Please help me decide. ","505":"Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018intelligence\u2019, \u2018best ever\u2019, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don\u2019t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on\/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us \u2014 this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should\u2019ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their \u201csecurity and privacy rule\u201d! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn\u2019t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn\u2019t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it \u201csaving the environment\u201d? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung\u2019s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new \u2018move to iOS\u2019 app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don\u2019t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don\u2019t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. ","506":"for my whole life ive bought sub 150 generic androids (unlocked) from ebay. this was  200 dollars, came out recently and its by far the worst phone ive ever owned. i even have another friend, same phone, hers has all of the same problems. we both bought it retail.samsung 10e? amazing, got it for free when at&t cut off 3g (i didnt even have a plan, it was prepaid) decent camera, fast, surprisingly durablemotorola g7? worked fine, got it for 100 bucks in 2020lg g7? worked fine, no issues until its battery started goingsamsung s8 active? worked greathuawei tracphone from forever ago, back when smartphones ram was listed in megabytes? responsive, fast for browsing, watching videos was finethis phone out of box(me and friend both experience this)? takes a solid 5 seconds to get to its own home screen, every click has a whole second delay before the phone registers an input, sometimes even longer,commonly seems to just forget you touched the screen at all. browsing is like beyond frustrating between the input delay, phone ignoring inputs, horrible wifi speed, like ill click something and have to wait 5-10 seconds to even tell if i should click again unless i want to watch a random ad because it auto clicks as soon as the 1st page loads.camera, which claims 50 megapixels?? worst ive ever had, this thing has to have some prohibitively small sensor, you will literally get noise in broad daylight i am not joking. the 50 mp setting for the back facing also makes it to where you cant zoom in and is NOTICEABLY lower quality than the 12 mp setting, i really dont understand how you make a camera so bad post 2016. beyond that it also takes like 10 or so seconds to open, even using open before unlocking feature. if you want to capture a moment quickly as its happening, an animal, a friend goofing off, any scene at all really, you are better off just drawing it from memory unless you want to be awkwardly telling your friend to hold that candid organic smile for a minute or 2. selfie cam and video setting also cannot lock exposure???? almost all of my previous phones have had that feature like i dont understand why you would take it off.the gps is by far the least accurate ive seen since phones started coming out with gps. i can stand still in an area with good connection and the phone will seemingly estimate within the nearest 200 yards. itll think you teleported 2 steets over,it will often think youre going the opposite of the direction youre going, if youre on the interstate going over another road it will teleport you onto that road, take 20 seconds to reroute, then take another 20 to find out why youre not on that road. ive been driving before and had it think i turned onto a \"road\" that isnt on the map and goes to the middle of a lake, im not kidding its commical. the amount of times it has thought i was swimming in the middle of the mississippi or that i was driving into a building. idk i guess a plus is that its made me learn how to navigate without using the map at all lmaoand we havent even addressed the issues that commonly cropped up over less than a year of use :)phone will now enter a random click mode where it believes im clicking 100 random spots at once, making the phone unusable. sometimes itll just think im clicking 1 spot 100 times, making just unlocking the phone impossible because it thinks im spamming the backspace button. this is the phone people make memes about like \"fbi agent opens your phone, tells your mom to go fuck herself, sends your crush your most embarrassing selfie, contacts isis, threatens to blow up friends house, deletes all your social media\". ive had to embarrassingly explain to my boss that i \"butt dialed\" their phone 3 times in a row :). typing is faster on a flip phone by a lot.its to the point where i believe all of the reviews that praise it are most certainly fake or paid for by the company, not even on some conspiracy shit, like the website reviews saying this is a \"great budget option!!\" are lying through their teeth. most of them praise things that have been standard for years, i saw a site say \"this phone can do everything! it can browse the world wide web, listen to spotify, take pictures of your family, and even watch movies on netflix!\" and i feel like thats one of the biggest tells. if this phone has any of the specs it claims to have then there must be some \"we hate poor people\" software that semi bricks the phone by default. the folks that say things like \"well its a budget phone, get a more expensive one, you get what you pay for\" have never owned the phone, or have absolutely no clue what the standard for budget phones is, and theres people out here recommending it to people looking for phones with a budget of 200, like yall gotta be some plants theres just no wayEdit because i forgot soooo many things: phone cant unlock itself like 25% of the time, its as if the hardware cant run the software and it just doesnt know what to do. It will display random error messages (unlocked it once and it refused saying \"disabled screenshot feature due to security reasons\" or something like that) and has fits if you restart it. Like it waits until you open the phone to do its start up processes, so if you restart your phone and leave it for like a whole week, as soon as you open it, \"phone is starting up\" and it acts as if its coming out of a literal coma. Edit because of suggestions from users: sorry guys, i tried all of the things below and as of august 16th, no setting changed anything, no amount of cache clearing, updating, running on different modes, etc. This just rekindles my reason for such a rageful and lengthy post, whoever made this phone needs to be punished in the fashion of the times this phone is reminiscent of and should thus be burned on a stake","507":"**SUPER LONG POST WARNING**Let me start off by saying that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is an incredible phone, and I have absolutely no problems recommending it, but over my week or so of testing and comparing both phones, I've made some notable observations\u2014a majority of which have swayed me to stay with my S24U, though some of which tempted me to switch over to the 16PM. You'll notice that some of these observations are specific to the phones themselves, while others are more about the general operating systems. KEEP IN MIND, I've had the S24U since launch (late January), so due to prolonged usage, comparing it to a brand new phone may not exactly seem fair, but I'm just working with what I've got.P.S. While this post may help those who are considering switching to\/from any of these devices, I won't be touching on EVERY SINGLE aspect of the phones, but rather just things I noticed and found most important in my comparison period; even if you think something obvious is missing here, it just means it wasn't super important to me in my considerations.\u00a0# BATTERY LIFEBattery life on the 16PM seems to be better than on the S24U in just about every way. Less drain in standby, social media apps, video playback, benchmarks, games, and especially while using the camera\u2014just way more SOT overall. The S24U has the benefit of faster 45W charging, which is good if your battery is close to dying and you need some juice in a short amount of time, but needless to say, this wouldn't really even be much of a problem if the phone had guaranteed all-day battery life. Not saying the S24U's battery life is bad by any means\u2014I range anywhere between 5.5-8.5 hours of SOT depending on usage\u2014but it seems like the 16PM can give me at least another hour, if not two, on top of that, and I'd simply trust it more to give me all-day battery life than the S24U.And before anyone goes on to comment that I may have degraded my S24U's battery health since I've had it for a few months, NO\u2014I used the ADB method to check battery health on Samsung phones (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1XRGZWUrxh4rEDVY\\_ECQ6L1PhA-24KUOjnUdg2ZcxqjE\/edit?usp=sharing) and it shows 100%.# CAMERASThe cameras on both phones are generally very good, though both excel in certain areas more than in others. Both phones take excellent main and ultrawide shots with nice detail. Colors on the S24U are more boosted and saturated, whereas the 16PM produces more natural-looking results that are closer to real life. Samsung's harsh image processing actually makes some shots look fantastic, but straight up ruins other certain shots. Selfies are great on both too with good detail. Night shots are also decent on both phones, but I've actually been leaning more towards the S24U's results, as it basically always lets in more light than the 16PM even at the same exposure, and so in SUPER dark environments, you're just able to get a much more usable result from the S24U; detail level is about the same.The 16PM produces slightly better video (more detail and the natural colors really help it here), better portrait shots (superior edge detection, especially when it comes to fine hairs), and better macro shots (I can get closer to the subject before losing focus when compared to the S24U), but where it pales in comparison and almost falls apart is with zoom shots. MY GOD, the 16PM's zoom shots are so poor compared to the S24U's that I'm left not only unimpressed, but straight up disappointed. Since the 16PM can zoom up to 25x in photos, I've been testing both phones at 5x, 10x, and 25x, and the S24U simply produces far better results EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Dare I say it, but the 16PM's zoom shots are borderline unusable for me. Also, I haven't really been able to test motion \/ pictures of moving objects, as I don't have any pets or kids, though literally everyone says iPhones are superior in this regard, so take that as you will.Lastly on the cameras, I haven't found myself using the 16PM's Camera Control like at all. It works fine as a way to just open the camera, but using it to go through menus\/options isn't always easy, and actually trying to use it as a shutter button is way harder than just tapping the screen because your hand will almost always move \/ shake when pressing it due to the way it's designed, resulting in blurry photos.# DISPLAYBoth phones have gorgeous displays. They both have excellent detail, with the S24U taking a MARGINAL edge, and get super bright. I've been using the S24U in vivid mode, and the colors simply look way nicer compared to the 16PM. The dynamic island is actually quite a useful feature in some ways (will talk more about this later), but the hole-punch cutout on the S24U itself provides a more uninterrupted video playback experience than the 16PM. To the iPhone's credit through, it seems that a lot of video \/ media content (especially in social media apps) goes all the way up to the very top of the screen, whereas on the S24U, it mostly cuts off at the hole-punch.Back to brightness for a sec though, because while the S24U technically has a higher (outdoor) peak brightness, I've found that it dims quite quickly. In my initial camera testing outside for example, which lasted about 45 minutes, the S24U dropped from full brightness in about 10 minutes of camera usage, whereas the 16PM retained its brightness throughout the 45-minute period, at which point it was WAY brighter than the S24U, making it more usable outdoors for prolonged usage. Yes, the S24U's anti-reflective coating is nice, but it can't really make up for how dim the display automatically gets. I'm gonna touch on performance later, but it's kinda the same story for games. After maybe 20 minutes of playing any even remotely intensive game, the S24U display dimmed from full brightness, whereas in that same period, the 16PM retained its full brightness. I did, however, recently find a way to make it so that the S24U display doesn't dim, and it's the Thermal Guardian tool within Good Lock, however I've found that this doesn't always work. Again, I'm gonna talk more about performance separately, but for instance, the S24U display still dimmed while running the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test, whereas that didn't initially happen on the 16PM, however the 16PM also eventually dimmed after maybe my 4th run on the same test, so there's that, but this only happened once.Aside from this weird brightness inconsistency on the S24U though, both displays are, once again, fantastic to look at.https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lnh763p1altd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=747dc3156317b3b499da2036e9069b8599f81a25# PERFORMANCEAs for performance, the 16PM wins in raw benchmarks. Higher single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores and better performance in 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Stress Test (both phones had a similar best loop score but the iPhone had much better stability) with less battery drain. All this makes sense since the A18 Pro is a newer chip than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and Apple's efficiency when it comes to their silicon is quite simply unparalleled. When it comes to real-world performance though\u2014loading things, going through menus in apps, etc.\u2014both phones are basically the same from what I can tell.\u00a0 They both feel super snappy with basically no lag.However, I have found a couple advantages with the 16PM. First of all\u2014and this is something that really impressed me\u2014loading web pages is NEAR-INSTANTANEOUS. Doesn't matter if it's in Chrome or Safari, the iPhone has almost 0 delay when trying to go to a website\u2014the image\/home page of the website literally just appears basically as soon as you hit search\/enter. It's not that the S24U is slow or anything, it's just that the 16PM is almost instant and there's basically no waiting at all. Another thing\u2014and this is relatively minor but still something I personally noticed\u2014I'm a student, and Canvas loads WAY faster on the 16PM than on the S24U. I'm talking like a 7-second delay between the time my courses show up on the iPhone vs on the S24U. On the other hand though, when I tried Amazon on both phones, for example, the S24U was faster. No matter which product or menu I click on, the S24U ALWAYS loads faster here. One annoying thing about the S24U\u2014really Android in general, is the fact that Google Maps navigation isn't smooth at all compared to iOS. On iOS, it runs buttery smooth, whereas on Android, the frequency is noticeably lower. I know Android does this probably just to save battery life, but the fact that the iPhone lasts longer (in my testing) anyway makes it that bit more annoying. I don't know, just a personal gripe I have.\u00a0I also did some RAM management testing on both phones. The 16PM has 8GB, whereas the S24U has 12GB (I have RAM plus disabled). Both phones did an excellent job of holding apps in memory after some time and not refreshing, although I found just one specific observation from this test. Call it nit-picking, but when I opened Twitter (I know it's X but I'm still calling it Twitter) and went to a specific tweet on each phone, and then came back to the Twitter app after some time, the S24U was still on that tweet, whereas the 16PM clicked off the tweet and went back to the timeline, but it was still showing that same tweet on the timeline, so I technically didn't lose what I was looking at. Repeated this multiple times and the same thing happened every time. I don't know, minor issue, but just thought I'd mention it.When it comes to gaming, both phones do well. As mentioned at the top, the 16PM consumes less battery when playing a certain game for the same amount of time, but when it comes to performance, both are great. I did notice though that in some games, the menus feel smoother and less choppy on the 16PM than on the S24U, however their frame rates in-game are basically identical, and I feel this is more important anyway. Also, on the 16PM, it seems like I have to do a double-swipe to exit most games\u2014no idea why this is a thing.I guess this is where I should also mention something basically everyone uses, social media, and yeah\u2014social media is still quite a bit better-optimized for iOS. The camera quality directly within apps such as Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc. is still a bit worse on Android. Then there's just some app-specific things that piss me off about Android in general. For example, on Instagram, when you're sharing a video to your story on iOS, you can choose which part of the video to share. Video sharing (to stories) in general also takes less time on iOS than on Android. Also, when you see a Reel pop up on your feed and go to expand it (to full screen) on Android, it'll just start over, whereas it'll continue playing from where you left off on iOS. For Twitter, you can't search your bookmarks on Android like you can on iOS, and\u00a0 you can disable auto-play video straight from the video, whereas you have to go into settings to do that on Android, and even then, it doesn't even work! Also with Twitter, a lot of the times all the quotes for a tweet don't even load\/show, and they never load in chronological order unlike on iOS. Even worse\u2014and this is a rare issue though I thought I'd still mention it\u2014sometimes all the replies don't even show for a specific tweet. For Reddit, the only real difference I've found is that the \"History\" section loads way faster on iOS than on Android\u2014I'm talking like a whole 10 seconds faster.Lastly on the performance front, I guess I'll also mention software updates\/support. The S24U promises 7 years of OS updates, which is fantastic. Apple hasn't disclosed the number for the 16PM I believe, but it doesn't really matter as we all know even old iPhones get multiple years of OS update support (I have a 12 Mini laying around that has iOS 18 on it). Basically, you don't need to worry about (lack of) software support for any of these phones.All in all, while the 16PM wins out in some areas due to better optimization, day-to-day performance on both phones is equally as good.# FEATURESBoth phones have some nice features. On the 16PM, the dynamic island is actually useful in some ways, like for deliveries through Uber Eats, timers, and music. Live actions is also a nice touch on iOS\u2014good for sports. As for Apple Intelligence, I'm using the beta, and I'll be brutally honest\u2014it's kinda useless (for now, anyway). I haven't found myself using it for anything that I'm not already able to do with Circle to Search on the S24U, as well as with Google Assistant or Gemini. Speaking of the S24U's features now, yeah, Circle to Search ... it's actually very useful. Allows me to, for example, translate text straight from the source, without having to open Google Lens or the translate app like on iOS. Galaxy AI is also decent, though I haven't really found myself using those tools much at all\u2014Call Assist and the interpreter are nice to have. When it comes to automation, it's Apple's Shortcuts vs Samsung's Routines, and honestly, I've been able to do more with the S24U here. For example, I have a routine that automatically enables auto-rotate every time I open Youtube or Google Maps, and then it goes back to its previous condition (locked orientation) when I exit them. I was actually able to get it to unlock the orientation on the 16PM, but I can't get it to revert back to its original state after I exit the apps (if someone knows how to do this \/ if it's possible, let me know). Lastly, the S Pen on the S24U is nice to have, but I honestly rarely use it\u2014only if I need to sign school or work documents on the go.# ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONSHere are just some additional things I took note of when comparing both phones, a majority of which favor the S24U:* The 16PM's haptics feel leagues above the competition, including the S24U, and the animations are so clean, making the 16PM feel like a more polished and premium piece of hardware.* The universal back gesture on Android is a massive, massive convenience (everyone already knows this). iOS, of course, only has its left-swipe gesture, and I've noticed that even that doesn't always take you back to the previous screen\/menu in certain apps. Like, sometimes, you have to swipe up or down, or hit the X in the corner, whereas on Android, swiping left or right ALWAYS works.* There's no clipboard system on iOS like there is on Android, and anytime I copy something on Android and go to paste it somewhere else, it'll show up along the top of the keyboard as soon as the keyboard pops up. Also, the iOS keyboard has no fixed number row, which is super annoying.* Notifications on iOS are a mess compared to Android because, unlike on Android, you can't always just see them on your lock screen or along the top left and go straight to them. Instead, you have them in the notification center, but the weird thing is, there'll be notifications that show up in the notification center that aren't even on the lock screen. So you may glance at your lock screen thinking you have no notifications, only to randomly access the notification center and find out that, yep, they're there. On Android, you'll ALWAYS know just by one look whether or not you have notifications to attend to. Also, the general grouping of notifications seems to be weird on iOS. Lastly, one part of Apple Intelligence creates AI-generated short forms of text to summarize your notifications\u2014I've found that this works fine for mail but not social media apps.* I'm someone who switches between manual and auto-brightness quite a lot, so having to go all the way into settings and navigate through different menus to disable auto-brightness on iOS is super annoying. On Android, I can do this straight from the notification shade, which is so much quicker and more convenient.* Maybe I'm wrong here so please do let me know, but I can't access settings straight from the control center on iOS, whereas I can easily get to settings from the notification shade on Android.* This has been one of my long-time gripes with iOS\u2014why can't I change the settings for certain apps STRAIGHT FROM THE APP? So often, I have to go to the actual settings app to make changes\u2014even for simple things like the camera and calendar. On Android, basically any app setting you want to change can just be changed straight from within the app.* The S24U can play 4320p (\"8K\") video via browser, whereas the 16PM only supports up to 2160p (\"4K\"). Quotations around these numbers because the displays aren't actually playing at those resolutions, but there's still (slightly) more detail playing content at 4320p vs 2160p, so while no one probably even cares about this, it's just nice to have.# COSTThe last thing I wanted to cover in this post is the cost of each phone because, that ultimately matters. Both phones are 512GB so that's the reference point I'll be using to compare prices (although the same cost differences should theoretically translate to the 256GB models). I got my S24U ultra through a variety of discounts (trade-in, pre-order promotions, student savings, etc.) and it's a bit complicated to explain so to be more fair, I'm going to compare their prices right now.On Samsung's website, you can currently pick up an unlocked 512GB S24 Ultra for $1170 AT MOST (so you could get it even lower with Samsung Offer Programs and\/or Samsung Shop offers), whereas an unlocked 16PM at the same storage will cost you $1400 (Apple isn't offering any promotions or discounts of any kind, though they basically never do). Samsung is always WAY more generous than Apple when it comes to trade-ins. What makes it even better for the Samsung slab is that, at the time of writing this post, Amazon is currently running their Prime Big Deal Days promo, and you can pick up an unlocked 512GB S24U for $1070. That's $100 less than the cost on Samsung's website if you don't take into consideration any additional discounts. I didn't even mention the fact that you can use cash back sites such as RetailMeNot and Rakuten to get some money back on your purchase if you go the Samsung route, whereas Apple doesn't allow you to use cash back services. So you're saving anywhere between $230-$330 AT LEAST if you get an S24U over a 16PM. So you have to ask yourself\u2014are you getting $230-$330 more worth of phone if you choose a 16PM instead? From my testing, no, absolutely not, and I feel like most people would probably agree with me here. The value\/savings are one of the main things I even decided to stick to my S24U.# CLOSUREOnce again, sorry for such a long post. I hope this helped someone out though who's cross-shopping these two devices or already has one of them and is looking to try the other out to see which one works for them. Hell, you may already have both devices yourself and are in the middle of comparing both, and maybe something in this post stood out to you and changed your mind. At the end of the day, it's personal preference, but for me, the S24U is a better fit and currently a better value, and so the 16PM will be returned. Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

I've been scratching my head over something lately, and I'm wondering if any of you have similar experiences or insights.So, I've used both Android and iOS extensively. I'm talking about everything from personal use to professional stuff. I've really put both through their paces.Here's the thing: I genuinely believe Android is more intuitive and flexible, especially for advanced users. iPhones, to me, feel more like appliances - they work, but only in the way Apple wants them to.But here's what's bugging me: iPhones are EVERYWHERE. I was at a mall food court the other day, and the sheer number of iPhones caught my eye. I started paying attention and realized I was seeing like 5 iPhones for every Android. Looked it up later, and apparently iPhones have over 53% market share in the US. What gives?I have a Pixel 8 Pro, and while I love it, I hit a snag that made me think about this iPhone dominance. Tried to connect it to my Windows 11 PC via USB, and man, what a headache. I was able to see the folders but not the files. I had to dig through forums to find a solution, and if it wasn't for some tech-savvy user posting about a similar issue with a Pixel 7 Pro, I'd have been totally lost. Here's what I ended up having to do:1. In Windows 11, go into Device Manager and find the Pixel2. Completely uninstall the driver3. Navigate to C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\DriverStore-UMDF4. Find and delete a file called WpdMtpDr.dll5. But wait, that file was protected by TrustedInstaller! So I had to:   * Change the file ownership to my account   * Give myself full permissions   * Then finally delete it6. Restart both my PC and the phone7. Reconnect and pray it worksAnd yeah, it finally worked, but come on! This is stuff your average user would never figure out.I'll admit it - this probably wouldn't happen with an iPhone. You plug it in, it works. Simple.It got me thinking: Is this why iPhones are so popular? Are companies like Microsoft bending over backwards to make things work smoothly with iPhones because of their market share?Don't get me wrong, I still prefer Android. The freedom to tinker and customize is worth it for me. But I'm starting to see why the average Joe might lean towards an iPhone.What do you all think? Am I missing something here? Are there Android users out there feeling the same way? Or iPhone users who want to set me straight?Edit: Not sure if this is the right sub for this. Mods, feel free to guide me if there's a better place for this discussion","509":"I'm currently using a **Redmi Note 10 Pro** for almost 4 years.

I also own a macbook air m1 (2020) and an ipad 9th gen (2021) which have offered a great value without having to be upgraded after every few years.Given that, I currently use an android, specifically the OnePlus Nord Ce 2 lite (2022), which has been a great performer for its sub 200\u20ac price. Naturally wanting to upgrade, I feel it'd be great to do so while also having an entry into the apple ecosystem. My current budget is around 600\u20ac and have gone through several options like a used 15 pro, used 16 (upwards of ~675\u20ac), new\/used 15 (650\/600\u20ac). I had been waiting for the SE4\/16e but the pricing vs. value just doesn't make sense to me.The key areas in which I'm looking an upgrade are: 1) good cameras (not having to use gcam),2) a decent battery for non-intensive daily use (5-6h of SoT),3) atleast a few OS upgrades (haven't had the best experiences with androids like oneplus, asus, motorola etc.),4) a compact size and decent in-hand feel which won't be a fingerprint magnet (~6.1\/6.2\")5) a smooth user experience (snapdragon 695 is definitely showing its age),6) usb-c (so the 14 pro doesn't really make sense).7) *Edit: good haptics (I've tried the pixel 9 and the haptics were great, don't know how it compares to apple though)I'm aware that features like an always-on display, higher charging speeds, 120hz, dedicated telephoto lens are going to be the trade-offs but are they a deal breaker for someone upgrading from a series of cheap\/budget android phones? Even though I feel the galaxy S24 (~640\u20ac for 256gb) is cheaper and overall superior in terms of how much functionality a phone (along with its os) can offer, but is it enough to offset the convenience that an ecosystem can bring?PS: I've never used\/owned an iphone before.","511":"I'm using a Galaxy A40 rn and I'm generally happy with it, but the charging stops working randomly, so I'm looking for a new phone.I need a super reliable, compact phone with good battery life and a decent camera. After analyzing the market, I've narrowed it down to four options. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my needs.1. Samsung Galaxy S25Pros:- Best small form factor, super lightweight- Familiar UI, so I'll feel at home from the get-go- Well-balanced device with no major flawsCons:- after using Galaxy for 4 years, it's getting boring, and I\u2019d like to try something new2. Google Pixel 9 ProPros:- very appealing clean OS - Packed with AI features I plan to use for work- stellar camera experience-  by far the cheapest option where I liveCons:- Uncomfortably heavy (like the iPhone 16 Pro)- Pixel\u2019s notorious for poor heat management- Larger than the other options- Mixed battery life reviews3. Apple iPhone 16 ProPros:+ Best resale value over time (at least where I live)+ well optimized battery life+ camera that just works.+ probably the best heat managenent from the pack+ Always admired Apple and wanted to try oneCons:- as a lifelong Android user, I'm worried iOS would disrupt my productivity, making buying a new phone pointless since it's meant to be a work tool - quite heavy (like the Pixel)- Not interested in diving into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, except for this phone (I\u2019m a Linux user btw)4. Xiaomi 15Pros:+ Best battery life by far+ decent camera+ Compact and lightweight, smaller than the iPhone and Pixel+ Brand aligns with my values outside the prestige onesCons:- the OS is known to be bloated as hell, which is the last thing I want for my productivity- Likely poor long-term durability compared to others- chinese phones depreciate so fast that reselling doesn't make sense, forcing me to keep it until it diesOverall priorities:1. Battery life - Essential as I'm often on the go2. Reliability - I store important data and can't risk losing it if the phone breaks3. Compactness and weight - I just dislike big phones4. Good heat management - My Galaxies overheat during navigation or video calls, and I won\u2019t buy another phone with this issueThings I don\u2019t care about:1. Fast\/wireless charging2. Speaker quality3. Fingerprint sensor (I don\u2019t use it)4. Years of updates (I won\u2019t keep the phone more than 4 years)I decided not to focus on camera and CPU specs, as all the listed phones perform well in these areas. The Pixel and Galaxy have an AI advantage, but it\u2019s subjective.The S25 seemed like the best choice since it has everything. Then I considered the Pixel, praised for addressing overheating and battery issues. But if I\u2019m buying a 200g phone, I might as well get the iPhone, which has the same virtues without Pixel\u2019s flaws. Then there's Xiaomi, with great battery life and size, but the bloatware is nearly a dealbreaker.Please don't suggest the Vivo X200 Pro Mini (I'm not buying it from China) or OnePlus 13 (it's too big). Both are great, but not options for me.Lastly, there are many reviews online, but they focus mainly on performance and battery out of the box. For me, the more important factor is how the phones perform after 2-3 years of use.","512":"So, for weeks now I'm trying to decide on a new phone and I'm still thinking of either going for an iphone 16 pro or an android alternative and since I can't really evaluate the \"value\" of the features between phones of the same price category, I thought about what may the disadvantages be?I know iOS has its own ecosystem, not being able to download outside of the store like with apks on android and whatnot. But does it really matter for the average phone user?  I, for example, use it for calls, texting on whatsapp, mails, photos and some other apps like youtube. So nothing really fancy or out of the norm. I think there the operating system shouldnt make any difference, right?And the other question which I still have after weeks is, how far apart are features like camera quality or battery lifetime between models?  As someone who isnt really in a photographic hobby or picture editing and just want to have nice pictures here and there or when on vacation, does one really notice the difference in the latest phones drastically?  Also, me coming from a soon 7 year old phone (huawei p20 pro), I do guess that everything is an upgrade for me eventually.Another unclear point for me is the battery. Does the size in mAh directly relate to the screen size in terms of power consumption or is there more behind it?  Looking at the new S25 models for example, the ultra has 5000mAh and the normal version 4000mAh. Do they end up at the same in terms of how long the battery lasts until having to recharge it.  Because since I currently have a 6,1\" phone, I want to stay a 6,3\" or smaller, so the all the different \"big\" models are mroe or less out of question and I wouldnt like it if just because of that the battery life for example is also worse.To name examples, I narrowed it down to the iphone 16 pro (not max), S25 (normal version), pixel pro 9. I even thought about the vivo 200pro, but I often read that apart from the camera, the rest feels rather cheap apparently and I'm at the smartphone size topic again with 6,8\" being too big for my taste","513":"Hey folks,My iPhone back plate and battery are damaged and I don't see any good reason to pay 200+ for having a 4 year old phone repaired. Like a lot of people in these days, I also want to switch to Android. Since I've never had something else than an iPhone though, I could use some help of some experienced android veterans.First things first: I plan to buy it straight without a contract and have a budget of like 700 - max 900 \u20ac.  I've researched some potential candidates within that price range:* Google Pixel 8 Pro* Samsung Galaxy S24+* Xiaomi T14 Pro  Since the Honor Magic6 Pro isn't available at a good price here in Germany and since its not waterproofed as the other models, this is something I could already remove from the selection.I know these phones are somewhat close to each other and they are all great compared to my current phone, but thats also why I can't quite decide what to pick up.In these days I became a \"normal user\" and I mainly want these things:* Good software user experience* Good camera quality* Long battery life* Attractive design* Good screen, especially for videos* Good connectivity to things like Android Auto and an Android Watch  I'm very grateful for every opinion and help on this!

I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","516":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","517":"Hey Guys,  Main Link: http:\/\/www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com  Original Thread: [Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/3u4pz2\/open_source_google_play_music_desktop_player\/)  3 months ago someone (\/u\/Feenex ) posted my Open Source player for Google Play Music to this subreddit and literally overnight it went from having 20 downloads to 5000. It has continued to grow insanely fast and now has just over 53,000 downloads.  For the past month now I have been working on porting the entire player to the Electron framework so that it can be cross-compiled for multiple platforms and today I am proud to announce the first release of the cross platform app.  As of right now you can head over to the [GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/MarshallOfSound\/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-) or the [website](http:\/\/www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com) and download either the Windows or Mac OSX variants.

Your support and appreciation has been overwhelming.  Thank you so much and I hope you keep enjoying the player","518":"So I have mostly had OnePlus android phones, and I have loved them. However, because they still rely on questionable networks, occasional texts still fail to get delivered. This only happens about 0.001% of the time or something like that. Still, I missed one particular text that was SUPER important that led to the end of a relationship. Things wouldn\u2019t have worked out anyway, but things would have ended much more pleasantly. So I decided that this situation was my wake-up call. I decided to get an iPhone because I imagine iMessage should significantly reduce this issue. After all, most of my friends have iPhones.I regret getting one so hard.I thought so many things would work better when I got iPhone, but I was so wrong! To handle my frustration, I have made a list of complaints. I wish I had known all of these things because I would have never switched if I did. Before I start, I also want to emphasize that this is my only apple product. If I had an iMac and an iPad, I wouldn\u2019t have so many complaints. However, I am a bioinformatician; I use Windows and Linux. So there is no chance I will be getting an iMac any time soon. Because I have been Android\/Windows-based, I am all in on google apps such as Chrome and Google Maps. Also, note that I am a bioinformatician and a recent college graduate, so I am very tech-savvy.I also want to mention that several things work well! There are several positives to having an iPhone, but these positives are completely overshadowed by the issues below.1. The apple move to iOS app is garbage. I tried for hours to get it to transfer my messages, and it never did. I had to use a paid app that cost $30. This moved my messages, but every time I send or receive a new text, it starts a new thread instead of following the imported android one. My iMessage inbox is such a mess. In addition, for some reason, several messages a day are coming to my email address instead of my phone! Now I feel like I am MORE likely to miss messages than before!2. I have disabled all iCloud syncing except for iMessage because they only give you 5GB free. I receive notifications every morning saying my iCloud is full. I have used 24 MB so far. This is a disgusting and deceitful way to bully customers into buying iCloud plus. This is what I am up to every day.3. Even though the Google versions are available, Apple forces you to use their apps. On Android, if I got an apple map location pin from a friend, I could still open it in Google Maps. But now that I have an iPhone, I have to open Apple maps when my friends send me locations from other iPhones, even though I have all my addresses and lists saved in Google maps. It is very tedious to transfer the location data from a pin in Apple Maps to Google maps. It is a similar story with Safari because the Chrome app is super basic on iPhone. I am not sure who to blame for this next issue; it might be Google. On iPhone, Google Chrome lacks the basic features of \u201cfind on page\u201d and \u201copen desktop version .\u201dOnline forums suggest both elements exist but rest assured that those features are not here on my phone.4. Siri is awful. Many Apple fans assume Siri is the best because that is all they ever used, but it is so much worse than Google! Google definitely has its issues, but with Siri, I have to constantly repeat myself because it doesn\u2019t catch what I am trying to say. But when it does catch what I am trying to say, it usually doesn\u2019t do what I would expect. Part of that is on me because I need to learn its preferred commands.5. Notifications are wacky. I use the Google calendar for work and personal life. But when I imported my accounts, Apple was very kind to copy all of my data over to their calendar app! Nice try. I am still going to use Google. So, I uninstall the Apple Calendar app. Somehow I still keep getting notifications from the Apple Calendar app, even though it should be removed from my phone!! I had to reinstall the zombie app, turn off notifications, and then uninstall the app again!6. Bluetooth is terrible. I don\u2019t have AirPods, but I have a nice pair of wireless earbuds from another company. They work perfectly with Android and Windows. But for some reason, they barely work with my iPhone. They do not auto-connect, and when I try to connect to them by clicking on the name of the headphones, the phone tells me to forget and reconnect the headphones. It doesn\u2019t do this every time, but it does this about once a day.7. I really miss my fingerprint scanner. With Covid, I wear a mask all day, every day. My face is never available, but my fingers are. My friends told me that Apple supposedly released an update to do FaceID work with a mask. Still, I have retrained my phone multiple times trying to get it to work, and it does not work!8. Something seems to be wrong with the GPS in my device. What is displayed on the screen is about 10 seconds behind where I am actually. It makes navigation feel like I have gone back in time ten years.9. Android Auto is far superior to Carplay! On Android, I can use Google Maps and have my music app display the current song being played at the bottom of the screen. There was no need to switch between apps. This is not the case for CarPlay. While navigating on Android Auto, I could also zoom in or out using my fingers to see the whole trip, but there is no such feature on Google maps. Also, when I use Siri to initiate calls while driving about half the time, it doesn\u2019t connect their audio to my car. So essentially, the call is placed, but I can\u2019t hear them, and they can\u2019t hear me. I choose not to make calls from my car anymore unless I unplug my phone, make the call, and reconnect mid-call.Some of you may have issues with my problems, and that\u2019s great! But that\u2019s not the point. Apple is marketed to be simple, and if I have to spend hours solving problems, the Apple image has failed me. If I hadn\u2019t bought this phone from an Apple Store, I would have assumed I received a fake Chinese knockoff from China with all my problems. Unfortunately, I am past the obnoxiously short 14 day return period, so I have to live with my mistake. If you are considering the switch from Android to Apple, please remember how much regret I feel in my soul for buying an iPhone. iPhones are riddled with more problems than I could have ever imagined. I wish I had been more grateful for how polished and logical Android was.Thanks for listening to my woes!","519":"I used Android exclusively since the T-Mobile G1. Since then, I always got the latest Android phones. That includes notable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Note 7. The Motorola Atrix. The Moto X. The Nexus 1, 4, 5, 6. Then finally the Pixel series starting with the 1, 2, 3, and now the 4.Last month I had an itching to try something new in quarantine, so I switched from my Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 Pro. There was initially a lot to like (build quality and screen mainly), but there were so many annoying quirks that I could not stand it for more than a month.If I could sum up my experience with the iPhone in one sentence, it would be \"Fantastic hardware, horrendous software\". iOS needs a ton of work in my opinion. Below is a recap of my issues with iOS:&#x200B;* Notifications are a mess   * Why are there two notification screens? \"Lockscreen\" and \"Notification center\". So many times I would think I've dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.   * It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.   * You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.   * If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn't dismiss it from your notifications. I've already read it, why is it still in my notifications?   * The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping \"by app\" in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc* Gestures   * You can only go \"back\" by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.   * There is no dedicated \"back\" button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to \"swipe away\" this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.* Home screen layout   * Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it's such a pain in the ass. Why can't I hide apps or have an app drawer?   * You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.* Apps   * Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is \"voluntary bloatware\". I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc   * Can't set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit \"navigate\", and it opened Apple Maps. There's no way to change this behavior.   * Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.   * There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.* Keyboards   * I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.   * If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no \"slide typing\" functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?   * If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having \"2 apps for every app\" like I mentioned in the Apps section above.* Camera\/Photos   * The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow   * Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I've only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it's seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn't understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a \"live view\" of what the portrait shot will look like.   * Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there's no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let's start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.* Background processes   * It's 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don't understand why.* iMessage\/FaceTime   * FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I'm a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn't really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime's moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to \"reply to\" a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.&#x200B;The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won't or can't fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.","520":"I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the \"I hate Samsung\" train that is r\/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying \"it's sooo smooth!\"  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious \"Pure Android\" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. A noteworthy experience, but can it last?My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g\u0336i\u0336m\u0336m\u0336i\u0336c\u0336k\u0336 feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. Picasso once said \"Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.\" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but \"THE\" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, \"Smooth now, but give it a month or two...\" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it\u2019s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I\u2019m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don\u2019t kill off the headphone jack. Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased\/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

We all praise the efforts from OEMs to keep our phones with the latest software. We love the updates for the new functionalities, increased stability or even for the sake of having a higher number buried on \"about the phone\" section. However it all goes to waste when companies, in this case, oneplus, break and\/or limit functionalities which were working good, with a new update iteration.    In this particular case, when the nougat update first started to roll out, people noted strange behaviors when using third party cameras (the ones that rely on camera2 API). Under some situations, the phones would hang for a long long time, crash, and display strange artifacts on the viewfinder. As it impacted heavily the phone camera usage, these issues were massively reported on oneplus forums, twitter and xda. (even by the creator of the known OpenCamera). Despite that, they got ignored, report after report, and still, to this day, almost a year later, there wasn't any official position on the issue      On the other hand, using the stock camera app won't reveal any issues. Why? Because it's using a modded legacy API (with HAL3 for the front camera according to sultanxda) to make it work. (The fact that an OEM is still using this method in 2017\/18 would deserve its own discussion, but I will leave as it is, since it's not particularly relevant for this topic). But, as you may ask, if the stock camera works seamlessly, why do we need to rely on 3rd party ones?    Several reasons tbh:    - Useless panorama mode  - **Lack of more advanced controls like intervalometer, exposure metering mode**  - **Lack of manual video settings**  - Low quality 1080p time lapse mode  - No sound with slow motion  - (you tell me) \/s    For those who might have interest on the topic, I'll shed this additional information.    - The camera will always crash during when pointed to bright scenes under some combinations of ISO and shutter speed.    - The exif data (ISO and shutter speed) is incorrectly reported on dark scenes    - Using full auto will allow higher than 799 ISO to be picked by the camera (despite the live stats of the app only read as 799). As soon as you force a manual control, the usable ISO range will be 100-799. Any higher than that and it is the same as 799.    These itself result on a partially useless camera2 API implementation which, if it wasn't enough already, make the phone unstable for every user. All it takes is a camera app download from the play store.      Detailed reports can be found [HERE (XDA)](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/oneplus-3t\/how-to\/camera2-bugs-t3569283) [HERE (ONEPLUS)](https:\/\/forums.oneplus.net\/threads\/camera2-api-bugs-for-3rd-party-camera-apps.506100\/) and [HERE (oneplus)](https:\/\/forums.oneplus.net\/threads\/camera-api-2-iso-settings-restricted.569762\/)      **Side note:** currently Google camera port is not 100% stable on our device for the same freaking reason, as it relies solely on camera API.    -      I don't like to free bash on companies, but this behavior is just unacceptable.   Can't just understand how can oneplus have a device unstable for a year without the intention to fix that. I'm really trying to bring attention to this as it is not a minor bug at all.    If this post leads to nowhere, at least I'm trying to inform people of the oneplus *modus operandi*. I still think their hardware is awesome (including my OP3T) but these decisions and the lacking support push me away from a future buy.  Never settle you say?      -        **TL;DR: Oneplus broke the camera2api since nougat update. Refuses to fix it, there are no official answers, despite it being reported countless times. All OP3(T) on nougat or oreo are not stable. Will face reboots and crashes under some usage patterns due to this problem**  **EDIT:**Thanks for the support guys!I've uploaded two videos showing the bug to make our message more clear.[Max\/Reported ISO bug](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWPgj82vIqM)[Phone Crashing and turning unresponsive](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NWA5Sws8rQA)I believe that we, android users, should have to option to choose. It's even more valid if we consider that our phone was marketed for, not only obviously, enthusiasts. That's why we fight to have the api working again. There are people who will find use in being able to shoot 500 30 secs 3200 ISO RAW photos 10 seconds to each other. Other will find the ability to shoot log video at a fixed 1\/48 exposure @24p to post produce later on computer. Other will just download GCAM mod and find that actually we can get some flagship level shots from this phone. That's all about what an open and enthusiast phone should be. I simply refuse to accept the situation which looks like a half made job. It's even worse when your new product suffers from similar issues. Oneplus has the funds and dimension to correct address this problem. There's no way a phone with a 440\u20ac price tag can be unstable when using any legit camera app, from the playstore itself, as long as it uses the HAL3.**EDIT2:** There's a petition up and running that Agent 8923 linked @ comments section[LINK](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/oneplus-oneplus-stop-ignoring-customers-and-fix-the-oneplus-3t-camera)**EDIT3:** Got a reddit PM from oneplus support. I know it does not mean much as lots of us reported the problem via submission forms and oneplus forums. I've told @oneplus via twitter about the problem 3 times only to be asked to use the bug submition form, which has resulted in nothing. I'm gathering all the info I can (logcats, dumps, crashing patterns, video proof, etc) to send them ASAP (and again lol). I will keep you updated later if it leads to somewhere ","523":"**tl;dr** According to the limited information we have now, *all apps* written for Android M can have access to e-mail addresses of the owner.---Now that we've seen the announcements from I\/O, we've probably all heard of the migration to *[runtime permissions](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM)*, which allow you to be asked for permissions while using the app, as opposed to during installation (a good thing). What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM&t=150) instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/preview\/features\/runtime-permissions.html), even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/frameworks\/base\/+\/android-m-preview\/core\/res\/AndroidManifest.xml) by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/2175688) for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=9621627) for mentioning this permission.)**My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)---*Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.* READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?* CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.* READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.* GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.* SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.* WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.* SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.* MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.* READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.* App names\/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as \"Android System\" or something equally serious.* Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. \"**Offline apps**\" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.If you have any thought on permissions that are inappropriate to grant automatically, please leave a comment. **Did I get something wrong? I'm sorry** - the available information is preliminary and still quite dispersed - again, please leave a comment.","524":"I was able to drop by [Google\u2019s Nexus Open Studio Event in New York City](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/3w34pc\/google_is_running_an_open_nexus_event_in_nyc\/) and it was a terrific, intimate event. There were neat little [Android Experiments](https:\/\/www.androidexperiments.com\/), [demos, sticker printers](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Nexusstudio), [and sample devices](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/nexusstudio\/). And even better, there were representatives from seemingly all of the disciplines at Google involved with the new Nexus phones: Android UX design, software product managers for Nexus, Nexus industrial design, Nexus hardware engineering, and others. And they were all super friendly and surprisingly open to answering all kinds of questions, from the mundane to controversial. In the end, whether or not we might agree or disagree with their product and design decisions, I came away with a clear picture of how passionate and thoughtful the folks at Google are.

Many people from the Nexus and Android teams were there and were incredibly friendly and open to engaging conversation. If you love learning about the small stories on Android\/Nexus development and Google, there is some really awesome stuff below like answers to the Nexus 6P display generation and more.**----------# ...On the development\/design timeline of the Nexus 5X\/6P:I learned that the design and development of a smartphone typically takes around two years. For the Nexus 5X and 6P?  ....a grueling **seven** months.# ...On the industrial design of the Nexus 5X:A lot of work went into the curvature and radius of the edges of the 5X and the camera \"hump\". The industrial designers ensured that each of the Nexus 5X's curves utilized \"C3\" continuous surfacing. It's a lot of work for a small detail, but offers significant rewards in terms of light play around the surface and how naturally\/organically the surface curves. (I admit this is all I was able to understand!)# ...On the engineering challenges to nail the industrial design of the Nexus 6P:I had personally naively assumed that since Nexus phones tended to be based off hardware designs of existing phones (the Nexus 4 and LG Optimus G, the Nexus 5 and the LG G2, etc.) that Google would be merely using established, solved industrial design processes that were well known by the manufacturing partner. It was interesting to find out that a lot of experimentation and testing still went into things like the bead blasting process and the diamond-cut chamfer.I had imagined that much like going to a paint store and picking from a huge wall of swatches, that the colors and finishes were a known and well-established thing for a manufacturing partner\u2014they just merely needed to be selected. However, even something like the media used in the bead blasting process still needed constant testing and refinement. The Nexus engineers and designers tried a variety of media like coconut shells, glass beads\u2014> *\"We spent lots of time over in China pulling samples fresh off the bead blasting manufacturing line, running over to a window, and scrutinizing the way the light played off the surface.\"*All told, there were around 80 different manufacturing steps for the Nexus 6P (and fun fact: Google dictated that all of the aluminum leftovers in manufacturing were to be collected and reused\/recycled). In fact, the circumferential chamfer that wraps around the visor is actually an industry first, using a brand-new process. In addition there were other major challenges in terms of managing the RF with an all metal phone\u2014making sure antennas weren't detuned by the aluminium body through careful injection molding processes. # ...On the relationship between the Nexus manufacturing partner and Google:I was surprised to learn that the manufacturing partner relationship can be a mixed bag and even depends on the partner (see next topic). Even with the latest Nexus 5X and 6P where Google exercised a considerable amount of design influence, there was a give and take between the manufacturing partner and Google. Oftentimes there was pushback from the partner for the sake engineering or manufacturing convenience\u2014one designer mentioned that it was three-months of back and forth *just* to get the USB Type-C connector centered on the bottom of the 6P. Another had referred to the bottom of the recently announced HTC A9 as evidence of design by cost and engineering convenience. He was sympathetic though, as he recognized that for many of Google's OEM partners, the teams live and die by the success (or lack thereof) of a single product launch, and so cost (in both design and manufacturing) is a legitimate consideration. Google, however, can afford to take a longer view on cost and invest in trying to hit a higher bar of design. The relationship was a lot of work (one Google engineer spent about two of the seven month development time over in China overseeing things), but it seems like both the [manufacturing partners](http:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/huawei-exec-nexus-6p-dream-also-challenging-one?utm_source=ac&utm_medium=dlvrit) and Nexus engineers and designers were really happy with the end result.# ...On the Nexus family design language and the Motorola Nexus 6:Following up on this, I asked about the Nexus 6 and the manufacturing partner selected for that generation, Motorola. Its design seemed to share more with other phones in the Motorola family than it did with any other device in the Nexus family. > *\"...Somebody backed out at the last minute.\"*I didn't poke any further, but it was added that as a manufacturing partner, Motorola exercised tighter control over the design and engineering of the phone, in a way vastly different from other Nexus partners. It sounded like Google designers and engineers (obviously) preferred the more Google-directed partnership, so this may be the last we see of a Nexus 6-ish device with a design that deviates so much from the Nexus family language. (And you all can read between the lines there.)# ...On the lessons learned from the Nexus 6:The team there recognized and acknowledged a lot of the complaints\/problems of the Nexus 6. It was too big, too bulky, hard to use one handed, and worst of all\u2014> *\"...the Nexus 6 spun around when you tried to use it on a table.\"*Along with the fact that the Nexus 5 was Google's best selling Nexus phone, this seemed to set the stage for what we see with the Nexus 5X and 6P today. First, a return to the tried-and-true formula of the Nexus 5, but with updated hardware and a modernized design for 2015. On the Nexus 6P, there were obviously more design changes. For one thing, the screen shrinkage from 6\" to 5.7\" seems small, but vastly improved one-handed use. Also, they were proud that they were able to fit a 5.7\" size screen into a device with the same phone size as competitors with a smaller 5.5\" screen (clearly a reference to the iPhone 6 Plus). In addition, the visor was a key design component addition. For one thing, an all-metal frame did need RF windows for sensors, cellular reception, etc. But moreover, the full-width visor allowed for a stable base... and no more spinning phones on tables. \ud83d\ude04# ...On the just-barely \"off center\" placement of the camera module in the Nexus 6P visor:I really enjoyed this particular story of the design and engineering hurdles with the Nexus 6P: Astute owners of the Nexus 6P might notice that the [camera lens is just-oh-so-slightly above the center axis of the oval camera \"surround\"](http:\/\/forums.androidcentral.com\/attachments\/nexus-6p\/202819d1445644158t-nexus-6p-build-quality-rear-glass-visor-gap-google-nexus-6p-review-camera.jpg) it sits within. Well, it turns out it wasn't just some design oversight.Thanks to the all-aluminum design of the Nexus 6P, all of the RF (wireless) \"stuff\" and sensors needs to fit within either the visor or the bottom plastic RF \"windows\". This includes the [NFC sensor](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), which was even of a special design that allowed for a small part of the sensor to sit \"above the fold\" in the RF window, while the rest was below (check out the teardown photo and you'll see). When it came to QC test the NFC sensor in the Nexus 6P's first iteration... **it failed**. Not enough of the sensor had been exposed in the visor, and they had to painfully widen the visor just a little. Well, the camera had originally been symmetrically aligned in the visor, but when they widened it, the camera was now off center (and unable to be moved around anymore because of design and timing limitations). To help conceal the now slightly-off center nature of the camera within the visor, the design team threw in the oval camera surround.# ...On bucking the trend of thinner phones with smaller batteries:When discussing the Nexus 6P \"visor hump\", I mentioned that one of the frequent suggestions I've seen in terms of eliminating humps altogether was to just maintain thickness on a phone and use the added volume for more battery capacity. The engineer just shrugged and replied:> *\"Apple really sets the bar on thinness there.\"*# ...On the Nexus 6P and 5X placement of the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:The Nexus design team considered and spent a lot of time researching three different fingerprint sensor locations before settling on the rear placement we know today: the bottom front (e.g., Samsung\/iPhone), the side power button (e.g., Sony Xperia), and the center rear. Designers liked the discoverability and accessibility of the Samsung\/iPhone model, but felt that the bottom edge placement placed all the weight of the phone aft of the sensor and there was a cantilevering effect that was both awkward and increased the risk of dropping. The side positioning had limitations based upon the thinness of the phone and those limitations would reduce the surface area available to read a fingerprint. The backside approach allowed for a large surface area to capture a fingerprint, was where the index finger naturally fell, and also was suitable for both right and left-handed users. > *\"As you scale the phone, the fingerprint sensor does not move\u2014because it's not based on [the size of] the phone, it's based on the human hand.\"*The backside sensor approach also had the benefit of being scalable and independent of phone size, which was particularly relevant for the two-sized Nexus launch. It was pointed out that the fingerprint sensor was in an almost identical location on both the Nexus 5X and 6P, despite the differences in the size of the phones. The hardware engineer conceded that the industrial designers were so passionate about perfecting the fingerprint sensor location that...> *\"In fact, [the industrial designers] were so adamant about basing this on the human hand [we had to compromise on the battery size](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), to make sure he got his way\u2014**to make sure it fit the human hand.**\"*# ...On how Google tested and benchmarked the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:Google wanted a quantitative way to measure the speed of the fingerprint sensor while they were optimizing its speed. So, Google engineers built a rig with a robot \"hand\" and highspeed camera for testing and benchmarking the fingerprint sensor. However, the missing link was what to use for the actual fleshy finger stand-in. > *\"The product manager for fingerprint... she was having lunch one day in the cafe and she was having chicken drumsticks. And she realized that the skin of the chicken drumstick is really similar to the human hand. So she took a batch of chicken drumsticks, took it upstairs to the lab, washed it, picked off a bit and tied it to the robot, and used that to measure the latency of the fingerprint sensor.\"*# ...On sourcing the new Sony camera module:The camera was clearly the major highlight of the event (other than the Nexus Imprint, both of which had key presentations), and many of the team I spoke with were incredibly proud of it. One product manager proudly noted that the sensor sourced was an industry-first and that it was pulled from Sony's digital camera parts bin (and not mobile camera menu).One of the things I learned from the team was that picking out a sensor is not merely just the picking of a sensor from a parts menu. In every implementation, Sony needs to attach a team to support the integration of the camera sensor. Sony was initially concerned that the sales volumes wouldn't be sufficient on the Nexus phones to be worth the investment for Google to reach so deep into their premium parts menu. It took a lot of convincing to get Sony onboard to provide Google this particular camera module. Thankfully it turns out Sony was really satisfied about the press and acclaim it received in connection with the new Nexus phones and their stellar camera.# ...On the absence of camera OIS:Sony did not offer this particular camera module with an OIS option.# ...On the Nexus 6P display, and whether it is a \u201ccurrent generation\u201d Samsung AMOLED display:> *\u201c...The Nexus 6P actually uses the same display panel as the Note 5\u201d*Knowing that this is a hot topic on \/r\/android, I brought up the fact that testing has shown that on the Nexus 6P, its display has a lower maximum brightness and higher display power consumption than seen on the Note 5\u2014key indicators of the AMOLED panel generation\u2014I received knowing acknowledgement. So it turns out that the display panel is the same, but that much like the practice of CPU\/SoC binning, there is variation inherent in AMOLED panel fabrication. Here, Google was able to procure the lower binned, yet current-generation displays from Samsung for the Nexus 6P. # ...On the thermals of the Snapdragon 810 SoC:The thermals of the Snapdragon 810 were known to Google and were of some concern. Qualcomm attached a team of engineers to help control thermals and supplied Google with a *third* version of the Snapdragon 810 (which when I got home, seems to match public, well-established reports that the Nexus 6P uses the v2.1 version of the 810).# ...On the removal of wireless charging from the Nexus 5X and 6P:It sounded like the intention to go with a never-been-done-before-on-Nexus all-aluminum design had a big role to play. The Qi wireless charging was not going to work on the metal back, and so it needed to be dropped. For the Nexus 5X, even though it had a plastic design, the product team consciously wanted to maintain a certain feature parity\/consistency between the two models (like in the same way they kept the same camera, flash, IR sensor, etc.) Furthermore, the reduced pain point of the universal direction USB Type C connector added onto the decision to drop wireless Qi charging.# ...On the Nexus 6P\"Bendgate\" controversy:All of the Nexus phones go through rigorous strength and wear testing. When the videos first broke out about the \"Nexus 6P Bendgate\", the engineers rushed back into the labs to double-check and rerun the tests to make sure they hadn't missed anything. The engineer I spoke with indicated that nearly all phones are strength tested to similar specifications and all have their first \"bend\" at a similar weight pressure\u2014he quoted the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6P to be around 40-45 kgs on the particular bending bench. Apparently, where phones vary is the ultimate failure strength (the amount of pressure for the phone to catastrophically fail after a first bend), but the pressure-to-first-bend was apparently consistent across most phones.# ...On the \"twist to launch\" camera action that was apparently pulled from the Nexus 6P:According to one product manager I spoke to about this, the feature didn't test well and was never formally implemented as opposed to being dropped\/pulled. It was an accident it was included on websites.# ...On controversial topics like internal storage and integrated batteries:I asked some of the product managers what they thought about the controversies over internal storage and integrated batteries\u2014particularly whether there was any truth to the theories that the limited internal storage was really an initiative to push users to cloud storage or that integrated batteries were there for planned obsolescence. The product managers were quite genuine and adamant that there were no ulterior motives and that things really boiled down to usability and design tradeoffs. On the internal storage side, they noted that this was an interesting and complex issue, and first pointed out that when they balance tradeoffs for a feature like expandable microSD storage, the same balance isn't made the same way for every market. For example, on Android One phones, the usability issues with microSD was outweighed by the need for price sensitivity and the greater challenges of single-up-front payment\u2014and this use case is reflected in the inclusion of microSD in Android One designs and in Marshmallow's stronger adoption of external storage. However, on the Nexus side, the usability issues with microSD won the day. The product managers were concerned about things like slower, poorer quality microSD cards and microSD failure that were challenging for users to self-diagnose when there were multiple kinds of storage. A single, high quality internal storage solved this issue (at the cost of expandability). They also noted that in addition to considering users, a single unified storage was easier and more predictable for developers\u2014a single fast and reliable internal storage meant better predictability on app performance, less problems with defining where to put files, and reduced troubleshooting\/customer service.We didn't get into the battery question as much, but the product managers noted that they really cared about the products they build. If they could have it their way, their phones would be timeless in a way similar to \"like a Gucci bag,\" with great longevity and resale value evidencing the quality of their product. So they too are disappointed with the inherent problems of lithium ion batteries. That said, the design benefits to an integrated battery were so great that the balance of tradeoffs really went in favor of non-removable batteries.Anyway, as a personal aside, I know these are really hot button topics on \/r\/android and for those folks that firmly sit on one side of the fence or the other, I'm not entirely sure any justification or rationale can be said that would be truly satisfying. I still hope this shed some additional light on the topic though!# ...On feedback on the Nexus products and Android UI:Everyone I spoke with was really open to hearing about feedback and even criticism. Many of them even browse \/r\/android and are well aware of the passionate \"feedback\" that users voice here. \ud83d\ude04 Some noted that they definitely have heard the requests for a smaller, more premium phone instead of the premium 6P phablet and economical 5X phone. They said they are always looking into the decisions around this and are always rethinking those decisions for the next generation.Another noted that in addition to the outside user feedback, they hear a lot of the same sentiment directly after the launch of a new feature or device. The engineers, designers, and other Googlers are a very vocal and strongly opinionated group and are frequently dogfooding and using their own products. I asked one of the UX designers what one of the most controversial things was that she had worked on\u2014she confessed that she worked on and helped to implement the [bolded hour digit in the Jelly Bean clock app](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/nexusae0_155.png). ...She noted with a smile that the reaction of Google staff on this change alone was swift and unequivocal.# ...On the functionality and evolution of Android volume control:A presentation was devoted to the user experience design and evolution of Android volume control from pre-Lollipop, to Lollipop, to Marshmallow and I also had an opportunity to chat with the UX designer on this. It would take too long to fully discuss each of the design decisions and cases they considered, but it was really neat to see the amount of user testing that went into this. I also gained a stronger appreciation of the challenges with something as superficially simple and innocent as \"volume control\"\u2014there are a serious amount of different permutations and use cases of alarms and volume control. These challenges were compounded by the fact that unlike many of Google's apps that are now decoupled from the OS and are updated routinely on the Play Store, volume control is still tightly woven into the OS. The UX team needs to finalize their decisions well before the launch of the OS and only has an annual window for which to make changes. # ...On the sale of Motorola to Lenovo:Google's OEM partners were really concerned that despite the firewalls between the two organizations, that there was too much threat that a Google-Motorola would turn into a fully vertical entity like Apple (or Microsoft today with its Surface tablets), squeezing out its partners in the Android ecosystem. When I asked why the OEM partners were okay with the Nexus program, it sounded like the Nexus sales were still quite relatively small compared to the bigger OEM players (Samsung, LG, etc.) and were not threatening. # ...On the Nexus 6P three-microphone noise cancellation:I thought I had seen on the [iFixit teardown](https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Nexus+6P+Teardown\/51660) that two of the advertised \u201c3 microphones (2 front, 1 rear) with noise cancellation\u201d were located within each of the front-facing speaker grills, but wasn't sure given the risks of interference from the speakers. It turns out the microphones are in fact in the speaker grills, and that they can be spaced in a way that minimizes interference from the speakers.# ...On the rumors of the next iPhone to pull the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of the Lightning connector:> *\"If anyone can do it, it's Apple and Beats.\"*The engineer noted that we've been stuck with the same form factor and technology on the 3.5mm analog jack for decades and figuring out the placement of it is a consistent design challenge and design limitation. There are a lot of new design opportunities afforded by moving to a new connector and opportunities around digital audio output (headphones with audiophile DACs and amps instead of relying on those in your phone!) and although Google doesn't really have the leverage to initiate a change like this, Apple definitely does\u2014especially through its ownership of Beats.# ...On knowing the name of the next Android version:The dessert naming decision of the next version of Android is not known to most Googlers, even those in the Android UX design team. So they are as surprised as everyone else when the statue is finally unveiled. However, while they don't often know the what the *right* choice will be for a name, they often know what it *won't be*, so internal and code references to wordy names like \"Lemon Meringue Pie\" were placed with tongues firmly in cheeks. The team at Google also had a lot of fun when David Burke trolled the community with his [infamous \"milkshake\" watch stunt](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/2015\/05\/28\/io-2015-dave-burke-wears-android-wear-watch-with-a-picture-of-a-milkshake-on-it-during-io-presentation-internet-freaks-out\/).","525":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations.

It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r\/samsung](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samsung\/) and [r\/galaxys10](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line \"powered by 360\". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo\\_360](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo_360)).If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998](https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \\[dot\\] cn, wshifen \\[dot\\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv](https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their \"Big Data   platform\", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the \"nothing to hide\" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.","527":"Hi \/r\/Android, if you don't know me, I'm Mishaal Rahman, the guy who wrote that absurdly long [Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/wek1m8\/android_13_changelog_a_deep_dive\/) that was posted to this subreddit recently. I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though.

[**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","528":"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green\/yellowish green. Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like \"Reset your device\". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https:\/\/forms.gle\/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1\/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a \"premium\" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a \"premium phone\", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- \"We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new\" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https:\/\/forms.gle\/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung.

But i can not wrap my head around it. Im one a Samsung Galaxy A51 and fail to see how this new IPhone is even close to being a \"value for your money\" phone. BUT before everyone is going ahead writing how this phone has the best mobile processor on the market - hear me out first ..All im doing is writing Whatsapp Messages ( yea im in Europe, Germany - there is absolutely no point in iMessage over here ), browsing reddit, watching Youtube Videos ( which is amazing on such a nice big AMOLED Screen ) and taking photos ( which is super nice with the variety of cameras on the back and totally enough for my personal use - i dont need super professional photos for pesonal use on my phone and its got 128 GB of storage for everything )  While all these tasks can be done for a very long time due to 4.000 mAh battery Now the big thing is that all these things run smoothly - absolutely no problems whatsoever. Do most people really do more with their phones? Im talking about more demanding tasks.From my point of view everybody fails to talk about real Budget phones ( Do they even exist in their world ) Its always about \"Big new flagship here - big new flagship there - flagship killer over there - OH THERE IS AN IPHONE FOR 479\u20ac THATS HUGE BANG FOR BUCK ) ... while im on my device thats 289\u20ac of the shelf and looking better for everything i do.Where am i going wrong? Do i fail to see why the processor is such a big deal on a phone thats doing nothing for professional use? Do Tech reviewers dont know about things like the Galaxy A-Series? Or any budget Series for that matter ( I dont care at all about brands ) Im absolutely not bashing on Apple or Android or anything else - i really want to understand what im not seeing. Maybe someone can help me out here.Or maybe im not the guy to know about brand-value .. maybe im just living in my own parallel Universe lolEdit: Guys. I didn't mean to be rude - my intention was simply to understand the other point of view. There is no need for another 80 comments to point out that software support is important and how my phone will not run for 5 years but the iPhone does ( even though my SO got a Galaxy A5 (2017) which runs perfectly fine ). I do understand that (very) important argument. But nonetheless - I do still think they could have made the SE more 2020 than 2016 - still give it a good price tag and still give it software support. That said, please be nice to each other, I just wanted to be educated ! :) Peace to the apple folks out thereEdit #2: I've read A LOT of your comments and came to a conclusion. As someone in the comments pointed out - yes I'm living in a parallel universe. It's called Europe and is apparently ( including the res of the world ) totally different from the US I'm terms of Smartphones lol - ultimately it's like metric vs. imperial system ^^","530":"Ok, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use\/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :)\u00a0First off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5\" is pretty common, with 6\" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5\". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5\" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity.\u00a0Second, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome.\u00a0Third, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with phones like Redmi 3S, Redmi Note 3, Lenovo Vibe K5 and its Note version, Samsung Galaxy J3, J5, J7, and not about OP3T and similarly priced phones. 20k+ (around $310) are not considered budget here, they are considered expensive. As for the Pixel, I have yet to see a Pixel XL here. So it's not popular at all. How much is that section popular in western countries? I have heard a few things about BLU smartphones.\u00a0Fourth, dual sims. In India, dual sim is a must have feature for most people, students and professionals alike. I myself have two phones, both dual sims. So I have actually four numbers. This is fairly common. If a phone is not dual sim, it won't sell much. Whereas from some comments on Reddit I have seen in passing, I think dual sim is not really a common trend in the US. People still carry two phones with one sim each, one for professional and other for personal use. Why is it so? What are the contributing factors?Edit : Since a lot of people are asking why I need four sims, let me clarify. I actually don't need 4,I'm keeping two extra just because I can and there is negligible maintenance cost involved. I (and most Indians) use prepaid. We 'reacharge' our numbers with, let's say, 100 rupees, and it gives me around 90 credits. Now I can use this credit to buy data, specific plans with limited validity, or I can just use it to call with the default call rates applying. Or I can just leave it be, and it'd remain there for months, sometimes years. Also, I chose 100 rupees as an example. I can also use 10 rupees' recharge. 1$ is around 60-65 Indian rupees. So with 1$, I'm set for months, or even years. \u00a0Now why I and several other people here use two sims. Without any extra expenditure. And since data packs and calling packs are seperate, the bill actually gets lower. For example, Telenor's call rates are dirt cheap, but its data speed is bad. On the other hand, Airtel has good data speeds, but its call rate is way more than Telenor's. So many people use Telenor for calling and Airtel for data, getting the best of both without shelling out double the money. Sorry for the wall of text :pTl;dr: lets discuss the differences in how Indians (easterners?) and Americans (westerners) use\/need features in their smartphones.","531":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","532":"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r\/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I\u2019m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience. [Here is a link to the old post, in case you\u2019re interested.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1w3woc\/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and\/) ##There are two ways of approaching this post:1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you\u2019ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills. **What is Java?** Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.  **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language** This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:     String name = \"Dennis\";     String surname = \"Cometti\";     String FullName = name + \" \" + surname;  After this runs, the variable FullName will equal \u201cDennis Cometti\u201d.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0). I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a \u2018Quote\u2019 Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person. **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English** All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:     String name = \"DENNIS\";     name = name.toLowerCase();  It couldn\u2019t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted \u201cDENNIS\u201d (\"dennis\") to the 'name' variable.After you have typed \u2018name.\u2019 Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance. **Classes, methods and objects in Java** \u2022     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain \u201cDennis\u201d and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89. \u2022     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView. \u2022     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car. \u2022     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects. **So what is the difference between classes and objects?** A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car). A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be a \u2018name\u2019 (containing the String \u201cDennis\u201d). If you are confused, don\u2019t worry, once you have followed the instructions you\u2019ll understand it much clearer. **Some Java related resources** - [The basics of Java](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)- [The syntax of Java](http:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/java\/java_basic_syntax.htm)  ##How do you get started making an app?  **Get Android Studio**Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don\u2019t let the words confuse you \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You\u2019ll come across many things you don\u2019t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn\u2019t need them for this exercise). #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don\u2019t open it yet.]( https:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html) **Strings in Android**Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.[Here\u2019s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http:\/\/developer.android.com\/guide\/topics\/resources\/string-resource.html) **How Android Studio works**Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won\u2019t be using many. When you create a new \u2018Project\u2019 (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.[This screenshot shows what it generates](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HOX9B7S.png)This looks quite complex but it\u2019s actually quite simple. For example the \u2018layout\u2019 folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you\u2019ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.     #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.> #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button. #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/o7NdR) #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http:\/\/imgur.com\/JM4BIMV.png) #Instruction #6:The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/pRisAsPFThis has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from \u201cTap the screen to begin\u201d to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color. #Instruction #7:Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3I7v9You\u2019ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.You will see \u2018public class Quote{}\u2019, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/VhHbWwSN Just click OK to any popup boxes.What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you \u2018instantiate\u2019 the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon. #Instruction #8:Click on the Quotebook class here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bG2d0VD.pngThen copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/wz8gbWWAYou\u2019ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable\/line: int count = 0;This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/3FXi14XZ     #Explanation time!     setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);     RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);  The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.____________________     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();      Quote quote1 = new Quote(\"You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck.\", \"Troy Barnes\");     quoteList.add(quote1);      Quote quote2 = new Quote(\"Cool Beans\", \"Rod Kimble\");     quoteList.add(quote2);  The first line here creates an Array\/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called \u2018quoteList\u2019. The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person\u2019s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.____________________This is where it gets a little tricky:     touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            @Override            public void onClick(View view) {                 if (count < quoteList.size()) {                    Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());                    count = count + 1;                 } else{                     count = 0;            }}});  This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.   #Instruction #9:Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018values-v21\u2019, they should both contain a file called styles.xmlIn the \u2018values\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar\" In the \u2018values-v21\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar\" This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes. #Instruction #10:To do this next step, you have to:- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed. - [Enable Developer Settings](http:\/\/www.greenbot.com\/article\/2457986\/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging. - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio\/ADB) Then, you have to click the [green play button](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app!

Recently I started to use this site more frequently, and I'd love to chime in and share some stories I *personally* found interesting. Not sure if anyone would be interested in me and the BTS of Magisk, but I'll share it anyways lol, it also helps me refresh my memory.### Who Am I?I'm a 22-year-old Electrical Engineering student from National Taiwan University. You can find me under the ID *topjohnwu* everywhere. Behind Magisk there is no corporation, no massive development team, no professional developers, it's just me, a passionate student that happens to know some coding :D. Starting as a noob, then writing scripts, all the way to developing Magisk, I consider myself far from a pro. I'm still learning how to properly write programs in general, learning the way to manage such large scale projects, and learning how Android works as AOSP is still pretty much a mysterious box to me. ### InspirationIt all started from [Chainfire's Marshmallow Systemless SuperSU](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showpost.php?p=63197935&postcount=2) (2015.10), at that time I was fascinated and immediately took the boot images and zips apart, becoming one of the first to [port it on a non-Nexus device (M8)](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/htc-one-m8\/general\/root-root-marshmallow-gpe-supersu-t3242210) (2015.11). Root became systemless, but I use Xposed and that modifies system, can I fix that? I tried migrating CF's Systemless scripts for Xposed but in vain: the bind mounts happens too late. I dug into my device's `init.rc` and [official docs](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/system\/core\/+\/master\/init\/README.md) to understand how `init` boots the system, and after tons of newbie effort I finally found out that `post-fs-data` is the earliest possible boot stage with `\/data` access and happens before `Zygote` starts (which pretty much means everything). As a noob it took me half a year to make this concept into reality and released [Systemless Xposed](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/xposed\/unofficial-systemless-xposed-t3388268) (2016.6). In my personal opinion it was a pretty significant breakthrough and maybe sparked excitement to many users.### The Birth of MagiskSince the release of Systemless Xposed, I started to get requests from developers to help porting their mods to work systemless-ly. I turned down many devs because the mods requires adding files into the filesystem, which is impossible with only using bind mounts because mounting won't work with a non-existing \"target\". A workaround did come across my mind (still the very core concept of Magisk), and I shared this idea with [Captain_Throwback](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/member.php?u=1162986), the first Magisk user and avid supporter since day one. He encouraged me to actually put this into practice, so I spent my summer vacation in front of my computer hacking up a [complicated script](https:\/\/github.com\/topjohnwu\/Magisk\/blob\/v7\/zip_static\/common\/magic_mask.sh) to create a so-called \"Systemless Interface\". Along with a combination of CF's `supolicy`, phh's `sepolicy-inject` and `bootimgtools` for handling SELinux and boot image extraction, Magisk is finally released to the public (2016.8).### The SafetyNet BattleAt that time, people were complaining that rooting breaks Android Pay. I briefly looked into the issue and found out that it was actually pretty easy to trick SafetyNet at that time. I introduced an extremely primitive method to bypass the checks and bundled it with Magisk. Since then the everlasting battle between Magisk and SafetyNet has started, and the detection rules and policies gradually became more and more stricter. Additional techniques are required, more hacks are added, and some major redesigns to the whole project has been done along the way. I won't go into the details here or this post will be 3 times longer :p### Pokemon GO CrazeI have to thank this game for Magisk's publicity LOL. PoGO added SN checks in one of its updates, and *swarms* of rooted PoGO players flooded the XDA thread to bypass SafetyNet checks. This was the point when my personal project thrived with a drastically increased user base, and I started to take things seriously. Without this initial boost, I'm not sure how long it'll take for people to recognize my project :)### The Beef: ControversyI asked Chainfire in the very early stages of Magisk for some help with SELinux but rejected because he wouldn't share his \"intellectual properties\". With no knowledge in SELinux, I decided to cut a corner in the first few releases and used SuperSU's `supolicy` to patch sepolicy. Due to modifications required in superuser for SafetyNet bypasses and the fact that SuperSU is closed source, there is no way to modify SuperSU and it was incompatible with my SN workarounds. To make things worse and more complicated, CF went on a vacation and I couldn't contact him for adjustments, so this made me turn to the open source [phh's su](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/android\/software-hacking\/wip-selinux-capable-superuser-t3216394) and modified it to work with Magisk. Obviously once CF was back from vacation, he was very upset about me using his work to promote the open source competitor. This of course was 100% my negligent and shows my immatureness. ([Chainfire's response](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showpost.php?p=68453946&postcount=1169) (2016.9))However, I was actually also pretty pissed by the situation. Chainfire took my `post-fs-data` discovery and added it into SuperSU without any credit, and created an obvious competitor to Magisk's SN bypass feature, [suhide](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/apps\/supersu\/suhide-t3450396), which relies on running stuffs in the `post-fs-data` stage. For a well experienced developer like him, my discovery might seem like nothing, but as a newcomer it actually took me months of research to figure it out. Later he also distributed my Systemless Xposed zip without my permission to promote his Xposed SN bypass capability of suhide. Ironically enough my effort ended up taken by the \"big guy\" for exploitation to attack me. In one of his posts he also publicly [express contempt for \"that sort of mod\"](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showpost.php?p=71561057&postcount=9345), obviously targeting Magisk, as \"a few lines of script\". Overall, I was wrong in the first place, CF didn't really hold me liable for the violation, and also I didn't really want to stir drama, so this was never publicly addressed until now.I'm not sure if there were any misunderstanding between us. I would say this was a pretty unfortunate situation from the beginning, and my immatureness is a huge part to be blamed.### Integrating SuperuserVery soon I spent a full month learning SELinux, getting ideas and help from phh, developing and enhancing the open source sepolicy patching tool and finally released the fully open source Magisk v7 with all previous releases removed for copyright reasons. Without knowing the secret within `supolicy`, I used a different approach to overcome SELinux. Due to the complications of SafetyNet hiding, treating superuser as an extension was not really that viable, so upon entering 2017, I used the whole month of the Chinese New Year Holiday to fully integrate phh's superuser and done many improvements to modernize the implementation. Magisk officially became a complete rooting solution, attracting users for the open source nature and SafetyNet hiding efforts.### Final WordsIf you managed to stay at this point, thank you for your attention :) The rest of the pieces of Magisk's history could be found in my announcement thread, as I tend to be very chatty in all my release notes (and of course including this post :p) 2017 was really an incredible year, I learned **a lot** in development, Magisk was massively and rapidly improved, and also it gained quite an impressive user base which I could never imagine. Pretty funny is that I bet very few people remember the fact that initially Magisk was only for the systemless interface and never meant to stumble upon the whole SafetyNet business, which eventually led it to become a rooting solution.I can't be more grateful to Android's open source community as I learned how to do Linux programming from the code of phhusson's superuser and the complete suite of the tools. I am also fortunate to have a group of passionate developers and testers across the globe willing to help me with development and sometimes guide me towards the correct direction. This is why I always keep my work open source, because I believe people should share knowledge to inspire others, just like how I am personally inspired from others to create Magisk.Looking forward to the future of Magisk in 2018!","534":"Please don't tell me I have a 'faulty unit' Every year I review my new phone here, and a barrage of evangelists jump in to tell me mine must be faulty. I have not bought 10 faulty devices in a row - I just like to give critical, honest reviews for people who care about details. And man, this one's a doozy.I moved from a Pixel 6 to an Exynos S22 last week because I wanted a smaller 'flagship' phone. It seems the battery life and performance are the worst I've experienced since the OG Motorola Droid. Chris from Tech Tablets is not exagerating when he says it is [such a laggy mess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/tntlmi\/dont_buy_the_samsung_galaxy_s22_ultra_its_a_mess\/) that it shouldn't be bought. It sounds like clickbait, but I just wanted to corroborate that he is correct - despite all of the good features, the battery and performance overshadow them all.For reference, I have my screen on a very low brightness (but still at 120hz as I can't go back to 60).  I set the processor to 'optimised' mode, but it hasn't made any difference. I don't allow most apps to run in the background, and I don't play games or do anything intensive, and I use WiFi all day rather than data. Basically, what I'm describing below is 'best case scenario', which is worrying.&#x200B;**Battery Life**According to 'device health', I'm using around 150% of the battery each day on average. Mostly, I'm having to charge by mid-afternoon.Today I was busy, so barely used the handset at all. I wanted to see how far it'd go on a single charge. It was in the 'red' after [11h39 minutes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gkHaxk0.jpg), of which 2h12 minutes was 'screen on' time, and maybe 10 minutes of listening to music (that's already cached offline).I don't game or do anything intensive: the main battery usage was by Google Play services, followed by the launcher, and then the always-on-display. Basically, all the things that just run in the background that usually don't rank in battery usage on other devices. The device optimization tool is reporting that no apps are using unusual battery.This means if I take my phone off charge to walk the dog at 7, it'll be dead before I get home for work even if I barely use it. I'm not a heavy user, and even for me this is deal-breaking. It is simply unable to make it through a working day, even if you limit your screen-on-time. I haven't had a handset like that for a very, very long time.In comparison, my Pixel 5 and Pixel 6 would make it through the day and through to the next morning with 4+ hours screen-on-time. The difference is astounding.&#x200B;**Performance**Awful. The screen is 120hz, but it's immediately obvious that it's dropping frames during animations and just generally struggling to keep up. It feels unpleasant to use.It is most noticeable with the 'home' gesture, which gives the haptic feedback about half a second after completing the gesture. I'm not sure if this is actually lag or just part of how Samsung gestures work, but it feels awful, like the interface is constantly behind the user. Home\/multitasking animations frequently stutter, the transition from AOD to home screen lags, and pulling down the notification tray often runs at below 30fps. It's very jarring with the screen going from jerky to smooth constantly.However, after 5 minutes of mild use (browsing Reddit, emails, or web) and the device will become *very* warm in the upper-left corner and it throttles *hard*. The phone becomes incredibly laggy and jittery. Like, you'll do a gesture and nothing happens, so you assume it hasn't registered. So you go to do the gesture again a second later and suddenly the first gesture happens under your thumb and you end up clicking the wrong thing. It feels like a website in the early 2000's where you end up accidentally clicking on popups.Again, I haven't really seen 'lag' in an Android phone since the Motorla Milestone. You wouldn't believe this is intended to compete with the Pixel 6 and iPhone - they feel generations apart. In fact, compared it to our 3 year old, \u00a3150 Xiaomi A2 in a blind test, you'd assume the A2 was the more recent device.I had a OnePlus One way back when, which was widely know for throttling. Well that ain't got shit on the S22. This is next level jank.&#x200B;**Summary**I cannot understand how this made it out of QA? I'm 100% convinced that last year's A series will beat this in framerate \/ responsiveness tests whilst using less battery. How have Samsung released a flagship that performs worse than their entry-leve devices?","535":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r\/samsung](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samsung\/) and [r\/galaxys10](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line \"powered by 360\". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo\\_360](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo_360)).If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998](https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \\[dot\\] cn, wshifen \\[dot\\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv](https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their \"Big Data   platform\", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the \"nothing to hide\" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.","537":"Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just \"guidelines\" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. \/rant (Edit: Thanks for the gold strangers! Also love the flair the mods gave this post haha)","538":"Hi \/r\/Android, if you don't know me, I'm Mishaal Rahman, the guy who wrote that absurdly long [Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/wek1m8\/android_13_changelog_a_deep_dive\/) that was posted to this subreddit recently. I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","539":"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green\/yellowish green. Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like \"Reset your device\". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https:\/\/forms.gle\/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1\/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a \"premium\" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a \"premium phone\", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- \"We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new\" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https:\/\/forms.gle\/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)One of the post is https:\/\/r2.community.samsung.com\/t5\/Galaxy-Note\/Samsung-Note-9-Display-Discoloration-amp-Overheating-Join\/td-p\/4049910 which was also posted on Reddit at https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/hmew1r\/samsung_note_9_display_discoloration_overheating\/You can see from the post that Samsung admins tried to delete the post 3 times before allowing it to be published.","540":"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted. Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package\\_name>.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device \/ OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/galaxy-note-10\/how-to\/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))2. **Privacy:**    1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.samruston.permission&hl=en_IN)    2. More privacy options can be found in settings \/ app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.tempmail&hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video \/ Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https:\/\/blokada.org\/index.html) **\/** [**DNS66**](https:\/\/f-droid.org\/en\/packages\/org.jak_linux.dns66\/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md](https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md))   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https:\/\/dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)4. **Performance and battery:**   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines \/ Tasker can be used to enhance battery life \/ performance, like      1. Turn off Mobile Data \/ Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.   6. Prefer Dark \/ Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.5. **Other tips:**   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https:\/\/vanced.app\/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings->App->Default Apps.   6. Using [**Your phone**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_IN) for more.    8. [**Hermit**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.   9. [**Firefox Send**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&hl=en_IN) can be used to send files < 2GB to anyone through a link.   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.Edit 1 : Added Google camera and snapdrop.","541":"Ok, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use\/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :)\u00a0First off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5\" is pretty common, with 6\" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5\". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5\" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity.\u00a0Second, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome.\u00a0Third, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with phones like Redmi 3S, Redmi Note 3, Lenovo Vibe K5 and its Note version, Samsung Galaxy J3, J5, J7, and not about OP3T and similarly priced phones. 20k+ (around $310) are not considered budget here, they are considered expensive. As for the Pixel, I have yet to see a Pixel XL here. So it's not popular at all. How much is that section popular in western countries? I have heard a few things about BLU smartphones.\u00a0Fourth, dual sims. In India, dual sim is a must have feature for most people, students and professionals alike. I myself have two phones, both dual sims. So I have actually four numbers. This is fairly common. If a phone is not dual sim, it won't sell much. Whereas from some comments on Reddit I have seen in passing, I think dual sim is not really a common trend in the US. People still carry two phones with one sim each, one for professional and other for personal use. Why is it so? What are the contributing factors?Edit : Since a lot of people are asking why I need four sims, let me clarify. I actually don't need 4,I'm keeping two extra just because I can and there is negligible maintenance cost involved. I (and most Indians) use prepaid. We 'reacharge' our numbers with, let's say, 100 rupees, and it gives me around 90 credits. Now I can use this credit to buy data, specific plans with limited validity, or I can just use it to call with the default call rates applying. Or I can just leave it be, and it'd remain there for months, sometimes years. Also, I chose 100 rupees as an example. I can also use 10 rupees' recharge. 1$ is around 60-65 Indian rupees. So with 1$, I'm set for months, or even years. \u00a0Now why I and several other people here use two sims. Without any extra expenditure. And since data packs and calling packs are seperate, the bill actually gets lower. For example, Telenor's call rates are dirt cheap, but its data speed is bad. On the other hand, Airtel has good data speeds, but its call rate is way more than Telenor's. So many people use Telenor for calling and Airtel for data, getting the best of both without shelling out double the money. Sorry for the wall of text :pTl;dr: lets discuss the differences in how Indians (easterners?) and Americans (westerners) use\/need features in their smartphones.","542":"Here's the message from Cliff, the Nova Launcher CM, [on their Discord](https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/466300922767736844\/466329173707980800\/1271132032931467305):  >It is with a very broken and heavy heart that I have to make this announcement.

I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","544":"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r\/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I\u2019m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience. [Here is a link to the old post, in case you\u2019re interested.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1w3woc\/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and\/) ##There are two ways of approaching this post:1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you\u2019ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills. **What is Java?** Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.  **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language** This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:     String name = \"Dennis\";     String surname = \"Cometti\";     String FullName = name + \" \" + surname;  After this runs, the variable FullName will equal \u201cDennis Cometti\u201d.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0). I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a \u2018Quote\u2019 Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person. **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English** All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:     String name = \"DENNIS\";     name = name.toLowerCase();  It couldn\u2019t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted \u201cDENNIS\u201d (\"dennis\") to the 'name' variable.After you have typed \u2018name.\u2019 Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance. **Classes, methods and objects in Java** \u2022     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain \u201cDennis\u201d and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89. \u2022     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView. \u2022     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car. \u2022     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects. **So what is the difference between classes and objects?** A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car). A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be a \u2018name\u2019 (containing the String \u201cDennis\u201d). If you are confused, don\u2019t worry, once you have followed the instructions you\u2019ll understand it much clearer. **Some Java related resources** - [The basics of Java](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)- [The syntax of Java](http:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/java\/java_basic_syntax.htm)  ##How do you get started making an app?  **Get Android Studio**Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don\u2019t let the words confuse you \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You\u2019ll come across many things you don\u2019t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn\u2019t need them for this exercise). #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don\u2019t open it yet.]( https:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html) **Strings in Android**Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.[Here\u2019s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http:\/\/developer.android.com\/guide\/topics\/resources\/string-resource.html) **How Android Studio works**Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won\u2019t be using many. When you create a new \u2018Project\u2019 (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.[This screenshot shows what it generates](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HOX9B7S.png)This looks quite complex but it\u2019s actually quite simple. For example the \u2018layout\u2019 folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you\u2019ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.     #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.> #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button. #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/o7NdR) #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http:\/\/imgur.com\/JM4BIMV.png) #Instruction #6:The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/pRisAsPFThis has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from \u201cTap the screen to begin\u201d to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color. #Instruction #7:Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3I7v9You\u2019ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.You will see \u2018public class Quote{}\u2019, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/VhHbWwSN Just click OK to any popup boxes.What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you \u2018instantiate\u2019 the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon. #Instruction #8:Click on the Quotebook class here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bG2d0VD.pngThen copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/wz8gbWWAYou\u2019ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable\/line: int count = 0;This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/3FXi14XZ     #Explanation time!     setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);     RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);  The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.____________________     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();      Quote quote1 = new Quote(\"You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck.\", \"Troy Barnes\");     quoteList.add(quote1);      Quote quote2 = new Quote(\"Cool Beans\", \"Rod Kimble\");     quoteList.add(quote2);  The first line here creates an Array\/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called \u2018quoteList\u2019. The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person\u2019s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.____________________This is where it gets a little tricky:     touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            @Override            public void onClick(View view) {                 if (count < quoteList.size()) {                    Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());                    count = count + 1;                 } else{                     count = 0;            }}});  This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.   #Instruction #9:Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018values-v21\u2019, they should both contain a file called styles.xmlIn the \u2018values\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar\" In the \u2018values-v21\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar\" This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes. #Instruction #10:To do this next step, you have to:- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed. - [Enable Developer Settings](http:\/\/www.greenbot.com\/article\/2457986\/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging. - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio\/ADB) Then, you have to click the [green play button](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app! If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers\/android studio. #Instruction #11:Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines. Change the font, colours, formatting or use.Share your own versions in the comments! #If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development. **Libraries** Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on.

Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just \"guidelines\" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. \/rant (Edit: Thanks for the gold strangers! Also love the flair the mods gave this post haha)","547":"Hi \/r\/Android, if you don't know me, I'm Mishaal Rahman, the guy who wrote that absurdly long [Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/wek1m8\/android_13_changelog_a_deep_dive\/) that was posted to this subreddit recently. I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","548":"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted. Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package\\_name>.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device \/ OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/galaxy-note-10\/how-to\/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))2. **Privacy:**    1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.samruston.permission&hl=en_IN)    2. More privacy options can be found in settings \/ app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.tempmail&hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video \/ Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https:\/\/blokada.org\/index.html) **\/** [**DNS66**](https:\/\/f-droid.org\/en\/packages\/org.jak_linux.dns66\/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md](https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md))   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https:\/\/dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)4. **Performance and battery:**   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines \/ Tasker can be used to enhance battery life \/ performance, like      1. Turn off Mobile Data \/ Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.   6. Prefer Dark \/ Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.5. **Other tips:**   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https:\/\/vanced.app\/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings->App->Default Apps.   6. Using [**Your phone**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_IN) for more.    8. [**Hermit**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.   9. [**Firefox Send**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&hl=en_IN) can be used to send files < 2GB to anyone through a link.   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing.

Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.Edit 1 : Added Google camera and snapdrop.","549":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","550":"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r\/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I\u2019m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience. [Here is a link to the old post, in case you\u2019re interested.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1w3woc\/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and\/) ##There are two ways of approaching this post:1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you\u2019ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills. **What is Java?** Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.  **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language** This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:     String name = \"Dennis\";     String surname = \"Cometti\";     String FullName = name + \" \" + surname;  After this runs, the variable FullName will equal \u201cDennis Cometti\u201d.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0). I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a \u2018Quote\u2019 Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person. **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English** All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:     String name = \"DENNIS\";     name = name.toLowerCase();  It couldn\u2019t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted \u201cDENNIS\u201d (\"dennis\") to the 'name' variable.After you have typed \u2018name.\u2019 Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance. **Classes, methods and objects in Java** \u2022     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain \u201cDennis\u201d and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89. \u2022     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView. \u2022     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car. \u2022     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects. **So what is the difference between classes and objects?** A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car). A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be a \u2018name\u2019 (containing the String \u201cDennis\u201d). If you are confused, don\u2019t worry, once you have followed the instructions you\u2019ll understand it much clearer. **Some Java related resources** - [The basics of Java](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)- [The syntax of Java](http:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/java\/java_basic_syntax.htm)  ##How do you get started making an app?  **Get Android Studio**Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don\u2019t let the words confuse you \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You\u2019ll come across many things you don\u2019t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn\u2019t need them for this exercise). #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don\u2019t open it yet.]( https:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html) **Strings in Android**Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.[Here\u2019s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http:\/\/developer.android.com\/guide\/topics\/resources\/string-resource.html) **How Android Studio works**Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won\u2019t be using many. When you create a new \u2018Project\u2019 (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.[This screenshot shows what it generates](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HOX9B7S.png)This looks quite complex but it\u2019s actually quite simple. For example the \u2018layout\u2019 folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you\u2019ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.     #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.> #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button. #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/o7NdR) #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http:\/\/imgur.com\/JM4BIMV.png) #Instruction #6:The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/pRisAsPFThis has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from \u201cTap the screen to begin\u201d to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color. #Instruction #7:Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3I7v9You\u2019ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.You will see \u2018public class Quote{}\u2019, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/VhHbWwSN Just click OK to any popup boxes.What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you \u2018instantiate\u2019 the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon. #Instruction #8:Click on the Quotebook class here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bG2d0VD.pngThen copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/wz8gbWWAYou\u2019ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable\/line: int count = 0;This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/3FXi14XZ     #Explanation time!     setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);     RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);  The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.____________________     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();      Quote quote1 = new Quote(\"You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck.\", \"Troy Barnes\");     quoteList.add(quote1);      Quote quote2 = new Quote(\"Cool Beans\", \"Rod Kimble\");     quoteList.add(quote2);  The first line here creates an Array\/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called \u2018quoteList\u2019. The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person\u2019s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.____________________This is where it gets a little tricky:     touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            @Override            public void onClick(View view) {                 if (count < quoteList.size()) {                    Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());                    count = count + 1;                 } else{                     count = 0;            }}});  This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.   #Instruction #9:Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018values-v21\u2019, they should both contain a file called styles.xmlIn the \u2018values\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar\" In the \u2018values-v21\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar\" This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes. #Instruction #10:To do this next step, you have to:- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed. - [Enable Developer Settings](http:\/\/www.greenbot.com\/article\/2457986\/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging. - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio\/ADB) Then, you have to click the [green play button](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app! If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers\/android studio. #Instruction #11:Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines. Change the font, colours, formatting or use.Share your own versions in the comments! #If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development. **Libraries** Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.

It seems however, cat has decided to stop playing.There is a [new Google Play Store policy](https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/11899428#accessibility_preview) coming up. Apps are no longer permitted to use Accessibility API for call recording on Google Play Store.Google have been working to stop call recording on Android for some time. They have blocked access to real call recording on Android 6 and completely blocked call recording over the microphone on Android 10. In response, apps started using Accessibility Service to record calls on Android 10 and above.Google have recently announced that from 11th May 2022 they will not allow apps on Google Play Store to use Accessibility Service for call recording.The new policy clearly states that \"The Accessibility API is not designed and cannot be requested for remote call audio recording.\" They have also addressed this in their [webinar video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d21mg8JxxU0&t=2990s).If you watch the video however, you will hear that the presenter mistakenly claiming phone apps having access to call audio. This is not correct, only phone app that come with your phone or made by Google can access the call audio. 3rd party apps cannot.I think total ban approach in the name of user privacy is not good for the consumer. Call recording is a valid need for many businesses and people. Banning it from Google Play Store will push people to look elsewhere and start installing apps from unknown or not trusted sources.They once had a go in the initial days of Android 11 and  implemented a privacy respecting call recording functionality that beeps when call is recorded. Unfortunately, whatever happened it was not included in the final version of Android 11.&#x200B;|Android version|ACR Phone from Google Play|ACR Phone from other stores||:-|:-|:-||**Normal calls**||||7-8|Two way real call recording including Bluetooth\/Headphones|Two way real call recording including Bluetooth\/Headphones||9|Call recording from microphone or loud speaker|Call recording from microphone or loud speaker||10+|**Silent audio recording**|Call recording from microphone or loud speaker||**SIP calls**||||7+|Two way real call recording including Bluetooth\/Headphones|Two way real call recording including Bluetooth\/Headphones|&#x200B;","552":"Please don't tell me I have a 'faulty unit' Every year I review my new phone here, and a barrage of evangelists jump in to tell me mine must be faulty. I have not bought 10 faulty devices in a row - I just like to give critical, honest reviews for people who care about details. And man, this one's a doozy.I moved from a Pixel 6 to an Exynos S22 last week because I wanted a smaller 'flagship' phone. It seems the battery life and performance are the worst I've experienced since the OG Motorola Droid. Chris from Tech Tablets is not exagerating when he says it is [such a laggy mess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/tntlmi\/dont_buy_the_samsung_galaxy_s22_ultra_its_a_mess\/) that it shouldn't be bought. It sounds like clickbait, but I just wanted to corroborate that he is correct - despite all of the good features, the battery and performance overshadow them all.For reference, I have my screen on a very low brightness (but still at 120hz as I can't go back to 60).  I set the processor to 'optimised' mode, but it hasn't made any difference. I don't allow most apps to run in the background, and I don't play games or do anything intensive, and I use WiFi all day rather than data. Basically, what I'm describing below is 'best case scenario', which is worrying.&#x200B;**Battery Life**According to 'device health', I'm using around 150% of the battery each day on average. Mostly, I'm having to charge by mid-afternoon.Today I was busy, so barely used the handset at all. I wanted to see how far it'd go on a single charge. It was in the 'red' after [11h39 minutes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gkHaxk0.jpg), of which 2h12 minutes was 'screen on' time, and maybe 10 minutes of listening to music (that's already cached offline).I don't game or do anything intensive: the main battery usage was by Google Play services, followed by the launcher, and then the always-on-display. Basically, all the things that just run in the background that usually don't rank in battery usage on other devices. The device optimization tool is reporting that no apps are using unusual battery.This means if I take my phone off charge to walk the dog at 7, it'll be dead before I get home for work even if I barely use it. I'm not a heavy user, and even for me this is deal-breaking. It is simply unable to make it through a working day, even if you limit your screen-on-time. I haven't had a handset like that for a very, very long time.In comparison, my Pixel 5 and Pixel 6 would make it through the day and through to the next morning with 4+ hours screen-on-time. The difference is astounding.&#x200B;**Performance**Awful. The screen is 120hz, but it's immediately obvious that it's dropping frames during animations and just generally struggling to keep up. It feels unpleasant to use.It is most noticeable with the 'home' gesture, which gives the haptic feedback about half a second after completing the gesture. I'm not sure if this is actually lag or just part of how Samsung gestures work, but it feels awful, like the interface is constantly behind the user. Home\/multitasking animations frequently stutter, the transition from AOD to home screen lags, and pulling down the notification tray often runs at below 30fps. It's very jarring with the screen going from jerky to smooth constantly.However, after 5 minutes of mild use (browsing Reddit, emails, or web) and the device will become *very* warm in the upper-left corner and it throttles *hard*. The phone becomes incredibly laggy and jittery. Like, you'll do a gesture and nothing happens, so you assume it hasn't registered. So you go to do the gesture again a second later and suddenly the first gesture happens under your thumb and you end up clicking the wrong thing. It feels like a website in the early 2000's where you end up accidentally clicking on popups.Again, I haven't really seen 'lag' in an Android phone since the Motorla Milestone. You wouldn't believe this is intended to compete with the Pixel 6 and iPhone - they feel generations apart. In fact, compared it to our 3 year old, \u00a3150 Xiaomi A2 in a blind test, you'd assume the A2 was the more recent device.I had a OnePlus One way back when, which was widely know for throttling. Well that ain't got shit on the S22. This is next level jank.&#x200B;**Summary**I cannot understand how this made it out of QA? I'm 100% convinced that last year's A series will beat this in framerate \/ responsiveness tests whilst using less battery. How have Samsung released a flagship that performs worse than their entry-leve devices?","553":"This recently released [research paper: Data Security on Mobile Devices: Current State of the Art, Open Problems, and Proposed Solutions](https:\/\/securephones.io\/main.html) by [Matthew Green and his team](https:\/\/threadreaderapp.com\/thread\/1341746171220537344.html) which is also covered by [WIRED](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/smartphone-encryption-law-enforcement-tools\/) talks about design flaw in data encryption of android and iOS. Wired brushes off most of the technical details and the paper didn't cover [android's File Based Encryption](https:\/\/source.android.com\/security\/encryption\/file-based) very well which I think needs some clarity on it. The paper draws the correct conclusion though and what should be improved in successor android versions.----------In android 7+, `\/data` partition is encrypted by **File Based Encryption** (FBE) on first boot by default. FBE keys are generated in **hardware-backed keystore**. FBE keys are encrypted in keystore with the key derived from user's screen lock password. So unless you enter correct password, keystore cannot decrypt FBE keys. When you reboot your device, it is in **Before First Unlock** (BFU) state which means the user has yet to unlock screen first time since reboot. In this state, if someone calls you or messages you, their name won't show up unless you unlock your screen. That's because the device is waiting for your lock screen password which is to be used to decrypt FBE keys and FBE keys are encrypting your contact names.Once you unlock your screen first time since reboot, it goes to **After First Unlock** (AFU) state which means the user has unlocked the device first time since reboot. Further locking and unlocking won't revert the state unless you reboot again which throws you back on BFU.----------**Temporary per-boot key**: In AFU state, FBE keys are decrypted by the keystore and are immediately re-encrypted again by a temporary per-boot key. Per-boot key is generated & stored by keystore and its validity is until next reboot. Encrypted FBE keys blob is then **cached** in `\/system\/vold`. This ensures that FBE keys are never in plain text when cached by the OS.----------As FBE keys are cached though encrypted, you can now use your biometric to unlock screen and kernel can request keystore to decrypt FBE keys on demand means whenever an application wants to read and write, kernel will load FBE keys in memory and they will remain in memory until next reboot. That's because running apps need them for read and write even if you lock your screen. E.g. To display contacts on lock screen, sharing live location, listening to music, sync services, etc. they need those keys in memory else they won't work on locked screen.This opens a security hole. Users don't often reboot their devices for months so it is in AFU state. The intruder and law enforcement can extract those keys from memory to decrypt sensitive data of running applications without knowing your screen lock. **This procedure requires carefully exposing the SoC without disconnecting the battery.**----------iOS encrypts personal data with keys that are evicted from memory 10 seconds after locking the screen. When it is in BFU state, iPhone needs password to derive a **Class key**. At this time, biometric won't work. When it is in AFU state, it caches **Class key** in Secure Enclave. Now user can use biometric and cached Class key is used to re-derive those evicted keys again when screen is locked and unlocked.----------This keys eviction feature is what android also needs otherwise if the intruder is able to decrypt whole `\/data` partition, he can own that data in it or if he wants to own the stolen device and doesn't care about the data, he could be able to set `enable` bit for OEM unlocking. Thent he can go to bootloader mode and unlock the bootloader.> In most cases, FBE keys also undergo an additional key derivation step in the kernel in order to generate the subkeys actually used to do the encryption, for example per-file or per-mode keys.If FBE keys are compromised, so will sub-keys so this derivation step doesn't add much protection even if sub-keys are evicted in newer versions. Android should keep FBE key bundle in keystore itself and load sub-keys in memory some of which can be evicted after screen lock.Law enforcement can just force your fingerprint to unlock your device and can lie about that in court that it was already unlocked at the time of arrest so no kind of device security can stop them. Locks deter only honest people.----------Most common questions:1. Why biometric doesn't work after reboot?- After reboot, the device is in BFU state and waiting for you to enter PIN\/password which can be used to derive key that decrypts FBE keys.2. How does biometric decrypt FBE keys again when the user locks and unlocks the screen second time (or Nth time)?- It doesn't. FBE keys were already decrypted by the keystore when the screen was unlocked first time since reboot (They are re-encrypted by a different key and cached, see temporary per-boot key section). When you unlock using biometric, keystore lets the OS know that the user is verified and should be allowed access. This is enforced by SELinux policy.3. I forgot my PIN\/password, why do I need to factory reset the device to use my phone? That would erase all my data.- Your PIN\/password is used to derive key that encrypts and decrypts FBE keys as explained in the post. If you have forgotten your PIN\/password, your data cannot be decrypted anyway so even if there was a feature to reset PIN without factory reset, it would be useless. Instead it would allow thieves to reset PIN and reuse your device.4. If data partition is not decrypted until you enter your password, where does the phone store things like language, wallpaper, wifi logins, Bluetooth pairings that are visible right after the phone boots?- I intentionally left out this part that FBE has 2 types of storage:  Device Encrypted Storage: This is directly encrypted by keystore and do not require your password for decryption.  Credentials Encrypted Storage: This is encrypted with a key derived from your password.  The most basic functionalities are encrypted under device encrypted storage so that your phone will be still usable for taking calls and receiving messages even if you don't unlock it.5. **While in lockdown mode, my contact names are still showing up on call**- I checked in settings and it says that it **turns off smart lock, fingerprint and notifications on lock screen**. So it doesn't clear keys in memory probably because Google wants to ensure usability of background apps like listening to music. This means it may disable biometric for law enforcement but won't put your phone back in BFU state.  Android apps process cycle isn't designed to adapt if FBE keys are suddenly cleared from memory without letting the apps know. It would instantly crash most of the system apps and services because of I\/O error when they couldn't find keys. In iOS, apps are alerted that the user has locked the device.6. Why can't biometric be used as a key to decrypt FBE keys?- Because you always put your finger slightly differently on the sensor. Keystore approves authentication if enough of the mathematical values match. To use something as a key or to derive a key from something, you need something that doesn't change and always produces the same output.7. What about multi-user phones? I have a dummy profile set up and if I never unlocked my main profile after reboot I can't see it's files from it.  But if I have unlocked previously I see them.- If multi-user profiles are set up, keys can be recovered for currently running user only. When you switch user, keys for earlier user are cleared from memory. That's another good way to stay safe without rebooting the device.8. Wait, why is only `\/data` partiton encrypted, but system partitons are not?- You don't need encryption for system partitions. Other partitions are already public images. What you need is their integrity protection. All system partitions are protected by [android verified boot 2.0](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/external\/avb\/+\/master\/README.md)----------**Post is archived**?

However, because they still rely on questionable networks, occasional texts still fail to get delivered. This only happens about 0.001% of the time or something like that. Still, I missed one particular text that was SUPER important that led to the end of a relationship. Things wouldn\u2019t have worked out anyway, but things would have ended much more pleasantly. So I decided that this situation was my wake-up call. I decided to get an iPhone because I imagine iMessage should significantly reduce this issue. After all, most of my friends have iPhones.I regret getting one so hard.I thought so many things would work better when I got iPhone, but I was so wrong! To handle my frustration, I have made a list of complaints. I wish I had known all of these things because I would have never switched if I did. Before I start, I also want to emphasize that this is my only apple product. If I had an iMac and an iPad, I wouldn\u2019t have so many complaints. However, I am a bioinformatician; I use Windows and Linux. So there is no chance I will be getting an iMac any time soon. Because I have been Android\/Windows-based, I am all in on google apps such as Chrome and Google Maps. Also, note that I am a bioinformatician and a recent college graduate, so I am very tech-savvy.I also want to mention that several things work well! There are several positives to having an iPhone, but these positives are completely overshadowed by the issues below.1. The apple move to iOS app is garbage. I tried for hours to get it to transfer my messages, and it never did. I had to use a paid app that cost $30. This moved my messages, but every time I send or receive a new text, it starts a new thread instead of following the imported android one. My iMessage inbox is such a mess. In addition, for some reason, several messages a day are coming to my email address instead of my phone! Now I feel like I am MORE likely to miss messages than before!2. I have disabled all iCloud syncing except for iMessage because they only give you 5GB free. I receive notifications every morning saying my iCloud is full. I have used 24 MB so far. This is a disgusting and deceitful way to bully customers into buying iCloud plus. This is what I am up to every day.3. Even though the Google versions are available, Apple forces you to use their apps. On Android, if I got an apple map location pin from a friend, I could still open it in Google Maps. But now that I have an iPhone, I have to open Apple maps when my friends send me locations from other iPhones, even though I have all my addresses and lists saved in Google maps. It is very tedious to transfer the location data from a pin in Apple Maps to Google maps. It is a similar story with Safari because the Chrome app is super basic on iPhone. I am not sure who to blame for this next issue; it might be Google. On iPhone, Google Chrome lacks the basic features of \u201cfind on page\u201d and \u201copen desktop version .\u201dOnline forums suggest both elements exist but rest assured that those features are not here on my phone.4. Siri is awful. Many Apple fans assume Siri is the best because that is all they ever used, but it is so much worse than Google! Google definitely has its issues, but with Siri, I have to constantly repeat myself because it doesn\u2019t catch what I am trying to say. But when it does catch what I am trying to say, it usually doesn\u2019t do what I would expect. Part of that is on me because I need to learn its preferred commands.5. Notifications are wacky. I use the Google calendar for work and personal life. But when I imported my accounts, Apple was very kind to copy all of my data over to their calendar app! Nice try. I am still going to use Google. So, I uninstall the Apple Calendar app. Somehow I still keep getting notifications from the Apple Calendar app, even though it should be removed from my phone!! I had to reinstall the zombie app, turn off notifications, and then uninstall the app again!6. Bluetooth is terrible. I don\u2019t have AirPods, but I have a nice pair of wireless earbuds from another company. They work perfectly with Android and Windows. But for some reason, they barely work with my iPhone. They do not auto-connect, and when I try to connect to them by clicking on the name of the headphones, the phone tells me to forget and reconnect the headphones. It doesn\u2019t do this every time, but it does this about once a day.7. I really miss my fingerprint scanner. With Covid, I wear a mask all day, every day. My face is never available, but my fingers are. My friends told me that Apple supposedly released an update to do FaceID work with a mask. Still, I have retrained my phone multiple times trying to get it to work, and it does not work!8. Something seems to be wrong with the GPS in my device. What is displayed on the screen is about 10 seconds behind where I am actually. It makes navigation feel like I have gone back in time ten years.9. Android Auto is far superior to Carplay! On Android, I can use Google Maps and have my music app display the current song being played at the bottom of the screen. There was no need to switch between apps. This is not the case for CarPlay. While navigating on Android Auto, I could also zoom in or out using my fingers to see the whole trip, but there is no such feature on Google maps. Also, when I use Siri to initiate calls while driving about half the time, it doesn\u2019t connect their audio to my car. So essentially, the call is placed, but I can\u2019t hear them, and they can\u2019t hear me. I choose not to make calls from my car anymore unless I unplug my phone, make the call, and reconnect mid-call.Some of you may have issues with my problems, and that\u2019s great! But that\u2019s not the point. Apple is marketed to be simple, and if I have to spend hours solving problems, the Apple image has failed me. If I hadn\u2019t bought this phone from an Apple Store, I would have assumed I received a fake Chinese knockoff from China with all my problems. Unfortunately, I am past the obnoxiously short 14 day return period, so I have to live with my mistake. If you are considering the switch from Android to Apple, please remember how much regret I feel in my soul for buying an iPhone. iPhones are riddled with more problems than I could have ever imagined. I wish I had been more grateful for how polished and logical Android was.Thanks for listening to my woes!","555":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen.

I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","557":"I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the \"I hate Samsung\" train that is r\/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying \"it's sooo smooth!\"  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious \"Pure Android\" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. A noteworthy experience, but can it last?My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g\u0336i\u0336m\u0336m\u0336i\u0336c\u0336k\u0336 feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. Picasso once said \"Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.\" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but \"THE\" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, \"Smooth now, but give it a month or two...\" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it\u2019s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I\u2019m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don\u2019t kill off the headphone jack. Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased\/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

[I\u2019ve got the following: Nexus 5, Moto X, OnePlus One, LG G3, Xperia Z2, One M8, and an iPhone 5S](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wSYMdM9.jpg). I\u2019ve sold quite a few others. I figured I\u2019d share my thoughts with all of you just in case it helps anyone make a decision.. I\u2019ll just break my thoughts out into some categories and just wax on for a bit.    _________________________>**Build and Hand Feel:****[Sony Xperia Z2](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pEb3bCZ.jpg)**The Z2 flat out feels premium. One might think the edges would be sharp and uncomfortable, but they\u2019re rounded just enough to be comfortable. The glass back actually sits pretty securely in the hand, and the buttons are in the perfect place. **[OnePlus One](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rnuF9Si.jpg)**I\u2019m still blown away with this back material on the 64GB version. It\u2019s completely unique and a fantastic choice for the back. The phone itself feels incredibly solid and again, buttons are easy to push and in a great spot. **[LG G3](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gj3qSGn.jpg)**The curved back and light weight make the phone easy to handle. The back buttons are neat, but not something I\u2019d ever consider necessary. It is indeed quite plasticky, though solid and not creaky. **[HTC One M8](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/1vIaN0d.jpg)**This thing feels phenomenal. It\u2019s a bit slippery and perhaps a bit fragile, but damn it feels ridiculously solid. I have unfortunately managed to chip the aluminum in two corners from a slide (read: Not a fall) onto the tile. The power button is a complete travesty however, as it\u2019s in the worst possible spot for a right-handed user. **[Moto X](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cCQPTIH.jpg)**Perhaps the greatest in hand feel of any handset I\u2019ve ever used. It\u2019s very well put together and a great example of plastic not feeling horrible. The completely empty front is wonderfully minimalistic, the buttons are in perfect position and solid, and the whole things is just comfortable. The back dimple is an awesome addition for such a minor design feature.**iPhone 5S** Typical aluminum and glass, feels like a tank. The fingerprint sensor is a great example of smart implementation of a feature as it\u2019s easy to operate in your normal pattern of usage. **Nexus 5**http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/R2V17vf.jpgNothing but a phone. Nice soft touch back material, good size and in-hand feel. The thing is about as barren as a device can be when it comes to design. I personally dig it, though I can see how one might find it bland.    _________________________>**Display****Sony Xperia Z2**Sony *definitely* listened to complaints about the Z1. The display is terrific. Colors are bright and accurate and blacks are great. The screen looks and feels *very* close to the glass as well. Brightness being a bit low would be my only complaint.**OnePlus One**The OPO has a good but not great 1920 x 1080 display. It\u2019s quite large at 5.5 inches. Brightness is adequate. The infamous \u201cyellow band,\u201d apparently due to the the device being backlit from the bottom, can be a bit annoying.**LG G3**Specification wise, it\u2019s great. The resolution is outstanding, It seems to get bright enough and contrast is alright. LG absolutely ruins it with whatever sharpening nonsense they\u2019ve turned on. **HTC One M8**The One has a  great panel. It\u2019s a bit sharper than the Z2 being .2\u201d smaller, you won\u2019t notice the difference in practice. Colors are good, it gets very bright and blacks are nice and deep.**Moto X**Honestly it\u2019s a bit low-res. Brightness is ok. Colors are bit wonky. Thankfully it\u2019s not pentile. The fact that it\u2019s AMOLED allows the incredibly awesome active display to be a killer app. Certainly not the best display around, nor the best part of this device.**iPhone 5S**Wonderful color and contrast, quite a bit lower resolution than the others. The display is accurate and a good example of resolution not being everything.  **Nexus 5**It\u2019s got a competent 1920 x 1080 panel. Colors are accurate. Viewing angles are a bit weird when looking diagonally. No complaints about brightness.     _________________________>**Sound****Sony Xperia Z2**The speakers are pointed in the right direction. They\u2019re not nearly as loud or clear as the M8, but just the fact that they\u2019re front firing earns major points. They look incredibly slick tucked away in the bezel as well. Optional noise-canceling via the sony earbuds you may receive in your box. **OnePlus One**Fairly loud stereo speakers. They\u2019re downward-firing, which isn\u2019t ideal, but quite a lot better than back-firing. **LG G3**Really not great. I\u2019ve been spoiled by the other devices. It\u2019s gets somewhat loud, but it\u2019s a mono speaker facing the wrong way. It\u2019s an unimpressive effort.**HTC One M8**Just fantastic. Completely in a league of it\u2019s own here. I love just putting on some tunes and throwing it on the bed while doing laundry or something. The thing is a portable jam box. **Moto X**Shockingly loud and decent sounding. The single solitary speaker faces the wrong way however. You will absolutely be able to hear the speaker phone or a ringtone.**iPhone 5S**Not terrific or terrible. An adequate bottom-firing speaker. Terrific quality via some decent headphones.**Nexus 5**Pretty terrible. One of my huge complaints with the phone. I\u2019ve heard later versions enlarged the speaker holes, but I don\u2019t see that improving the overall performance significantly. Unimpressive.     _________________________>**Camera****Sony Xperia Z2**It\u2019s a pretty terrific 20.7MP shooter with a nice big lens. Lots of shooting modes, a great viewfinder and a **terrific** shutter button make using the camera a dream.**OnePlus One**The 13MP sensor seems to do fairly well. Cyanogen\u2019s built in software lets you tweak a great many things. A gesture to launch the camera with the phone locked is incredibly handy. **LG G3**It\u2019s a solid performing 13MP camera with \u201cOIS+\u201d. The laser-autofocus really does lead to quick focus acquisition and the ability to snap some pretty quick shots. The camera UI is a bold move (at least in the default mode) but i\u2019m not thrilled about them moving the software buttons while shooting. **HTC One M8**Certainly the most controversial among the group. It\u2019s a physically large sensor that can grab a lot of light. Dynamic range seems quite limited, and it\u2019s *definitely* resolution-challenged. \u201cDuo Camera\u201d can come up with some pretty cool shots. I actually look forward to HTC further improving on this in the future. **Moto X**Absolutely nothing special. It\u2019s 10MP \u201cclear pixel\u201d shooter is adequate. The real killer feature is the ability to launch with a couple flicks of the wrist. You\u2019re unlikely to miss a shot you\u2019re looking for.**iPhone 5S**A great camera made even better by great camera software. Colors are good and the UI is easy to use. **Nexus 5**The Nexus 5 camera experience has improved substantially over the device\u2019s lifespan. Google\u2019s new camera app is finally in the realm of \u201cgood.\u201d OIS helps relieve some blurring. What used to be a poor experience is much closer to the a great one.    _________________________>**Battery Life****Sony Xperia Z2**This thing is absolutely loaded with a 3200 mAh battery. Various stamina modes and tweaks can extend its lifespan even further. I've not needed any of these tweaks and often find myself with around 50% after a day of use and being connected to android wear. **OnePlus One**The OPO comes equipped with a 3100 mAh beast of a battery. In a phone this large you\u2019ve got plenty of room for juice. Certainly enough to get you through the day. **LG G3**Yet another device stuffed with a large 3000 mAh battery. I find the battery life to be similar to that of the Oneplus or the Z2.**HTC One M8**The M8 comes in slightly smaller than some other 2014 flagships at 2600 mAh. It Seems to last longer than it has any right to. I imagine you can credit HTC with some slick software tweaks.**Moto X**The Moto X lasts me through a full day with bluetooth on. The 2200 mAh battery is hardly extravagant now, but thanks to a very picky hardware package and a display that draws a tiny amount of power, the Moto X can last a while. **iPhone 5S**In the android world this 1560 mAh battery would be positively miniscule. I use this as my work phone and occasionally it will need a charge when I get home before hitting the sack. The fact that it can last as long as it does is a testament to tight software engineering. **Nexus 5**I\u2019ve read countless complaints about this online, but personally it always seemed just fine to me. It\u2019s not a massive battery at 2300 mAh, but it\u2019s hardly tiny. I never had issues making it through the day.     _________________________>**Performance****Sony Xperia Z2**The Z2 is certainly not shy on specs. Some parts of navigating the UI seem a bit slower than they should, such as the task switcher. **OnePlus One**Top notch specs loaded with Cyanogen make the OPO ridiculously fast. Nary a slowdown to be seen anywhere. It\u2019s a great experience. **LG G3**You might think this would be pretty rough with that massive display to power, but like the Z2 and the Oneplus One the G3 is packed to the brim with nice silicon. The task switcher can be a bit slow and you can certainly slow it down a bit with lots of graphical work, but it\u2019s speedy and a pleasure to use most of the time. **HTC One M8**Ridiculously fast. No complaints about speed on this device. The M8 makes for a terrific experience. **Moto X**It feels a bit slower these days than it did last year, but the clean build of Android and the fast file-system make the phone a joy to use. It\u2019s not the fastest android device, but it\u2019s certainly not the slowest.**iPhone 5S**iOS is tight and enjoyable. The 5S has some top-notch hardware under the hood. Graphics fly and I don\u2019t recall any non-network related slowdowns since I\u2019ve owned it. **Nexus 5**It\u2019s fast. When I first got my Nexus 5 and compared it to the Moto X is was noticeably quicker. The task switcher is incredibly fast, and everything is wonderfully responsive.     _________________________>**UI****Sony Xperia Z2**Simple, Clean, and very little bloat. The \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d section sharing Google Now\u2019s lock ring is quite annoying, but sony hasn\u2019t done anything truly offensive here. Sony\u2019s \u201cXperia\u201d apps are a great deal if one uses any Sony services. **OnePlus One**Excellent. Cyanogen is still a great experience and having it baked in to a phone straight from the OEM is a trend I really want to see continue. It\u2019s clean, customizable, theme-able, and a joy to use. **LG G3**LG seems to be finding something other than Samsung \u201cMe-too\u201d to model their identity on. It\u2019s a bit heavy handed in places with the theming and changes. There are some really great additions here as well like the clipboard tray, and their lock-screen animations. **HTC One M8**Sense has gotten much lighter and much better. It certainly has it\u2019s own visual style and it\u2019s changes with the times to a more flat modern look. Some of senses drives me insane though like making 10 alarms the maximum you can set. Sometimes changes seem to be made for no reason. **Moto X**Mostly vanilla kit-kat with some incredibly useful additions. Love it**iPhone 5S**Certainly the odd man out for not running Android. iOS has it\u2019s own pros and cons that I won\u2019t even begin to wade into here. **Nexus 5**Android Google-Styled. Some Nexus-only features like the Google Now Launcher, and the \u201cSmart\u201d dialer came pre-loaded here. Nexus devices are hardly AOSP these days, but they are quite clean.    _________________________>**Other Features and Thoughts****Sony Xperia Z2**Full IP 58 waterproofing is a spectacular thing. I absolutely love that I can take this thing in the pool, the rain, or the shower. The camera shutter button mentioned earlier is a killer feature that every single device should have. The charging dock makes night-time charging a breeze. **OnePlus One**The lock-screen gestures make some common tasks quick and easy to do. The charging cable, though a minor detail, is a very slick cable with some clear thought put into it.**LG G3**The back buttons are unique and better than on the G2. It\u2019s nice to have clean sides on a device as I\u2019m always pushing the volume rocker on accident on the M8. An IR blaster is present if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. Knock-on and Knock-code are terrific. **HTC One M8**This M8 has a horrible sleep\/wake button. An IR blaster is up top which can be handy. If cases are your thing, the Dot-view seems to be a pretty clever and unique way to protect your device. 6 months of \u201cbroken screen\u201d protection is a very welcome bonus thrown in. **Moto X**Touchless control, active display, assist, and the camera gesture are excellent examples of how OEMs can add value. These things are terrific additions that are incredibly hard to leg of of once you\u2019ve used them. Some little things motorola does make the experience a blast too: Windy day, and changing boot animations.**iPhone 5S**The fingerprint reader (\u201cTouchID\u201d) is a brilliant implementation. It works well and in a way that doesn\u2019t fundamentally alter your usage. iOS 8 looks to bring some really clever and interesting features, especially if you own a mac.**Nexus 5**Not much to say here, you get a bare-bones, but wonderful android experience. **EDIT** There is more to say, I forgot to mention the QI wireless charging! It's terrific.     _________________________>**Overall****Sony Xperia Z2**If I *had* to pick one device to recommend, it would be this. Great camera, great software, great specs, and waterproof to top it off. It\u2019s a travesty that sony didn\u2019t bring this to the USA in a more timely fashion.**OnePlus One**If you can get an invite and tolerate a gigantic phone it\u2019s a great choice. Cyanogen makes the experience terrific and customizable. The price is absolutely in a league of its own. **LG G3**I don\u2019t think I place it above the Z2. If you must have a bigger screen and higher res then this is a great choice. **HTC One M8**If sound and aluminum are important to you, it\u2019s a great choice. The phone itself is terrific at any rate.**Moto X**It\u2019s a bit late to buy one right now, but one still wouldn\u2019t be making a mistake. The in hand feel, great software, added features, and customization options make the Moto X unique and great device. It\u2019s my overall favorite handset I\u2019ve used. **iPhone 5S**If you want iOS, buy this device. The phone is great and there\u2019s a reason they sell a ton of them. **Nexus 5**If you want a nexus or a pure android experience off-contract and for a terrific price, buy one.     _________________________I hope all that helped or at least entertained some people!","560":"EDITsomething: Alright, thanks again everyone for the questions.

Since I was already in the Android\/Samsung ecosystem, and my girlfriend already has the iPad Pro, I took the bullet and bought the Galaxy Tab S6. Here is my in-depth review after using it for about 8 months:# DisplayThis is the highlight of this device. I will say it: The **Galaxy Tab S6 has the best looking \\~10\" display you can get on any device today**. It's vivid, contrasty, bright, and has excellent viewing angles. The main advantage is the fact that it's a large version of the AMOLED panel used on Samsung's flagship phones. I have the new MacBook Pro 13\", iPad Pro and a Galaxy S10 to compare, and I can't think of a better device to watch movies or play games than the Tab S6. It doesn't have the 120hz refresh rate of the iPad Pro, but for my use case of watching Netflix, reading eBooks, and playing some popular games (CoD Mobile, PUBG, Asphalt), all of which fall under 60fps, this 60hz AMOLED display wins over a 120hz LCD display. For more latency-sensitive use like drawing, and playing certain games, then the iPad Pro has an advantage. Worth mentioning that the Tab S7 that's right around the corner, will likely have 120hz support as well.# SpeakerThe Tab S6 comes with a quad-speaker set up. It's loud, clear, and balanced. It's better than my (gf's) iPad Pro (2019) and almost as good as my MacBook Pro 13 speaker (which is regarded as having one of the best speakers for a laptop). Listening to music, watching movies or gaming is quite enjoyable on these. The speaker also seems to change its audio profile\/direction depending on your screen rotation dynamically.# DesignThe design is premium and sturdy. The design on the Tab S6 is as good as it can get for a modern tablet. I do wish they had an IP rating, but that's something the iPad Pro also lacks. The S-Pen sticks to the back of the tablet. At first, I thought this was weird, especially if you are going to lay down your tablet flat. However, pretty much any case which would flatten the bump and makes it look like the S-Pen is in a tiny hidden pocket. I think some even might prefer this over the iPad Pro approach (which adds extra width).# BatteryThe battery lasts all day of continuous usage. Standby time has been pretty good for me as well, even after leaving it on standby for some days. Overall, I have no complaints in this department.# PerformanceThis is one of the smoothest\/fastest devices I've used, even after 8 months. The old days of Samsung's laggy software are long gone. The Tab S6 handles everything you throw at it with a breeze. Games, multi-tasking, and just general usage are lag-free and fast. It comes with the latest UFS 3.0 storage which is an upgrade over the UFS 2.1 on the S10. One UI 2 update even brought some nice animations changes. # SoftwareYou would think Samsung would slap on their One UI that's on their phones and be done with it, but Samsung did add small but noticeable tablet-specific optimizations and features here and there. The S-Pen and Samsung Dex integration are well done. You can use Samsung Dex straight from your tablet without having to use a second monitor, which is pretty cool. I also really like the new gesture system on One UI 2.1. I no longer have to reach all the way to the bottom just to go back. Overall, I like the software. The system layouts are pretty intuitive and optimized for a tablet. Speaking of layouts...# App scalingI've been pretty surprised by how well Android apps work on devices with varying screen sizes. I can't think of any app where I thought the layout was bothering me. I guess if Android apps work well on ChromeOS, foldables, and Samsung Dex, they should work fine on a tablet.Some Google apps like YouTube, many Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and My Files have some tablet optimizations. By tablet optimizations, I mean letting you see a bit more content at once. I think they are a nice touch, but I don't think they are an absolute necessity on Android since Android already handles app scaling pretty well.Apps without tablet optimizations work way better than they do on an iPad. Instagram, for example, has massive letterboxing on an iPad. [Whereas on an Android, it's full screen.](https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/daniel_scuteri\/status\/1265102390782382080) Some might argue Android is just \"enlarging\" the app, but I would say most people would prefer that over a miniature version of the app. Plus, most Android apps make use of the larger screen real estate by displaying more content (for example, more songs on Spotify and more emails at once on Tab S6 vs. S20).# S-PenThese are just bigger versions of the S-Pen on the Note series, which are pretty good. Compared to the iPad Pro, the latency could be better, but that's more of a display refresh rate issue.The biggest problem is the lack of apps that make use of the pen. Some apps like Dropbox Paper have excellent iPad pencil support but no Android pen support. I've found Samsung Notes to be the best at note-taking when it comes to the S-Pen support. Hopefully, more widespread adoption of the Galaxy Note\/Fold 2 series will help drive more S-Pen support in apps.# Main gripes* Slow updates. I got the Android 10 One UI 2 update a month ago, May 2020. That's pretty late to the party. Some parts of the world got it months earlier but the US got it last. The One UI 2 on S10 was released late Nov 2019, which makes you wonder why it took so long. Security updates are also slow. I get security updates every three months, but my S10 gets them monthly? I am not sure why there's a vast discrepancy in update speed between Samsung's devices. Likely the issue is a mix of long QA testing, limited resources, and carriers taking their time.* Fingerprint scanner. In the past, the FP scanner had 60% success rate. Nowadays, on the newer version of the software, I think it's pretty good at a \\~85% success rate. Still could be better, but these optical fp scanners are surprisingly more accurate to wet, sweaty fingers than the old capacitive fp scanners.* Camera. It's acceptable. It's a single 12MP camera that is not as good as the S10's camera. I've tried GCAM ports on it, and they do seem to improve picture quality. Tablets have always had weaker cameras than phones, and this is not an exception.* Poor thermal management when charging. If I'm playing a graphically intensive game while charging, the frame-rate drops 10 minutes in. My S10 does not do this, even though they have the same SoC, and the tablet has a larger surface area for heat dissipation. I guess that the Tab S6 lacks the liquid cooling of the S10 and\/or the system doesn't correctly slow its charging speed under load.# Final thoughtsThe Tab S6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. Every time I use this device, I can't help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. A lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. The Tab S6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best Android tablet, or the best 10\" entertainment device, I think this tablet should be #1 on your list.Edit: Added a performance section","562":"Hey guys, you might have noticed a pretty deceiving trend for like 2-3 years now. The headphone jack has disappeared from a lot of smartphones recently, however, it's starting to come back a little bit (notable with the ROG Phone 2, Google Pixel 3a...). Removing the headphone jack is an absolute anti-consumer choice,  even if you don't listen to music that much or if you use bluetooth headphones, you still don't have a single reason to defend the removal of that port, you may have personal reasons to use Bluetooth but you have no reasons to defend an anti-consumer practice like that.That being said, here is all the advantages that an headphone jack gives to the user:* Way better sound quality. As sound is an analog thing and the jack is also analog, it goes pretty well. The sound on an headphone jack is the absolute best you can have if you're not a true music enthusiast using full-sized jacks.* No latency. Especially, on Bluetooth peripherals. This is a very bad problem with Bluetooth sound right now, it's starting to become way less of a problem than before but it's still annoying.  The latency problem is especially real when you try to watch livestreams, about 20 minutes or more after starting to watch, you will notice that the sound is starting to desync with the video... Making bluetooth an unusable system for livestreaming purposes...* No interferences. Again, this is especially noticable on Bluetooth. The more of BT peripherals you use, the more you are prone to interferences. If you got too much of this peripherals, you won't be able to sync your headphones at all or would be victim of an horrible sound experience.* No concerns about battery life. If you use Bluetooth, you will need to charge your headphones before using them. Even if it's like every 1 or 2 days.* You can keep a well built jack-based headphones for a decade. As Bluetooth headphones uses Li-Ion batteries, they have a short lifespan, however, a jack headphone don't have that problem.* The most easy-to-use connection for headphones. You don't have to tweak in the settings or try multiple times to sync your headphones. It just works (>!Oh, that reminds me of Bethesda's E3...!<).* The most reversible port for audio. Simple enough, the headphone jack is just a circle, that means that you can put it any direction you want. USB-C\/Lightning is only reversible on two sides.* You can use multiple headphones with it. Using a simple headphone splitter (usually included with your headphones unless you use earphones...), you can listen to music along with your friend. It is possible on certain circumstances on other connection types, like the select few phones that allows to connect 2 BT headphones or one of the dongles for USB-C.* No shitty dongles needed. If you already got an headphone jack on your phone, you don't have to be scared to break something that a fruity company sells for 30$. You don't have the risk of breaking or losing a tiny adapter. Also, those dongles still can't be at the same level of a native headphone jack.* Headphone Jack cables are more durable than USB-C. I've seen a lot of USB-C break when you simply use them for charging (It was however a large progression over MicroUSB which could break by only charging 2 times.)* You can connect some specific peripherals to it. A lot of TVs this days are still using IR Remotes, with an headphone jack, you can simply bring back the IR port if you need so, or use a Radio Emitter. Yep, those are specific needs for certain types of peoples but the option is still nice.* It gives you more option. Even if a phone has an headphone jack, you can still use Bluetooth or USB-C headphones, it simply gives more choice to the consumer.* The headphone jack doesn't really take that much space. Take a look at the iPhone 7\/8, they didn't used space \"gained\" by removing the headphone jack, in fact, every phones except a couple of very tiny ones don't use that space.Also, Samsung managed to provides a 4000mAh battery, IP68 certification and a stylus that's as long as the phone with the Note 9, along with the headphone jack. Asus managed to put a 6000mAh battery and a FAN inside the Rog Phone 2, also with a jack. The headphone jack doesn't take that much space inside the phone...* You don't want a phone that's thinner than an headphone jack. Companies will say that the remove the headphone jack for making their phone thinner, however, a phone that's as thin as a paper page isn't ergonomic and nice to use...* You can use your headphone jack across every device (except a few smartphones). You can use an headphone jack on every console as of right now, every computer (except Macs but again it's Apple), every recent cars, every TV... USB-C headphones are only compatible with a select number of devices where Bluetooth is still missing from certains consoles...&#x200B;The headphone jack is still, as of right now, the best way to connect headphones. I'm not saying that in future years the USB-C audio wouldn't be better than the jack but as of right now, removing it is one of the most stupid decisions you can do when making a smartphone right now... You wouldn't get anything by removing it...&#x200B;I would recommend everyone to boycott, if they want to, every phone without a jack, even if you don't care, this is just an anti-consumer decision...&#x200B;Yeah, this is a 200 years old connection but as of right now there's not any better alternative, so why remove it?&#x200B;\\#NoJackNoBuy if you wanna start a trend ;)I'm glad to see newer phones with an headphone jack.","563":"I'm someone who has used many flagship Android phones in the past 6 years - namely LG G4, S6 Edge+, S7 Edge, S9 and S10+. I'm an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I'm not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I've used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bg2bb2\/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bo2ohn\/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10\/).I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4\" S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the \"smaller\" Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the \"smaller\" iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).**Performance & Software Experience**The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won't know the feeling that I'm talking about.For sure, I miss the S10+'s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It's really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience\/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone's software is usually supported for \\~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I'm wrong).**Processor Disparity**The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What's even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won't be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US\/Hong Kong\/South Korea\/Canada?). It's like you're using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying.\u00a0This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won't have to think about importing.**RAM Management**Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don't need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it's not a huge deal since the iPhone's performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.**Display**The S10+\u00a0has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn't bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn't overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+'s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in *Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration*\u00a0and *Camera*), so I'm not too annoyed at that.\u00a0For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro's cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I'm someone who can always tell the difference between FHD\/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6\/S7\/S9\/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than \"One Hand Operations\" and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can't put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro's slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.**Camera**Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR'd. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black\/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom\/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn't soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I'd still be fine with it today.\u00a0Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+'s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone's.**Physical Build**This is all preference here, and I think they're both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.**Inputs and Storage**The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn't enough for me. A \"pro\" phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.**Battery**The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I'm regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I'll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro's battery holds up.Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.**Speakers**Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It's just slightly louder I think.**Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness**For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have [annoying and intrusive ads](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DTqN7Uqr.jpg) on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don't want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don't want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don't want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it's not a huge deal.For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn't mean all apps are \"bad\" on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don't use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like \"Samsung Browser\", \"Samsung Health\" and \"Sound Assistant\" from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you'll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like \"PaymentFramework UI\" update from Galaxy Store, or \"Billing\" or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung\/Android just feels a bit weird.**File Management**S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.\u00a0**Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button**I personally don't like to use my voice too much, but here's my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn't a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into \"car mode\" when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can't just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn't perfect.The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don't like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn't have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.**Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration**The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn't that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it's just a camera image based scanner so it isn't secure at all, doesn't work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber\/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn't turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn't have an issue with!\u00a0 The iPhone's proximity sensor works fine.Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a \"loose vibration\" where as the iPhone vibration feels more \"compact and precise\" - hard to describe.Overall, the biometrics, sensors and \"little things\" are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.**Contactless Payment**Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+\u00a0 the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn't available. So when someone gives you the \"we don't have pay-wave\", you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I've only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn't bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it's located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn't a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.**Price ($AUD) and Value**Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be that much more expensive than an S10+.However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.**Verdict**Taking all these factors into account, right now I'd personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.Since I obviously like writing about tech, I started my own [blog](https:\/\/tech22space.blogspot.com\/) if you are interested.","564":"Do you like this recap?

","565":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","567":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","568":"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r\/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I\u2019m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience. [Here is a link to the old post, in case you\u2019re interested.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1w3woc\/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and\/) ##There are two ways of approaching this post:1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you\u2019ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills. **What is Java?** Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.  **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language** This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:     String name = \"Dennis\";     String surname = \"Cometti\";     String FullName = name + \" \" + surname;  After this runs, the variable FullName will equal \u201cDennis Cometti\u201d.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0). I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a \u2018Quote\u2019 Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person. **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English** All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:     String name = \"DENNIS\";     name = name.toLowerCase();  It couldn\u2019t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted \u201cDENNIS\u201d (\"dennis\") to the 'name' variable.After you have typed \u2018name.\u2019 Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance. **Classes, methods and objects in Java** \u2022     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain \u201cDennis\u201d and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89. \u2022     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView. \u2022     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car. \u2022     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects. **So what is the difference between classes and objects?** A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car). A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be a \u2018name\u2019 (containing the String \u201cDennis\u201d). If you are confused, don\u2019t worry, once you have followed the instructions you\u2019ll understand it much clearer. **Some Java related resources** - [The basics of Java](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)- [The syntax of Java](http:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/java\/java_basic_syntax.htm)  ##How do you get started making an app?  **Get Android Studio**Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don\u2019t let the words confuse you \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You\u2019ll come across many things you don\u2019t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn\u2019t need them for this exercise). #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don\u2019t open it yet.]( https:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html) **Strings in Android**Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.[Here\u2019s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http:\/\/developer.android.com\/guide\/topics\/resources\/string-resource.html) **How Android Studio works**Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won\u2019t be using many. When you create a new \u2018Project\u2019 (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.[This screenshot shows what it generates](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HOX9B7S.png)This looks quite complex but it\u2019s actually quite simple. For example the \u2018layout\u2019 folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you\u2019ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.     #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.> #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button. #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/o7NdR) #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http:\/\/imgur.com\/JM4BIMV.png) #Instruction #6:The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/pRisAsPFThis has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from \u201cTap the screen to begin\u201d to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color. #Instruction #7:Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3I7v9You\u2019ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.You will see \u2018public class Quote{}\u2019, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/VhHbWwSN Just click OK to any popup boxes.What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you \u2018instantiate\u2019 the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon. #Instruction #8:Click on the Quotebook class here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bG2d0VD.pngThen copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/wz8gbWWAYou\u2019ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable\/line: int count = 0;This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/3FXi14XZ     #Explanation time!     setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);     RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);  The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.____________________     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();      Quote quote1 = new Quote(\"You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck.\", \"Troy Barnes\");     quoteList.add(quote1);      Quote quote2 = new Quote(\"Cool Beans\", \"Rod Kimble\");     quoteList.add(quote2);  The first line here creates an Array\/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called \u2018quoteList\u2019. The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person\u2019s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.____________________This is where it gets a little tricky:     touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            @Override            public void onClick(View view) {                 if (count < quoteList.size()) {                    Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());                    count = count + 1;                 } else{                     count = 0;            }}});  This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.   #Instruction #9:Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018values-v21\u2019, they should both contain a file called styles.xmlIn the \u2018values\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar\" In the \u2018values-v21\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar\" This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes. #Instruction #10:To do this next step, you have to:- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed. - [Enable Developer Settings](http:\/\/www.greenbot.com\/article\/2457986\/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging. - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio\/ADB) Then, you have to click the [green play button](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app! If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers\/android studio. #Instruction #11:Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines. Change the font, colours, formatting or use.Share your own versions in the comments! #If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development. **Libraries** Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.

Wired brushes off most of the technical details and the paper didn't cover [android's File Based Encryption](https:\/\/source.android.com\/security\/encryption\/file-based) very well which I think needs some clarity on it. The paper draws the correct conclusion though and what should be improved in successor android versions.----------In android 7+, `\/data` partition is encrypted by **File Based Encryption** (FBE) on first boot by default. FBE keys are generated in **hardware-backed keystore**. FBE keys are encrypted in keystore with the key derived from user's screen lock password. So unless you enter correct password, keystore cannot decrypt FBE keys. When you reboot your device, it is in **Before First Unlock** (BFU) state which means the user has yet to unlock screen first time since reboot. In this state, if someone calls you or messages you, their name won't show up unless you unlock your screen. That's because the device is waiting for your lock screen password which is to be used to decrypt FBE keys and FBE keys are encrypting your contact names.Once you unlock your screen first time since reboot, it goes to **After First Unlock** (AFU) state which means the user has unlocked the device first time since reboot. Further locking and unlocking won't revert the state unless you reboot again which throws you back on BFU.----------**Temporary per-boot key**: In AFU state, FBE keys are decrypted by the keystore and are immediately re-encrypted again by a temporary per-boot key. Per-boot key is generated & stored by keystore and its validity is until next reboot. Encrypted FBE keys blob is then **cached** in `\/system\/vold`. This ensures that FBE keys are never in plain text when cached by the OS.----------As FBE keys are cached though encrypted, you can now use your biometric to unlock screen and kernel can request keystore to decrypt FBE keys on demand means whenever an application wants to read and write, kernel will load FBE keys in memory and they will remain in memory until next reboot. That's because running apps need them for read and write even if you lock your screen. E.g. To display contacts on lock screen, sharing live location, listening to music, sync services, etc. they need those keys in memory else they won't work on locked screen.This opens a security hole. Users don't often reboot their devices for months so it is in AFU state. The intruder and law enforcement can extract those keys from memory to decrypt sensitive data of running applications without knowing your screen lock. **This procedure requires carefully exposing the SoC without disconnecting the battery.**----------iOS encrypts personal data with keys that are evicted from memory 10 seconds after locking the screen. When it is in BFU state, iPhone needs password to derive a **Class key**. At this time, biometric won't work. When it is in AFU state, it caches **Class key** in Secure Enclave. Now user can use biometric and cached Class key is used to re-derive those evicted keys again when screen is locked and unlocked.----------This keys eviction feature is what android also needs otherwise if the intruder is able to decrypt whole `\/data` partition, he can own that data in it or if he wants to own the stolen device and doesn't care about the data, he could be able to set `enable` bit for OEM unlocking. Thent he can go to bootloader mode and unlock the bootloader.> In most cases, FBE keys also undergo an additional key derivation step in the kernel in order to generate the subkeys actually used to do the encryption, for example per-file or per-mode keys.If FBE keys are compromised, so will sub-keys so this derivation step doesn't add much protection even if sub-keys are evicted in newer versions. Android should keep FBE key bundle in keystore itself and load sub-keys in memory some of which can be evicted after screen lock.Law enforcement can just force your fingerprint to unlock your device and can lie about that in court that it was already unlocked at the time of arrest so no kind of device security can stop them. Locks deter only honest people.----------Most common questions:1. Why biometric doesn't work after reboot?- After reboot, the device is in BFU state and waiting for you to enter PIN\/password which can be used to derive key that decrypts FBE keys.2. How does biometric decrypt FBE keys again when the user locks and unlocks the screen second time (or Nth time)?- It doesn't. FBE keys were already decrypted by the keystore when the screen was unlocked first time since reboot (They are re-encrypted by a different key and cached, see temporary per-boot key section). When you unlock using biometric, keystore lets the OS know that the user is verified and should be allowed access. This is enforced by SELinux policy.3. I forgot my PIN\/password, why do I need to factory reset the device to use my phone? That would erase all my data.- Your PIN\/password is used to derive key that encrypts and decrypts FBE keys as explained in the post. If you have forgotten your PIN\/password, your data cannot be decrypted anyway so even if there was a feature to reset PIN without factory reset, it would be useless. Instead it would allow thieves to reset PIN and reuse your device.4. If data partition is not decrypted until you enter your password, where does the phone store things like language, wallpaper, wifi logins, Bluetooth pairings that are visible right after the phone boots?- I intentionally left out this part that FBE has 2 types of storage:  Device Encrypted Storage: This is directly encrypted by keystore and do not require your password for decryption.  Credentials Encrypted Storage: This is encrypted with a key derived from your password.  The most basic functionalities are encrypted under device encrypted storage so that your phone will be still usable for taking calls and receiving messages even if you don't unlock it.5. **While in lockdown mode, my contact names are still showing up on call**- I checked in settings and it says that it **turns off smart lock, fingerprint and notifications on lock screen**. So it doesn't clear keys in memory probably because Google wants to ensure usability of background apps like listening to music. This means it may disable biometric for law enforcement but won't put your phone back in BFU state.  Android apps process cycle isn't designed to adapt if FBE keys are suddenly cleared from memory without letting the apps know. It would instantly crash most of the system apps and services because of I\/O error when they couldn't find keys. In iOS, apps are alerted that the user has locked the device.6. Why can't biometric be used as a key to decrypt FBE keys?- Because you always put your finger slightly differently on the sensor. Keystore approves authentication if enough of the mathematical values match. To use something as a key or to derive a key from something, you need something that doesn't change and always produces the same output.7. What about multi-user phones? I have a dummy profile set up and if I never unlocked my main profile after reboot I can't see it's files from it.  But if I have unlocked previously I see them.- If multi-user profiles are set up, keys can be recovered for currently running user only. When you switch user, keys for earlier user are cleared from memory. That's another good way to stay safe without rebooting the device.8. Wait, why is only `\/data` partiton encrypted, but system partitons are not?- You don't need encryption for system partitions. Other partitions are already public images. What you need is their integrity protection. All system partitions are protected by [android verified boot 2.0](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/external\/avb\/+\/master\/README.md)----------**Post is archived**?

We love the updates for the new functionalities, increased stability or even for the sake of having a higher number buried on \"about the phone\" section. However it all goes to waste when companies, in this case, oneplus, break and\/or limit functionalities which were working good, with a new update iteration.    In this particular case, when the nougat update first started to roll out, people noted strange behaviors when using third party cameras (the ones that rely on camera2 API). Under some situations, the phones would hang for a long long time, crash, and display strange artifacts on the viewfinder. As it impacted heavily the phone camera usage, these issues were massively reported on oneplus forums, twitter and xda. (even by the creator of the known OpenCamera). Despite that, they got ignored, report after report, and still, to this day, almost a year later, there wasn't any official position on the issue      On the other hand, using the stock camera app won't reveal any issues. Why? Because it's using a modded legacy API (with HAL3 for the front camera according to sultanxda) to make it work. (The fact that an OEM is still using this method in 2017\/18 would deserve its own discussion, but I will leave as it is, since it's not particularly relevant for this topic). But, as you may ask, if the stock camera works seamlessly, why do we need to rely on 3rd party ones?    Several reasons tbh:    - Useless panorama mode  - **Lack of more advanced controls like intervalometer, exposure metering mode**  - **Lack of manual video settings**  - Low quality 1080p time lapse mode  - No sound with slow motion  - (you tell me) \/s    For those who might have interest on the topic, I'll shed this additional information.    - The camera will always crash during when pointed to bright scenes under some combinations of ISO and shutter speed.    - The exif data (ISO and shutter speed) is incorrectly reported on dark scenes    - Using full auto will allow higher than 799 ISO to be picked by the camera (despite the live stats of the app only read as 799). As soon as you force a manual control, the usable ISO range will be 100-799. Any higher than that and it is the same as 799.    These itself result on a partially useless camera2 API implementation which, if it wasn't enough already, make the phone unstable for every user. All it takes is a camera app download from the play store.

Can't just understand how can oneplus have a device unstable for a year without the intention to fix that. I'm really trying to bring attention to this as it is not a minor bug at all.    If this post leads to nowhere, at least I'm trying to inform people of the oneplus *modus operandi*. I still think their hardware is awesome (including my OP3T) but these decisions and the lacking support push me away from a future buy.  Never settle you say?      -        **TL;DR: Oneplus broke the camera2api since nougat update. Refuses to fix it, there are no official answers, despite it being reported countless times. All OP3(T) on nougat or oreo are not stable. Will face reboots and crashes under some usage patterns due to this problem**  **EDIT:**Thanks for the support guys!I've uploaded two videos showing the bug to make our message more clear.[Max\/Reported ISO bug](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWPgj82vIqM)[Phone Crashing and turning unresponsive](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NWA5Sws8rQA)I believe that we, android users, should have to option to choose. It's even more valid if we consider that our phone was marketed for, not only obviously, enthusiasts. That's why we fight to have the api working again. There are people who will find use in being able to shoot 500 30 secs 3200 ISO RAW photos 10 seconds to each other. Other will find the ability to shoot log video at a fixed 1\/48 exposure @24p to post produce later on computer. Other will just download GCAM mod and find that actually we can get some flagship level shots from this phone. That's all about what an open and enthusiast phone should be. I simply refuse to accept the situation which looks like a half made job. It's even worse when your new product suffers from similar issues. Oneplus has the funds and dimension to correct address this problem. There's no way a phone with a 440\u20ac price tag can be unstable when using any legit camera app, from the playstore itself, as long as it uses the HAL3.**EDIT2:** There's a petition up and running that Agent 8923 linked @ comments section[LINK](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/oneplus-oneplus-stop-ignoring-customers-and-fix-the-oneplus-3t-camera)**EDIT3:** Got a reddit PM from oneplus support. I know it does not mean much as lots of us reported the problem via submission forms and oneplus forums. I've told @oneplus via twitter about the problem 3 times only to be asked to use the bug submition form, which has resulted in nothing. I'm gathering all the info I can (logcats, dumps, crashing patterns, video proof, etc) to send them ASAP (and again lol). I will keep you updated later if it leads to somewhere ","571":"After 7 years with an iPhone, I finally took the plunge to see what I might be missing with Android. I love iOS but the Apple conference for the iPhone 7 didn\u2019t really inspire me to upgrade yet again.So, although my wife, kids and parents are still on iOS and I\u2019ve had over 1200 apps come and go through my phone over the years, I decided I wanted to start afresh.This Reddit thread really helped me with some decision making, and continues to help me learn about new apps, and tips and tricks for ones I have. So here I am, returning the favour, for any other iPhone users who are looking at this thread thinking that they might also want to jump ship.#Out of the BoxSwitching on my shiny new Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S7 - but this article should apply to any Android device running Marshmallow or Nougat) for the first time, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect after 7 years of Apple logos and forced stock apps\u2026After being greeted by a dull opening screen, and the option to plug my Google credentials in, I was left staring at my empty home screen, a Google search bar, a large clock and a weather widget. Almost everything else was hidden in the app drawer. It felt like like a place to hide bloatware - but there wasn\u2019t too much guff in there - although I wasn\u2019t about to start using ugly looking Samsung apps when there was a whole app store waiting to be clicked on.Luckily I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s services for years (I\u2019ve never liked iCloud), so my contacts, email, calendars and photos were synced, and my credit card was already hooked up. A quick setting change to get my fingerprint into the phone, and I would be ready to start my journey. So how did day one compare to my old iPhone? Starting up an iPhone for the first time is a much slicker experience - it feels more welcoming (much in the same way a Mac \u2018feels\u2019 more friendly than a PC) and there was a familiar collection of icons. These days though, those most of those Apple apps feel like crapware, and I rarely use Apple\u2019s stock apps. In fact my iPhone was gradually becoming a Google phone anyway (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, etc).So what else was different...#More ButtonsWith the single \u2018home\u2019 button on the iPhone (not counting the volume, power or mute switch), there isn\u2019t much to think about (double tap for app-switcher, hold for Siri). Suddenly there are 3 buttons, and muscle memory made it hard to not keep launching the camera when switching apps (ok - this is a Samsung feature - double tap home to launch camera - it\u2019s really useful). However, having a dedicated \u2018back\u2019 button has proved really useful - the \u2018slide from the left to go back\u2019 that Apple has pushed as the standard for \u2018back\u2019, didn\u2019t work with every app, and if you were thrown from one app to another, you had to stretch your fingers to the very top left of the phone to jump back (Note: the Android \u2018back\u2019 button has occasionally confused me, and thrown me out of apps). Switching between apps on Android is also simple (I\u2019m looking forward to Android 7.0 where I can quickly double tap to jump between the previous\/current app). Having a few extra options for navigating around the phone is really quite good.#Voice - Siri vs OK GoogleI quite liked Siri - she didn\u2019t do much, but she was quite funny.However OK-Google is utterly amazing. From being able to ask a song to be played on Spotify (which will likely never be an option on the iPhone), to dictating a reminder, rarely does Google get the speech-to-text wrong (Siri always seemed to write things on a word-by-word basis, but Google seems to look at the whole sentence and change things accordingly). I\u2019m really impressed, and actually use the voice feature now that I feel it is going to be correct more often than not.The other advantage with the dictation on Android is the ability to click a word and be given the options of other words that you \u2018might\u2019 have said - this makes text editing super quick, without feeling like you need to delete stuff and start again.#LEDsLittle flashing lights on my phone. It\u2019s quite handy seeing it blink away at me, without the whole phone springing to life and lighting up the place.#App EquivalentsThis was the biggest hurdle for me. I\u2019ve gone through a LOT of apps over the years (1256 according to my AppShopper account). Some have stayed on the phone for one launch, others have survived many cullings. But some of my most used and beloved apps just don\u2019t exist on Android. So after much MUCH research and testing, here is my list of equivalent apps (I should add, that it\u2019s really refreshing to be able to select your stock apps on Android): - Mail >> Gmail (or Inbox, Outlooks) - Facetime >> WhatsApp (Video Calling) (or Duo - but sadly I don\u2019t know many people using it - Messages >> Textra  - GBoard >> Google Keyboard (although it doesn\u2019t have Gif search - but it does let you use voice to type) (or Swype, Swiftkey) - Apple Maps >> Google Maps (which is by far superior on Android - with widgets and shortcuts) (or Waze) - Tweetbot >> Talon (or Flamingo, Fenix) - Narwhal (for Reddit) >> Sync (for Reddit) - Notes >> OneNote (or Google Keep, Evernote) - Reminders >>ToDoIst (or Google Reminders, Google Now, Inbox, Keep), Wunderlist)#Apps I Miss##WalletGreat for storing store cards, but most of the individual \u2018store card\u2019 apps seem to have a link to their cards anyway.##MessagesThose blue bubbles! You knew you were sending texts and photos without worrying about how they were going to be seen at the other end. WhatsApp is getting close in terms of features though, and the new video calling feature is great.Erm\u2026 that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve now got apps that shout at me when my battery is charged, or read texts when I\u2019m driving (Shouter Pro), apps that let me jump around to other apps (Swiftly Switch) and folder apps (Sold Explorer File Manager). There are even emulator apps for those old school games.#WidgetsThis leads me onto widgets. On iOS they are tucked into notification style boxes, but (for example) having a ToDoIst task list and my calendar widget on a home screen is much more useful. Throwing in shortcuts to a WhatsApp contact or a favourite Dropbox folder, is great (iOS has 3D touch for some shortcuts, but not all apps work with it). #Apps That iOS Will Never Have##NovaThis is the app that has sold me on Android. I can customise my phone to my heart\u2019s content. I\u2019ve been using similar apps for year - do I really need to have their names written on my phone? Just switch the names off! -  I have a massive screen, so do I really only want a small grid of apps? Just change the amount of apps you want along the horizontal and vertical! You can even resize widgets. - Would I like to position those apps into a more useful layout, change their icons (I\u2019ve even created my own custom designs), change the icon size, change how those icons function if I press or swipe on them? All possible with Nova. - Do I want to double tap the screen to text-message, swipe up to search, pinch to jump to voicemail? Yes\u2026 yes I do.OK, there are a LOT of options and even plugins (for things like adding the red notification dots on apps) - BUT the app is super easy to use, and I can\u2019t imagine using my phone without it (I love to tweak things).##Google NowAlthough there is an iOS version that does some of what \u2018Goolge Now\u2019 does on Android, it really doesn\u2019t work that well. On Android I\u2019m only a swipe away from seeing info about what\u2019s around me, stocks, news, weather, where my car\u2019s parked etc. When I went on holiday, it even pulled in my info about flights, hotels, and train links. ##Google Now On TapHold the home key and you can copy text from anywhere on the screen, or have Google act on what\u2019s on the screen. It feels a little gimmicky, but it can be occasionally useful.#Transferring filesThis almost made me take the phone back. I\u2019m used to just sticking a USB into my iPhone and having my Mac suck the photos from it, sync apps and backup. I\u2019d tried a friends Android and plugged it in, and photos and folders where just as easy to deal with. However, my Galaxy S7 just didn\u2019t want to play. After trying numerous apps and getting nowhere, I ended up using Dropbox to sync my photos in the background (which actually turned out great, as they are constantly backed-up now -see my notes on \u2018Background Multitasking).Then I discovered AirMore (I\u2019m now also trying AirDroid) - a couple of clicks, and I can essentially use my phone through my browser. Texting, screenshots, file transfer, folder search, notifications. It\u2019s slick, fast and allows really easy uploading and downloading of anything I throw at it (for example - Android is sensible enough to stick photos in the Gallery just from a quick drag & drop from the computer browser). #App StoreApple wins here - their AppStore is wonderful. Apps seem to be released first on iOS, and there is a greater proportion of solid, slick looking apps and games (my guess is that piracy rates are high and profits are low on Android). The Google Play Store is getting better though - there have been quite a few slick upgrades in just the last few weeks. One big advantage is being able to buy and install apps from your browser (so if I read a good review on my laptop, I can have the app on my phone in a couple of clicks). Also, if the app is not what you hoped, you can get a refund if you go back to the store quickly enough (2 hours I think). However, there are a LOT of poor apps on the store - for example, there may be dozens of texting apps that can become your stock app, but most look like they were designed by some tin-pot hacker looking to jump into your phone and suck its data dry. #Background multitaskingThe classic battery killer - but I\u2019m not finding any apps that churn away at my battery (I ditched the official Facebook app very early on, and moved to \u2018Swipe Pro\u2019 - another recommendation).There are some big advantages to having things run in the background though - my Dropbox happily uploads photos as soon as I\u2019m on Wifi (Dropbox on iOS would stop as soon as the app was in the background). Apps that I want to sync while I\u2019m not watching them are doing their thing, and the info I want it waiting for me (having apps stop working in the background if I\u2019ve not used them for a few days is great as well - as I have a tendency to get excited by new apps, and then forget to use them).#Fingerprint SensorThe sensor works just as well on my Galaxy S7 as it did on my iPhone (although the iPhone would recognise my print even if the phone was the upside-down, which the S7 doesn\u2019t ) - and more apps are starting to use it (thankfully my banking app does now, so typing in crazy long passwords isn\u2019t such an issue now).Throw in 1Password\u2019s keyboard and it only takes a quick fingerprint unlock to put my password into any app or website.#NotificationsI\u2019ve never really felt happy with iOS notifications - they weren\u2019t easily dismissed, some had more info than others, and once you\u2019d looked at them, they were gone from your screen (until you hunted around for the little red numbered dots all over the place, reminding you of how many things you\u2019ve missed). Android gets it right - a quick swipe down and the notifications are there for you to act on. Swipe them back up to see them later , or swipe them to the side to clear them away. I really don\u2019t miss those red dots nagging at me, and I love the more varied way of being able to interact with notifications (my bank app reminds me I\u2019m signed in, and includes a button to sign-out right in the notification bar, Spotify is there with what is playing, or reminders can be snoozed for later). You can also set whether you want the notification to show just the app name, or more info, on an app-by-app basis.#Anything Else?##ProsI stuck in a 128Gb memory card - so offline music and photos are never an issue anymore.##ConsSlow updating to the lastest Android OS - it looks like I\u2019m going to have to wait a few more months until Nougat hits my phone. But if you are going to get a Google Pixel, this won\u2019t be a problem.#ConclusionOn the whole, there isn\u2019t really all that much different about my day-to-day using of Android vs iOS. I still use a Mac and an iPad, and everything plays nicely together. But I do love the shortcuts, customisation of look and feel, and all the tweaking of gestures (via Nova). It feels like *MY* phone, instead of looking like everyone else\u2019s, and has become a good new friend in my pocket.Would I recommend Android? Well\u2026 I still think an average user would get along better with an iPhone - the whole package just works; they back themselves up and never really change much.However, I love to play with my gadgets and iOS was just starting to bore me. It was a really hard decision to jump platforms, but I\u2019m really pleased I did. I feel equally at home on either platform, but I\u2019m really happy to be on Android.Edit: formatting listsEdit 2:Wow. That's a lot of comments so far - and virtually all of them are helpful or inquisitive. I love this subreddit! **What I should add to my review based on feedback:** - Everyone should get Tasker.  - Two apps can be opened at once (a GS7 feature on Android 6, but open to all on Android 7). - No Android Pay in Canada. - No working version of Samsung Pay in Canada. - People really love a lot of different Reddit apps! - This review was really about the OS - there are too many phones and features - love the phone you have. - I've tried every tip to get my phone to be seen by my Mac, and  only Android Transfer worked (but it's a bit underwhelming). However, AirMore and AirDroid still seem like the best options for me (looking into 'Join' and 'PushBullet' though). 'Commander One' for Mac looks interesting too. - Set up a Nova gesture to easily get to Google Now (mine is now swipe up from app drawer) - Saying \"OK Google - Lumos\" and \"OK Google - Nox\" was the funniest tip I received (thanks \/user\/0x6A7232)!Edit 3 & 4: formatting lists (as Markdown suddenly doesn't seem to be working for me!)Edit 5: I've got a screenshot of my new homescreen with apps based on everyones feedback. Thanks! - http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wBvN4wc.png**Note:** The radio app icon is: **1 Radio News Pro: World Radio** (a great way to listen to radio news while brushing my teeth) with a custom Icon from this pack: **Pixel Icon Pack - Apex\/Nova\/Go**","572":"**tl;dr** According to the limited information we have now, *all apps* written for Android M can have access to e-mail addresses of the owner.---Now that we've seen the announcements from I\/O, we've probably all heard of the migration to *[runtime permissions](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM)*, which allow you to be asked for permissions while using the app, as opposed to during installation (a good thing). What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM&t=150) instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/preview\/features\/runtime-permissions.html), even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/frameworks\/base\/+\/android-m-preview\/core\/res\/AndroidManifest.xml) by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/2175688) for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=9621627) for mentioning this permission.)**My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)---*Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.* READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?* CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.* READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.* GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.* SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.* WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.* SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.* MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.* READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.* App names\/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as \"Android System\" or something equally serious.* Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. \"**Offline apps**\" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.If you have any thought on permissions that are inappropriate to grant automatically, please leave a comment. **Did I get something wrong? I'm sorry** - the available information is preliminary and still quite dispersed - again, please leave a comment.","573":"https:\/\/io.google\/2022\/The event will begin at 10:00 AM PDT (when this post is 37 minutes old).[Livestream](https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=nP-nMZpLM1A)[Livestream (ASL)](https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=PeUXBvRExic)[Developer Keynote livestream](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qBkyU1TJKDg)[Developer Keynote livestream (ASL)](https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=ww7RItTgO48)The Pixel 6a, Pixel Buds Pro, and Pixel Watch are expected to be announced during the event, among other things including information about Android 13.

I currently own (too) many of the current flagship devices. [I\u2019ve got the following: Nexus 6, Moto X (2014), HTC M9, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and an iPhone 6.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8s6lCHK.jpg). I\u2019ve still got some of the devices from the last post as well. I\u2019ve sold quite a few others. I figured I\u2019d share my thoughts with all of you just in case it helps anyone make a decision.. I\u2019ll just break my thoughts out into some categories and just wax on for a bit.    _________________________>**Build and Hand Feel:****[Galaxy S6](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/VQUue)***Finally*. It\u2019s seriously long overdue that Samsung makes a device that actually feels this well put together and thought out. I haven\u2019t bought a Samsung device in a long while. It feels good to have another option if you care about a premium build. The glass feels great, the metal is solid, and there are virtually no seems to be found. I do have a slight loose home button that makes a noise when you tap lightly, but that\u2019s my only ,admittedly minor, complaint.**[Galaxy S6 Edge](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bJnUn)**It feels almost identical to its twin. The only real difference is the thinner sides. Swiping from the sides feels a bit \u201cneater\u201d as well. The Edge is just as solid and well put together as the regular Galaxy S6.**[Google Nexus 6](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3fZXg)**Obviously, It\u2019s big. There\u2019s no getting around the fact that it\u2019s a 6 inch display, so the phone can be unwieldy. Having said that, for a 6 inch display, it\u2019s about as good as it gets. The bezels are small, the device has a comfortable curve, and it feels alright in the hand. I really dig Moto\u2019s \u201cpebble\u201d shaped devices, and this is no exception.**[HTC One M9](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/keWuP)**It\u2019s sharp. Both in looks and in feel this thing is shaped *precisely*. I really like the heft and rigidity of the M9. I didn\u2019t think i\u2019d care for the gold at all, but it looks pretty damn smart in person. I need this black bar out of my life to be totally in love, but I really do think it\u2019s a great looking and feeling device.**[Moto X 2014](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TD1tk)**The Moto X, like it\u2019s predecessor, is just a delight to hold. This phone is comfortable with a capital C. I have the bamboo backed version, and I find myself just holding it to touch the back. **[iPhone 6](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/FcfGA)**As always from Apple, build quality is pretty solid. The iPhone 6 is a much more comfortable device than it\u2019s predecessor, with some nicely rounded edges.     _________________________>**Display****Galaxy S6**This is the display I want on every single device I own. I almost hate samsung for not making this available to everyone, because this is how mobile displays should look. I\u2019m a huge pentile hater (from back in the day really,) but I don\u2019t really care about anything subpixel related on the GS6 display, it just doesn\u2019t matter. The screen is fantastic and everyone should go see it at least.**Galaxy S6 Edge**I honestly don\u2019t like this display as much as the regular Galaxy S6. The corners do make for some crazy glare, and there is a bit of color-shift along the edges as well. It\u2019s still a great panel, it\u2019s just not as great as the regular variant.**Google Nexus 6**It\u2019s AMOLED with a lot of pixels. It\u2019s a passable display, but it\u2019s not going to win awards. I am a huge fan of how Motorol integrates their displays\/front panels\/glass. The round edges and lack of a seam is very slick. Blacks are black, and it\u2019s bright enough most of the time.**HTC One M9**After reading all the bad news from AnandTech, I was genuinely worried. I don\u2019t really find it to be any worse than the M8 in person. I do really wish HTC would have pushed some kind of envelope with the panel in their latest, but it is passable. **Moto X 2014**The Moto X display is pretty much the same display as the Nexus 6. Likely some last generation Samsung affair. Everything said about the N6 display (including the good stuff!) applies here.**iPhone 6**Apple\u2019s panel is the lowest resolution of the lot, and with some effort you can notice the lower resolution. Most of the time thought? It doesn\u2019t matter. The panel calibration continues to be excellent and the contrast and max brightness are great. There\u2019s no gap between the layers of the display either.     _________________________>**Sound and speakers****Galaxy S6**A nice loud, mono, speaker pointed in my not-favorite direction.**Galaxy S6 Edge**Same as the S6**Google Nexus 6**This is essentially two of the Moto X 2014 speakers instead of one. The Nexus 6 gets pretty loud, and it\u2019s definitely stereo, which is great. These are just a notch below the M9 in my opinion. **HTC One M9**The stereo speakers sound great. I think \u201cBoomsound\u201d is a tremendously cheesy name for just having two stereo speakers, but that\u2019s not my department. This is the richest sound I\u2019ve heard from a smartphone. **Moto X 2014**This is actually one that might surprise people. The Moto X 2014 has only one speaker, but it\u2019s truly not bad. It gets plenty loud and it sounds not bad. **iPhone 6**The iPhone sounds a lot like the Galaxy S6, but maybe a tad bit quieter.     _________________________>**Camera****Galaxy S6***FINALLY* we have a quick, \u201cgood enough\u201d Android camera with phase detection autofocus (PDAF). Freaking FINALLY. The best android camera I\u2019ve used. If I had to find a complaint, it would be that I prefer a 4:3 sensor to a 16:9 one.**Galaxy S6 Edge**Same as the regular S6.**Google Nexus 6**This is one that kind of bums me out. I really feel as if this camera has potential. However, I also get the feeling that Google is either inept or doesn't care at all about their cameras. **HTC One M9**It\u2019s not great. I feel like most of the blame lies with HTC\u2019s software, rather than the hardware. The lack of PDAF is a bummer and focus really does take *ages*. HTC needed a better showing here by far.**Moto X 2014**It\u2019s OK at best in daylight. It\u2019s not a great camera at all. The only thing it has going for it is the twist launch gesture, which continues to be awesome.**iPhone 6**The iPhone 6 (and 6+ I suppose) cameras are excellent. They are incredibly fast to launch with quick focuses.     _________________________>**Battery Life****Galaxy S6**It\u2019s been oddly unpredictable. Some days it seems to have quite a long standby time, others it feels pretty warm and drains quickly. It should get you through the day, which appears to be the aim these days.**Galaxy S6 Edge**I\u2019ve not noticed it being any different than the S6.**Google Nexus 6**I\u2019ve not had any issues making it through a full day. **HTC One M9**The M9 seems to have a solid standby time. I expected a little bit more personally. It can speed through the battery when you do something intense. **Moto X 2014**This is indeed a weak point of the X. I get around 3 hours of screen on time and the phone usually lasts me until about midnight or so. This is with Bluetooth on and an Android Wear device attached 24\/7.**iPhone 6**Standby time is totally ridiculous. It\u2019s almost like it doesn\u2019t drain at all unless you\u2019re using it. I\u2019ve never really had any complaints about iPhone battery life.     _________________________>**Performance****Galaxy S6**Most of the time things are great. There are some weird lags and hiccups, but they\u2019re far less prevalent than on previous Samsung devices. I\u2019m tired of Lollipop\u2019s memory management making a 3GB device feel like it\u2019s got about 256MB at most. **Galaxy S6 Edge**Identical to the S6.**Google Nexus 6**Ever since 5.1 the Nexus 6 flies. Having all cores do all the work really does make a huge difference. Switching between apps is smooth and quick. **HTC One M9**Sense continues to impress me with it\u2019s speed and stability. The 810 obviously has some issues, but they don\u2019t manifest too often. Most of the time the M9 flies along doing whatever task you ask of it. For all the crap written about the M9, I expected really bad things. The M9 just goes to show me again that I do not care at all about benchmarks. **Moto X 2014**My Moto X is currently running the 5.1 soak test. 5.1 on the Moto X is a lot like 5.1 on the Nexus 6: It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s really really fast. Honestly, 5.1 made both Motorola devices pretty hard to beat in the fluidity and speed department. **iPhone 6**Tight hardware and polished iOS make for a very smooth experience. It\u2019s not apples to apples with the other devices here, but you won\u2019t be cursing lag with a new iPhone.    _________________________>**UI & Software****Galaxy S6**I have the T-mobile version. The experience is better than it has been on prior Samsung devices. I personally still don't\u2019 really like it. TouchWiz is still pretty unpleasant to my sensibilities, but it\u2019s not as offensive as it used to be. I will give huge credit to the quick launching of the Camera. **Galaxy S6 Edge**Everything mentioned on the T-mobile version holds true. Also, AT&T (and Samsung) make this device legitimately frustrating. I have pages of disabled bloat. I also have a terrible AT&T notification in the top left. [This is just gross](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9miZw).**Google Nexus 6**This still remains the only real way to get pure Android. It\u2019s far more enjoyable for me than skins still. Google needs to work on their Cameras and sort out these Lollipop memory leaks however. **HTC One M9**Sense continues to be quite fast and slimmed down. The latest version of Sense adds a capable theme store that actually has some quality work in it. I wouldn\u2019t call Sense 7 \u201cmaterial design,\u201d but neither would I call it ugly. BlinkFeed is useful, albeit not  unique. **Moto X 2014**This is my favorite software experience of the bunch. Motorola\u2019s latest could be described as \u201cNexus Plus.\u201d Every feature Motorola adds is well thought out and genuinely useful. Active display is a game changer that you won\u2019t want to be without in the future. Moto Voice is also a nice addition. I\u2019m  huge fan of the camera launch gesture (twist) and now the flashlight gesture.**iPhone 6**It\u2019s iOS, which means on this subreddit it\u2019s the odd man out. I don\u2019t mind iOS, and it\u2019s more polished and \u201copen\u201d than ever. I still prefer Android, but I could definitely get by on iOS.     _________________________>**Other Features and Thoughts****Galaxy S6**The heart rate monitor has proved to be a pretty nifty addition. I can\u2019t really speak to it\u2019s accuracy, but it is precise. The home button and finger print reader have been working incredibly well for me so far. Additionally, I've always *loved* the vibration motors Samsung uses. They\u2019re linear and not rotary so it\u2019s always had a more crisp\/quiet feel than other devices.**Galaxy S6 Edge**All the extra (in comparison with the regular S6) aren't worth the price of admission. **Google Nexus 6**The Nexus 6 is sort of defined by it\u2019s *lack* of \u201cextra features.***HTC One M9**HTC\u2019s Uh-Oh protection is a very cool idea. I love the idea of a rebate if you wind up not needing it. Additionally, HTC SELLS THE PHONE DIRECT TO ME. The fact that I don\u2019t have to have any involvement with a Carrier makes buying one of these all the more pleasant. Also, the M9\u2019s vibration motor is loud. It\u2019s really really loud, and harsh. **Moto X 2014**Motomaker remains incredibly cool. The Moto Hint is a great companion and works really well with Motorola\u2019s voice offerings. **iPhone 6**TouchID is brilliant.     _________________________>**Overall****Galaxy S6**Samsung has finally made a phone that I don\u2019t dislike using. The S6 is so well put together, and feels incredibly solid. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s great looking, as it looks like most other Samsungs. It\u2019s *definitely* not yet another Samsung though. It bears repeating that this phone\u2019s display is hands down the nicest I\u2019ve ever used.**Galaxy S6 Edge**Of Samsung\u2019s 2 new phones, this is the one that has some character and unique looks. It\u2019s a bold, strange, and doesn\u2019t really have a purpose. It is, however, sexy. Not one of the Edge \u201cfeatures\u201d is worthwhile in my opinion. **Google Nexus 6**I love this big, beautiful slab of a phone. It doesnt\u2019 *quite* feel like it was intended from the start as a Nexus, but it works. **HTC One M9**I\u2019ll be honest, I feel bad for HTC this time around. There are so many great things about the overall package on an HTC device. They definitely made some mistakes that will surely hurt their sales this year, but I really appreciate some things they do. I love: Uh-Oh protection, the ability to buy a god damn device from them instead of a carrier, their software vs Touchwiz, and the feel of the device. I hope that the M10 can tie all that together with a better chipset and (PLEASE GOD) camera.**Moto X 2014**In terms of the overall experience delivered, this is my favorite Android device ever. Somewhere in a parallel universe the 2014 X comes with the latest Samsung display and Camera and no one buys anything else. The X is fast, clean, well put together, customizable, and just well thought out in so many ways.**iPhone 6**It\u2019s a great phone. I\u2019ve never denied Apple\u2019s ability to make a really solid device. It has a great camera, a terrific App Store, and top-notch build quality.     _________________________[AT&T Can get bent.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9miZw)[Display comparison between the M9 and the S6](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w0aIW)[Display comparison between the S6 and the S6 Edge](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/KCryk)I hope all that helped or at least entertained some people. Feel free to ask any questions or rage at me or anything else.[Bonus Dog Pictures taken with the S6](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9iOWE)EDIT: Here's the post from the last time I did this: http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/2ec44v\/my_opinions_after_owning_almost_all_major\/","575":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out.

[**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddTdXkAAzFpl?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbddUJWYAMIGYK?format=jpg&name=large).51. [**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","577":"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted. Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package\\_name>.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device \/ OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/galaxy-note-10\/how-to\/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))2. **Privacy:**    1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.samruston.permission&hl=en_IN)    2. More privacy options can be found in settings \/ app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.tempmail&hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video \/ Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https:\/\/blokada.org\/index.html) **\/** [**DNS66**](https:\/\/f-droid.org\/en\/packages\/org.jak_linux.dns66\/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md](https:\/\/github.com\/M66B\/NetGuard\/blob\/master\/ADBLOCKING.md))   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https:\/\/dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)4. **Performance and battery:**   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines \/ Tasker can be used to enhance battery life \/ performance, like      1. Turn off Mobile Data \/ Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.   6. Prefer Dark \/ Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.5. **Other tips:**   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https:\/\/vanced.app\/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings->App->Default Apps.   6. Using [**Your phone**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_IN) for more.    8. [**Hermit**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.   9. [**Firefox Send**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&hl=en_IN) can be used to send files < 2GB to anyone through a link.   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.Edit 1 : Added Google camera and snapdrop.","578":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","579":"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r\/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I\u2019m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience. [Here is a link to the old post, in case you\u2019re interested.](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1w3woc\/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and\/) ##There are two ways of approaching this post:1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you\u2019ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills. **What is Java?** Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable.  **Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language** This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:     String name = \"Dennis\";     String surname = \"Cometti\";     String FullName = name + \" \" + surname;  After this runs, the variable FullName will equal \u201cDennis Cometti\u201d.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0). I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a \u2018Quote\u2019 Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person. **A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English** All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:     String name = \"DENNIS\";     name = name.toLowerCase();  It couldn\u2019t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted \u201cDENNIS\u201d (\"dennis\") to the 'name' variable.After you have typed \u2018name.\u2019 Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance. **Classes, methods and objects in Java** \u2022     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain \u201cDennis\u201d and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89. \u2022     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView. \u2022     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car. \u2022     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects. **So what is the difference between classes and objects?** A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car). A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).An object would be a \u2018name\u2019 (containing the String \u201cDennis\u201d). If you are confused, don\u2019t worry, once you have followed the instructions you\u2019ll understand it much clearer. **Some Java related resources** - [The basics of Java](http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)- [The syntax of Java](http:\/\/www.tutorialspoint.com\/java\/java_basic_syntax.htm)  ##How do you get started making an app?  **Get Android Studio**Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don\u2019t let the words confuse you \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You\u2019ll come across many things you don\u2019t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn\u2019t need them for this exercise). #Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don\u2019t open it yet.]( https:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html) **Strings in Android**Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.[Here\u2019s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http:\/\/developer.android.com\/guide\/topics\/resources\/string-resource.html) **How Android Studio works**Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won\u2019t be using many. When you create a new \u2018Project\u2019 (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.[This screenshot shows what it generates](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HOX9B7S.png)This looks quite complex but it\u2019s actually quite simple. For example the \u2018layout\u2019 folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you\u2019ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.     #####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.> #Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button. #Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/o7NdR) #Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http:\/\/imgur.com\/JM4BIMV.png) #Instruction #6:The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/pRisAsPFThis has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from \u201cTap the screen to begin\u201d to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color. #Instruction #7:Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3I7v9You\u2019ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.You will see \u2018public class Quote{}\u2019, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/VhHbWwSN Just click OK to any popup boxes.What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you \u2018instantiate\u2019 the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon. #Instruction #8:Click on the Quotebook class here: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bG2d0VD.pngThen copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/wz8gbWWAYou\u2019ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable\/line: int count = 0;This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/3FXi14XZ     #Explanation time!     setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);     RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);  The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.____________________     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();      Quote quote1 = new Quote(\"You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck.\", \"Troy Barnes\");     quoteList.add(quote1);      Quote quote2 = new Quote(\"Cool Beans\", \"Rod Kimble\");     quoteList.add(quote2);  The first line here creates an Array\/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called \u2018quoteList\u2019. The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person\u2019s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.____________________This is where it gets a little tricky:     touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {            @Override            public void onClick(View view) {                 if (count < quoteList.size()) {                    Quote q = quoteList.get(count);                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());                    count = count + 1;                 } else{                     count = 0;            }}});  This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.   #Instruction #9:Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018values-v21\u2019, they should both contain a file called styles.xmlIn the \u2018values\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar\" In the \u2018values-v21\u2019 folder, change the parent= value to be:    parent=\"android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar\" This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes. #Instruction #10:To do this next step, you have to:- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed. - [Enable Developer Settings](http:\/\/www.greenbot.com\/article\/2457986\/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging. - Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio\/ADB) Then, you have to click the [green play button](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app! If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers\/android studio. #Instruction #11:Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines. Change the font, colours, formatting or use.Share your own versions in the comments! #If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development. **Libraries** Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.

I have not bought 10 faulty devices in a row - I just like to give critical, honest reviews for people who care about details. And man, this one's a doozy.I moved from a Pixel 6 to an Exynos S22 last week because I wanted a smaller 'flagship' phone. It seems the battery life and performance are the worst I've experienced since the OG Motorola Droid. Chris from Tech Tablets is not exagerating when he says it is [such a laggy mess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/tntlmi\/dont_buy_the_samsung_galaxy_s22_ultra_its_a_mess\/) that it shouldn't be bought. It sounds like clickbait, but I just wanted to corroborate that he is correct - despite all of the good features, the battery and performance overshadow them all.For reference, I have my screen on a very low brightness (but still at 120hz as I can't go back to 60).  I set the processor to 'optimised' mode, but it hasn't made any difference. I don't allow most apps to run in the background, and I don't play games or do anything intensive, and I use WiFi all day rather than data. Basically, what I'm describing below is 'best case scenario', which is worrying.&#x200B;**Battery Life**According to 'device health', I'm using around 150% of the battery each day on average. Mostly, I'm having to charge by mid-afternoon.Today I was busy, so barely used the handset at all. I wanted to see how far it'd go on a single charge. It was in the 'red' after [11h39 minutes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gkHaxk0.jpg), of which 2h12 minutes was 'screen on' time, and maybe 10 minutes of listening to music (that's already cached offline).I don't game or do anything intensive: the main battery usage was by Google Play services, followed by the launcher, and then the always-on-display. Basically, all the things that just run in the background that usually don't rank in battery usage on other devices. The device optimization tool is reporting that no apps are using unusual battery.This means if I take my phone off charge to walk the dog at 7, it'll be dead before I get home for work even if I barely use it. I'm not a heavy user, and even for me this is deal-breaking. It is simply unable to make it through a working day, even if you limit your screen-on-time. I haven't had a handset like that for a very, very long time.In comparison, my Pixel 5 and Pixel 6 would make it through the day and through to the next morning with 4+ hours screen-on-time. The difference is astounding.&#x200B;**Performance**Awful. The screen is 120hz, but it's immediately obvious that it's dropping frames during animations and just generally struggling to keep up. It feels unpleasant to use.It is most noticeable with the 'home' gesture, which gives the haptic feedback about half a second after completing the gesture. I'm not sure if this is actually lag or just part of how Samsung gestures work, but it feels awful, like the interface is constantly behind the user. Home\/multitasking animations frequently stutter, the transition from AOD to home screen lags, and pulling down the notification tray often runs at below 30fps. It's very jarring with the screen going from jerky to smooth constantly.However, after 5 minutes of mild use (browsing Reddit, emails, or web) and the device will become *very* warm in the upper-left corner and it throttles *hard*. The phone becomes incredibly laggy and jittery. Like, you'll do a gesture and nothing happens, so you assume it hasn't registered. So you go to do the gesture again a second later and suddenly the first gesture happens under your thumb and you end up clicking the wrong thing. It feels like a website in the early 2000's where you end up accidentally clicking on popups.Again, I haven't really seen 'lag' in an Android phone since the Motorla Milestone. You wouldn't believe this is intended to compete with the Pixel 6 and iPhone - they feel generations apart. In fact, compared it to our 3 year old, \u00a3150 Xiaomi A2 in a blind test, you'd assume the A2 was the more recent device.I had a OnePlus One way back when, which was widely know for throttling. Well that ain't got shit on the S22. This is next level jank.&#x200B;**Summary**I cannot understand how this made it out of QA? I'm 100% convinced that last year's A series will beat this in framerate \/ responsiveness tests whilst using less battery. How have Samsung released a flagship that performs worse than their entry-leve devices?","581":" Hey \/r\/android!    We all praise the efforts from OEMs to keep our phones with the latest software. We love the updates for the new functionalities, increased stability or even for the sake of having a higher number buried on \"about the phone\" section. However it all goes to waste when companies, in this case, oneplus, break and\/or limit functionalities which were working good, with a new update iteration.    In this particular case, when the nougat update first started to roll out, people noted strange behaviors when using third party cameras (the ones that rely on camera2 API). Under some situations, the phones would hang for a long long time, crash, and display strange artifacts on the viewfinder. As it impacted heavily the phone camera usage, these issues were massively reported on oneplus forums, twitter and xda. (even by the creator of the known OpenCamera). Despite that, they got ignored, report after report, and still, to this day, almost a year later, there wasn't any official position on the issue      On the other hand, using the stock camera app won't reveal any issues. Why? Because it's using a modded legacy API (with HAL3 for the front camera according to sultanxda) to make it work. (The fact that an OEM is still using this method in 2017\/18 would deserve its own discussion, but I will leave as it is, since it's not particularly relevant for this topic). But, as you may ask, if the stock camera works seamlessly, why do we need to rely on 3rd party ones?    Several reasons tbh:    - Useless panorama mode  - **Lack of more advanced controls like intervalometer, exposure metering mode**  - **Lack of manual video settings**  - Low quality 1080p time lapse mode  - No sound with slow motion  - (you tell me) \/s    For those who might have interest on the topic, I'll shed this additional information.    - The camera will always crash during when pointed to bright scenes under some combinations of ISO and shutter speed.    - The exif data (ISO and shutter speed) is incorrectly reported on dark scenes    - Using full auto will allow higher than 799 ISO to be picked by the camera (despite the live stats of the app only read as 799). As soon as you force a manual control, the usable ISO range will be 100-799. Any higher than that and it is the same as 799.    These itself result on a partially useless camera2 API implementation which, if it wasn't enough already, make the phone unstable for every user. All it takes is a camera app download from the play store.      Detailed reports can be found [HERE (XDA)](https:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/oneplus-3t\/how-to\/camera2-bugs-t3569283) [HERE (ONEPLUS)](https:\/\/forums.oneplus.net\/threads\/camera2-api-bugs-for-3rd-party-camera-apps.506100\/) and [HERE (oneplus)](https:\/\/forums.oneplus.net\/threads\/camera-api-2-iso-settings-restricted.569762\/)      **Side note:** currently Google camera port is not 100% stable on our device for the same freaking reason, as it relies solely on camera API.    -      I don't like to free bash on companies, but this behavior is just unacceptable.   Can't just understand how can oneplus have a device unstable for a year without the intention to fix that. I'm really trying to bring attention to this as it is not a minor bug at all.    If this post leads to nowhere, at least I'm trying to inform people of the oneplus *modus operandi*. I still think their hardware is awesome (including my OP3T) but these decisions and the lacking support push me away from a future buy.  Never settle you say?      -        **TL;DR: Oneplus broke the camera2api since nougat update. Refuses to fix it, there are no official answers, despite it being reported countless times. All OP3(T) on nougat or oreo are not stable. Will face reboots and crashes under some usage patterns due to this problem**  **EDIT:**Thanks for the support guys!I've uploaded two videos showing the bug to make our message more clear.[Max\/Reported ISO bug](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWPgj82vIqM)[Phone Crashing and turning unresponsive](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NWA5Sws8rQA)I believe that we, android users, should have to option to choose. It's even more valid if we consider that our phone was marketed for, not only obviously, enthusiasts. That's why we fight to have the api working again. There are people who will find use in being able to shoot 500 30 secs 3200 ISO RAW photos 10 seconds to each other. Other will find the ability to shoot log video at a fixed 1\/48 exposure @24p to post produce later on computer. Other will just download GCAM mod and find that actually we can get some flagship level shots from this phone. That's all about what an open and enthusiast phone should be. I simply refuse to accept the situation which looks like a half made job. It's even worse when your new product suffers from similar issues. Oneplus has the funds and dimension to correct address this problem. There's no way a phone with a 440\u20ac price tag can be unstable when using any legit camera app, from the playstore itself, as long as it uses the HAL3.**EDIT2:** There's a petition up and running that Agent 8923 linked @ comments section[LINK](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/oneplus-oneplus-stop-ignoring-customers-and-fix-the-oneplus-3t-camera)**EDIT3:** Got a reddit PM from oneplus support. I know it does not mean much as lots of us reported the problem via submission forms and oneplus forums. I've told @oneplus via twitter about the problem 3 times only to be asked to use the bug submition form, which has resulted in nothing. I'm gathering all the info I can (logcats, dumps, crashing patterns, video proof, etc) to send them ASAP (and again lol). I will keep you updated later if it leads to somewhere ","582":"After 7 years with an iPhone, I finally took the plunge to see what I might be missing with Android. I love iOS but the Apple conference for the iPhone 7 didn\u2019t really inspire me to upgrade yet again.So, although my wife, kids and parents are still on iOS and I\u2019ve had over 1200 apps come and go through my phone over the years, I decided I wanted to start afresh.This Reddit thread really helped me with some decision making, and continues to help me learn about new apps, and tips and tricks for ones I have. So here I am, returning the favour, for any other iPhone users who are looking at this thread thinking that they might also want to jump ship.#Out of the BoxSwitching on my shiny new Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S7 - but this article should apply to any Android device running Marshmallow or Nougat) for the first time, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect after 7 years of Apple logos and forced stock apps\u2026After being greeted by a dull opening screen, and the option to plug my Google credentials in, I was left staring at my empty home screen, a Google search bar, a large clock and a weather widget. Almost everything else was hidden in the app drawer. It felt like like a place to hide bloatware - but there wasn\u2019t too much guff in there - although I wasn\u2019t about to start using ugly looking Samsung apps when there was a whole app store waiting to be clicked on.Luckily I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s services for years (I\u2019ve never liked iCloud), so my contacts, email, calendars and photos were synced, and my credit card was already hooked up. A quick setting change to get my fingerprint into the phone, and I would be ready to start my journey. So how did day one compare to my old iPhone? Starting up an iPhone for the first time is a much slicker experience - it feels more welcoming (much in the same way a Mac \u2018feels\u2019 more friendly than a PC) and there was a familiar collection of icons. These days though, those most of those Apple apps feel like crapware, and I rarely use Apple\u2019s stock apps. In fact my iPhone was gradually becoming a Google phone anyway (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, etc).So what else was different...#More ButtonsWith the single \u2018home\u2019 button on the iPhone (not counting the volume, power or mute switch), there isn\u2019t much to think about (double tap for app-switcher, hold for Siri). Suddenly there are 3 buttons, and muscle memory made it hard to not keep launching the camera when switching apps (ok - this is a Samsung feature - double tap home to launch camera - it\u2019s really useful). However, having a dedicated \u2018back\u2019 button has proved really useful - the \u2018slide from the left to go back\u2019 that Apple has pushed as the standard for \u2018back\u2019, didn\u2019t work with every app, and if you were thrown from one app to another, you had to stretch your fingers to the very top left of the phone to jump back (Note: the Android \u2018back\u2019 button has occasionally confused me, and thrown me out of apps). Switching between apps on Android is also simple (I\u2019m looking forward to Android 7.0 where I can quickly double tap to jump between the previous\/current app). Having a few extra options for navigating around the phone is really quite good.#Voice - Siri vs OK GoogleI quite liked Siri - she didn\u2019t do much, but she was quite funny.However OK-Google is utterly amazing. From being able to ask a song to be played on Spotify (which will likely never be an option on the iPhone), to dictating a reminder, rarely does Google get the speech-to-text wrong (Siri always seemed to write things on a word-by-word basis, but Google seems to look at the whole sentence and change things accordingly). I\u2019m really impressed, and actually use the voice feature now that I feel it is going to be correct more often than not.The other advantage with the dictation on Android is the ability to click a word and be given the options of other words that you \u2018might\u2019 have said - this makes text editing super quick, without feeling like you need to delete stuff and start again.#LEDsLittle flashing lights on my phone. It\u2019s quite handy seeing it blink away at me, without the whole phone springing to life and lighting up the place.#App EquivalentsThis was the biggest hurdle for me. I\u2019ve gone through a LOT of apps over the years (1256 according to my AppShopper account). Some have stayed on the phone for one launch, others have survived many cullings. But some of my most used and beloved apps just don\u2019t exist on Android. So after much MUCH research and testing, here is my list of equivalent apps (I should add, that it\u2019s really refreshing to be able to select your stock apps on Android): - Mail >> Gmail (or Inbox, Outlooks) - Facetime >> WhatsApp (Video Calling) (or Duo - but sadly I don\u2019t know many people using it - Messages >> Textra  - GBoard >> Google Keyboard (although it doesn\u2019t have Gif search - but it does let you use voice to type) (or Swype, Swiftkey) - Apple Maps >> Google Maps (which is by far superior on Android - with widgets and shortcuts) (or Waze) - Tweetbot >> Talon (or Flamingo, Fenix) - Narwhal (for Reddit) >> Sync (for Reddit) - Notes >> OneNote (or Google Keep, Evernote) - Reminders >>ToDoIst (or Google Reminders, Google Now, Inbox, Keep), Wunderlist)#Apps I Miss##WalletGreat for storing store cards, but most of the individual \u2018store card\u2019 apps seem to have a link to their cards anyway.##MessagesThose blue bubbles! You knew you were sending texts and photos without worrying about how they were going to be seen at the other end. WhatsApp is getting close in terms of features though, and the new video calling feature is great.Erm\u2026 that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve now got apps that shout at me when my battery is charged, or read texts when I\u2019m driving (Shouter Pro), apps that let me jump around to other apps (Swiftly Switch) and folder apps (Sold Explorer File Manager). There are even emulator apps for those old school games.#WidgetsThis leads me onto widgets. On iOS they are tucked into notification style boxes, but (for example) having a ToDoIst task list and my calendar widget on a home screen is much more useful. Throwing in shortcuts to a WhatsApp contact or a favourite Dropbox folder, is great (iOS has 3D touch for some shortcuts, but not all apps work with it). #Apps That iOS Will Never Have##NovaThis is the app that has sold me on Android. I can customise my phone to my heart\u2019s content. I\u2019ve been using similar apps for year - do I really need to have their names written on my phone? Just switch the names off! -  I have a massive screen, so do I really only want a small grid of apps? Just change the amount of apps you want along the horizontal and vertical! You can even resize widgets. - Would I like to position those apps into a more useful layout, change their icons (I\u2019ve even created my own custom designs), change the icon size, change how those icons function if I press or swipe on them? All possible with Nova. - Do I want to double tap the screen to text-message, swipe up to search, pinch to jump to voicemail? Yes\u2026 yes I do.OK, there are a LOT of options and even plugins (for things like adding the red notification dots on apps) - BUT the app is super easy to use, and I can\u2019t imagine using my phone without it (I love to tweak things).##Google NowAlthough there is an iOS version that does some of what \u2018Goolge Now\u2019 does on Android, it really doesn\u2019t work that well. On Android I\u2019m only a swipe away from seeing info about what\u2019s around me, stocks, news, weather, where my car\u2019s parked etc. When I went on holiday, it even pulled in my info about flights, hotels, and train links. ##Google Now On TapHold the home key and you can copy text from anywhere on the screen, or have Google act on what\u2019s on the screen. It feels a little gimmicky, but it can be occasionally useful.#Transferring filesThis almost made me take the phone back. I\u2019m used to just sticking a USB into my iPhone and having my Mac suck the photos from it, sync apps and backup. I\u2019d tried a friends Android and plugged it in, and photos and folders where just as easy to deal with. However, my Galaxy S7 just didn\u2019t want to play. After trying numerous apps and getting nowhere, I ended up using Dropbox to sync my photos in the background (which actually turned out great, as they are constantly backed-up now -see my notes on \u2018Background Multitasking).Then I discovered AirMore (I\u2019m now also trying AirDroid) - a couple of clicks, and I can essentially use my phone through my browser. Texting, screenshots, file transfer, folder search, notifications. It\u2019s slick, fast and allows really easy uploading and downloading of anything I throw at it (for example - Android is sensible enough to stick photos in the Gallery just from a quick drag & drop from the computer browser). #App StoreApple wins here - their AppStore is wonderful. Apps seem to be released first on iOS, and there is a greater proportion of solid, slick looking apps and games (my guess is that piracy rates are high and profits are low on Android). The Google Play Store is getting better though - there have been quite a few slick upgrades in just the last few weeks. One big advantage is being able to buy and install apps from your browser (so if I read a good review on my laptop, I can have the app on my phone in a couple of clicks). Also, if the app is not what you hoped, you can get a refund if you go back to the store quickly enough (2 hours I think). However, there are a LOT of poor apps on the store - for example, there may be dozens of texting apps that can become your stock app, but most look like they were designed by some tin-pot hacker looking to jump into your phone and suck its data dry. #Background multitaskingThe classic battery killer - but I\u2019m not finding any apps that churn away at my battery (I ditched the official Facebook app very early on, and moved to \u2018Swipe Pro\u2019 - another recommendation).There are some big advantages to having things run in the background though - my Dropbox happily uploads photos as soon as I\u2019m on Wifi (Dropbox on iOS would stop as soon as the app was in the background). Apps that I want to sync while I\u2019m not watching them are doing their thing, and the info I want it waiting for me (having apps stop working in the background if I\u2019ve not used them for a few days is great as well - as I have a tendency to get excited by new apps, and then forget to use them).#Fingerprint SensorThe sensor works just as well on my Galaxy S7 as it did on my iPhone (although the iPhone would recognise my print even if the phone was the upside-down, which the S7 doesn\u2019t ) - and more apps are starting to use it (thankfully my banking app does now, so typing in crazy long passwords isn\u2019t such an issue now).Throw in 1Password\u2019s keyboard and it only takes a quick fingerprint unlock to put my password into any app or website.#NotificationsI\u2019ve never really felt happy with iOS notifications - they weren\u2019t easily dismissed, some had more info than others, and once you\u2019d looked at them, they were gone from your screen (until you hunted around for the little red numbered dots all over the place, reminding you of how many things you\u2019ve missed). Android gets it right - a quick swipe down and the notifications are there for you to act on. Swipe them back up to see them later , or swipe them to the side to clear them away. I really don\u2019t miss those red dots nagging at me, and I love the more varied way of being able to interact with notifications (my bank app reminds me I\u2019m signed in, and includes a button to sign-out right in the notification bar, Spotify is there with what is playing, or reminders can be snoozed for later). You can also set whether you want the notification to show just the app name, or more info, on an app-by-app basis.#Anything Else?##ProsI stuck in a 128Gb memory card - so offline music and photos are never an issue anymore.##ConsSlow updating to the lastest Android OS - it looks like I\u2019m going to have to wait a few more months until Nougat hits my phone. But if you are going to get a Google Pixel, this won\u2019t be a problem.#ConclusionOn the whole, there isn\u2019t really all that much different about my day-to-day using of Android vs iOS. I still use a Mac and an iPad, and everything plays nicely together. But I do love the shortcuts, customisation of look and feel, and all the tweaking of gestures (via Nova). It feels like *MY* phone, instead of looking like everyone else\u2019s, and has become a good new friend in my pocket.Would I recommend Android? Well\u2026 I still think an average user would get along better with an iPhone - the whole package just works; they back themselves up and never really change much.However, I love to play with my gadgets and iOS was just starting to bore me. It was a really hard decision to jump platforms, but I\u2019m really pleased I did. I feel equally at home on either platform, but I\u2019m really happy to be on Android.Edit: formatting listsEdit 2:Wow. That's a lot of comments so far - and virtually all of them are helpful or inquisitive. I love this subreddit! **What I should add to my review based on feedback:** - Everyone should get Tasker.  - Two apps can be opened at once (a GS7 feature on Android 6, but open to all on Android 7). - No Android Pay in Canada. - No working version of Samsung Pay in Canada. - People really love a lot of different Reddit apps! - This review was really about the OS - there are too many phones and features - love the phone you have. - I've tried every tip to get my phone to be seen by my Mac, and  only Android Transfer worked (but it's a bit underwhelming). However, AirMore and AirDroid still seem like the best options for me (looking into 'Join' and 'PushBullet' though). 'Commander One' for Mac looks interesting too. - Set up a Nova gesture to easily get to Google Now (mine is now swipe up from app drawer) - Saying \"OK Google - Lumos\" and \"OK Google - Nox\" was the funniest tip I received (thanks \/user\/0x6A7232)!Edit 3 & 4: formatting lists (as Markdown suddenly doesn't seem to be working for me!)Edit 5: I've got a screenshot of my new homescreen with apps based on everyones feedback.

What you also might've heard is that it now relies on permission [categories](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f17qe9vZ8RM&t=150) instead of the more specific permission model that was used in the past.Alongside this change, apps will be [given more permissions by default](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/preview\/features\/runtime-permissions.html), even without accepting any permission categories on Android M. One of the permissions that currently [appears to be granted](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/frameworks\/base\/+\/android-m-preview\/core\/res\/AndroidManifest.xml) by default in Android M is GET_ACCOUNTS, which grants [access to your e-mail address](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/2175688) for Google accounts, and even if Google changes this, might still grant access to e-mail addresses belonging to other account types and services. (Thanks to [christop](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=9621627) for mentioning this permission.)**My request to Google:** please don't grant this permission unless the user approves the Contacts category. Please ensure that merely installing the wrong flashlight app, live wallpaper or what-have-you cannot allow my e-mail address to be sent to an organization I've never heard of that is registered in the Seychelles. (Don't forget - full network access comes with all apps in Android M!)---*Quit reading here if you're not interested in other issues and vulnerabilities the new model in Android M could cause.*Aside from e-mail addresses, there are some other permissions I think might be troublesome to automatically grant to apps, and I'm not completely sure yet I've found all of them. I'd like to kindly ask anyone who can to thoroughly review those permissions to ensure that they don't end up as the technical debt that future API levels need to try to fix again, after causing users pain in the mean time.* READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE isn't used much by the Nexus range, but for many other devices this permission is highly sensitive, containing full device backups, contact backups, and highly sensitive downloads outside of app-specific directories. It was not shown to be one of the new permission categories. How does Android M deal with it? Might it be time to switch away from FAT32 to ext4 to allow for permissions to apply to it?* CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE is automatically granted and can allow apps to turn on mobile data (and WiFi). This can cost money to the millions of users who have exceeded their data plans or who are on prepaid plans. Suggested fix: a System Settings permission category.* READ_PHONE_STATE is part of the Phone category, but used to be requested by developers frequently to detect *whether* there was an incoming call so that app audio could be muted. Please ensure that apps cannot get phone numbers without the Phone category, but that apps can still gracefully deal with incoming calls.* GET_TASKS  is granted by default but was being deprecated. Please disable it in API23 so that apps cannot peek into the thumbnails of other apps. Information shown to the user may be sensitive and must not be seen by other apps.* SET_WALLPAPER (and its hints) are granted by default and seem like low-impact permissions, but I'm sure that was initially thought of allowing apps to show notifications as well, until push ads came along. Now that the user can disable notifications for specific apps, apps may be inclined to show ads on the wallpaper instead if they're given this permission for free anyway (including ones prompting for virus scans and nonsense like that). I suggest adding this to a new System Settings permission category.* WRITE_SETTINGS is granted by default, while it used to be treated as quite sensitive. A System Settings category would fix this.* SET_TIME_ZONE is granted by default, but should also require System Settings.* MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is granted by default but allowed for redirecting audio streams, and should require the Microphone permission category. If this is now split off to MODIFY_AUDIO_ROUTING, consider making that a part of the System Settings category as well, instead of making this functionality impossible for future devices.* READ_SYNC_SETTINGS, WRITE_SYNC_SETTINGS could conceivably leak private details depending on the identity information associated with it. Might make more sense in a System Settings category.* App names\/icons displayed in the permission prompts should match the Play Store name and icon, otherwise apps may be inclined to request permissions as \"Android System\" or something equally serious.* Contacts is a highly sensitive permission category, especially in conjunction with full network access. In some jurisdictions providing users' personal details such as phone numbers to third parties may even be illegal without the permissions of those contacts, and I think it's frowned upon by many regardless. There should be a way for apps to opt-out of all communication subsystems so that they can be allowed access to sensitive data such as contacts, special files, confidential recordings, etc. \"**Offline apps**\" if you will, which could be a simple label given automatically to all apps that do not request network permissions such as INTERNET, BLUETOOTH etc. This could be the only category whose auto-updates would need to be limited to updates that are also Offline apps. A lack of this feature will pose problems for devices used in high-security environments and could give Android a bad name in the enterprise environment, as nothing could ever be guaranteed to remain private.If you have any thought on permissions that are inappropriate to grant automatically, please leave a comment. **Did I get something wrong? I'm sorry** - the available information is preliminary and still quite dispersed - again, please leave a comment.","584":"**TL;DR:** NFC Smart Unlock has been removed for all newly signed in Google Accounts on Android.

Details in [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/72tj6u\/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock\/dsq851j\/).&nbsp;**Update - 29 Sep:** Looks like Google have finally removed NFC Smart Unlock from the Online [Nexus](https:\/\/support.google.com\/nexus\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) and [Pixel](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) support pages.

There still does not appear to be a reason or explanation for the removal.&nbsp;**Update - 30 Sep:** After a few days of complaints, comments and theories Google have finally given an Official explanation as to why NFC Smart Lock has been disabled for new Android logins and devices. The explanation can be found on the [issue tracker thread](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/65425413#comment24) and in my [reddit comment below](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/72tj6u\/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock\/dnpi5ny\/). &nbsp;**Quote TL;DR:** Constantly evaluate unlock mechanisms, extremely low usage, alternatives available that are easy to use, secure and have much wider adoption.A disussion about the statement can be found in [this reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/73ejrk\/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives).&nbsp;**Non-TL;DR:**A Google employee recently responded on a [bug report](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/65425413) in the [Google Issue Tracker](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com) that quote, > \"SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users.

Feel free to \"Star\" ~~and Comment on~~ the relevant issue tracker [threads](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/65425413) etc. I know that many people rely heavily on NFC Smart Unlock and use it on a daily basis. Those users are entitled to the features that they have paid for.As the issue tracker site is not publicly viewable hopefully this thread serves as a legitimate resource for people to refer to, hence the long post here.&nbsp;**FAQ**&nbsp;**What is NFC Smart Unlock?**NFC Smart Unlock allows a user to unlock their Near Field Communication Enabled Android phone using a physical token or card. Many companies sell NFC Rings or Wristbands specifically to be used for Device unlocking and authentication. NFC Smart Unlock allows an NFC Tag or accessory to act like a Physical key to access a device. This type of authentication technology is also very common in the enterprise as well as with Hotels and Apartment Building complexes.&nbsp;**What Devices or Android Versions are affected?**All Versions of Android with Smart Unlock are affected (5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0). The NFC Smart Unlock feature is remotely enabled\/disabled by Google. Internet Access is necessary to activate All Smart Unlock Features (Voice, Face, Bluetooth etc). Contrary to popular belief the Version of Google Play Services Installed Does Not affect the availability of the feature. There has been a recent increase in the number of people reporting this issue due to users installing updates and upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo. As more users upgrade their devices in the months to come more people are likely to lose this access to this feature.&nbsp;**My Device still has NFC Smart Unlock are you sure it's just not a Bug?**This issue currently affects All NEW Android Device Logins. If you setup your device or signed into your Google Account in June 2017 or earlier then you should not be affected. If you perform a device factory reset or flash a new ROM Image then NFC Smart Unlock will not be available to you anymore. Currently there is no know 'fix' as this feature has been *\"deprecated\"* by Google.&nbsp;**Why has this happened?**30-Sep-17 - Google have provided an official statement regarding the removal, that statement and more information can be found in [this reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/73ejrk\/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives). Currently (27-Sep-17) Google have not officially provided a reason for the removal of the NFC Smart Unlock Feature. The feature was disabled very quietly and without a warning or notice to users. NFC Smart Unlock is still listed as a feature on Google's [Pixel](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) and [Nexus](https:\/\/support.google.com\/nexus\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) Online Help Documentation as of Sep 27. It is also listed in the Device Manual for New Android 8.0 Devices such as the [Xperia XZ1](https:\/\/support.sonymobile.com\/global-en\/xperiaxz1\/userguide\/unlocking-your-device-automatically\/). My best guess would be it is some sort of Legal or Patent issue but as this feature has been available for a few years it does seem strange.&nbsp;**Are there any alternative options or workarounds?**As far as I know there are some options using third party apps but there isn't currently any known work around to re-enable the Google NFC Unlock Feature. Regardless users shouldn't have to use a third party app to gain back functionality they already had access to. Not to mention the potentially major security and privacy issues that come with using a third party app.&nbsp;**Why Does this Matter?**Google has removed an important device feature silently without notice or warning to customers. This speaks volumes about how Google treats its customers. This also serves as a general warning to be mindful of this sort behaviour from Google. As Android Users we have a right to the features we paid for on the hardware we paid for. And if those software features need to be removed for some reason legal or otherwise then we deserve a warning beforehand and a reason saying exactly what is happening, why it is happening and what alternative options or potential resolutions there may be.&nbsp;**Background Information\/Testing\/Proof** If you want my detailed testing and breakdown information then check post #4 on the [Issue Tracker thread](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/65425413).&nbsp;**Opinion**It would perhaps be more reasonable if this feature was removed for only new Google Accounts and all existing Android users got grandfathered in but this hasn't happened. I do find the wording on the issue tracker to be very questionable. > \"SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden.\" I am not a \"new user\" I have been using Android since 2012 and have had a Google Account for nearly 10 years, I'm hardly a \"new user\". Even if you use the *new* device approach, I had the feature when I setup my device in June but now I do not, how am I not an \"existing NFC user\". I suspect Google plan for this to be at least a somewhat permanent change and if that ends up being the case it will really impact the companies and brands that make and sell NFC rings, wristbands and key-fobs etc. This move basically destroys a significant chunk of their business. Not to mention the investment from users in NFC Tags, Fobs and in some cases bio-implants. Fortunately for me I've only bought Stickers.&nbsp;**Other Relevant NFC Unlock Bug Report Thread**&nbsp;There is also another NFC Smart Unlock Issue Tracker thread where users are complaining that the NFC Unlock Feature doesn't work very reliability on their devices. This thread has also been seen by a Google Employee and they state quote \"We've deferred this [issue?] to a future release, but leaving this open for now.\" Link: https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/62268615&nbsp;","585":"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining\/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r\/samsung](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samsung\/) and [r\/galaxys10](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line \"powered by 360\". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo\\_360](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo_360)).If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998](https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \\[dot\\] cn, wshifen \\[dot\\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv](https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their \"Big Data   platform\", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the \"nothing to hide\" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.","586":"Hi \/r\/Android, if you don't know me, I'm Mishaal Rahman, the guy who wrote that absurdly long [Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/wek1m8\/android_13_changelog_a_deep_dive\/) that was posted to this subreddit recently. I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3. [**Themed Icons**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#themed_icons). The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers). There's a new API to dim the wallpaper, and it's being [used by the Digital Wellbeing app](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FZbdYUSXEAInYoG?format=jpg&name=large) to darken wallpapers at bedtime so bright\/vibrant wallpapers will be less blinding.

[**Bonus: The Easter egg**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Of course, we can't forget this one. There's a new Easter egg in Android 13, because of course there is! Like usual, you access it by tapping repeatedly on the \"Android version\" field in Settings > About phone. When the clock appears, turn it so the hands point at 1:00. Surrounding the Android 13 logo will be a bunch of bubbles. Long press those to make a bunch of emojis appear. Long press again to cycle through the various emoji combinations.Once again, I'd like to stress that this is NOT a comprehensive list of every feature in Android 13. I've intentionally left out things so as to not hit Reddit's character limit for self-posts. If you want a comprehensive list of new features in Android 13, [read my article over at Esper.io](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/), which will continue to be updated in the coming days and weeks.If I got anything wrong when summarizing these features, let me know! Also, if you know of something in Android 13 that I haven't already documented in my deep dive (or that I got wrong in it), feel free to contact me! With how massive each Android OS update is, there's bound to be some things I missed.","587":"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products\/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM\/YTM\/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM\/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from \"YouTube Music\".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship \"killers\", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add \"powered by Android\" on their bootscreens](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2019\/10\/07\/powered-by-android-branding-2020\/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes\/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because \"Android 10.1\" is being released as \"Android 11\". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier\/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is\/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant\/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a \"faceless\" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as \"being used in a way that violates Google's policies\" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has \"done so.\" [Example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/7nrx07\/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because\/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99\/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps\/features\/products\/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE\/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify\/add\/remove system components on devices, and still control\/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very \"self-service\"\/\"you're on your own\". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet \/ hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA\/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is \/r\/Android, and Android is supposed to be a \"platter\" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A\/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.","588":"Please don't tell me I have a 'faulty unit' Every year I review my new phone here, and a barrage of evangelists jump in to tell me mine must be faulty. I have not bought 10 faulty devices in a row - I just like to give critical, honest reviews for people who care about details. And man, this one's a doozy.I moved from a Pixel 6 to an Exynos S22 last week because I wanted a smaller 'flagship' phone. It seems the battery life and performance are the worst I've experienced since the OG Motorola Droid. Chris from Tech Tablets is not exagerating when he says it is [such a laggy mess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/tntlmi\/dont_buy_the_samsung_galaxy_s22_ultra_its_a_mess\/) that it shouldn't be bought. It sounds like clickbait, but I just wanted to corroborate that he is correct - despite all of the good features, the battery and performance overshadow them all.For reference, I have my screen on a very low brightness (but still at 120hz as I can't go back to 60).  I set the processor to 'optimised' mode, but it hasn't made any difference. I don't allow most apps to run in the background, and I don't play games or do anything intensive, and I use WiFi all day rather than data. Basically, what I'm describing below is 'best case scenario', which is worrying.&#x200B;**Battery Life**According to 'device health', I'm using around 150% of the battery each day on average. Mostly, I'm having to charge by mid-afternoon.Today I was busy, so barely used the handset at all. I wanted to see how far it'd go on a single charge. It was in the 'red' after [11h39 minutes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gkHaxk0.jpg), of which 2h12 minutes was 'screen on' time, and maybe 10 minutes of listening to music (that's already cached offline).I don't game or do anything intensive: the main battery usage was by Google Play services, followed by the launcher, and then the always-on-display. Basically, all the things that just run in the background that usually don't rank in battery usage on other devices. The device optimization tool is reporting that no apps are using unusual battery.This means if I take my phone off charge to walk the dog at 7, it'll be dead before I get home for work even if I barely use it. I'm not a heavy user, and even for me this is deal-breaking. It is simply unable to make it through a working day, even if you limit your screen-on-time. I haven't had a handset like that for a very, very long time.In comparison, my Pixel 5 and Pixel 6 would make it through the day and through to the next morning with 4+ hours screen-on-time. The difference is astounding.&#x200B;**Performance**Awful. The screen is 120hz, but it's immediately obvious that it's dropping frames during animations and just generally struggling to keep up. It feels unpleasant to use.It is most noticeable with the 'home' gesture, which gives the haptic feedback about half a second after completing the gesture. I'm not sure if this is actually lag or just part of how Samsung gestures work, but it feels awful, like the interface is constantly behind the user. Home\/multitasking animations frequently stutter, the transition from AOD to home screen lags, and pulling down the notification tray often runs at below 30fps. It's very jarring with the screen going from jerky to smooth constantly.However, after 5 minutes of mild use (browsing Reddit, emails, or web) and the device will become *very* warm in the upper-left corner and it throttles *hard*. The phone becomes incredibly laggy and jittery. Like, you'll do a gesture and nothing happens, so you assume it hasn't registered. So you go to do the gesture again a second later and suddenly the first gesture happens under your thumb and you end up clicking the wrong thing. It feels like a website in the early 2000's where you end up accidentally clicking on popups.Again, I haven't really seen 'lag' in an Android phone since the Motorla Milestone. You wouldn't believe this is intended to compete with the Pixel 6 and iPhone - they feel generations apart. In fact, compared it to our 3 year old, \u00a3150 Xiaomi A2 in a blind test, you'd assume the A2 was the more recent device.I had a OnePlus One way back when, which was widely know for throttling. Well that ain't got shit on the S22. This is next level jank.&#x200B;**Summary**I cannot understand how this made it out of QA? I'm 100% convinced that last year's A series will beat this in framerate \/ responsiveness tests whilst using less battery. How have Samsung released a flagship that performs worse than their entry-leve devices?","589":"**Edit #3: I\u2019ve been contacted by and talked with a class action law firm about my issues with Motorola\/Lenovo. The firm\u2019s name is Girard Gibbs and they are actively investigating this case and would like to hear from others that are experiencing problems with warranty service from Motorola. If you want to contact the firm, send an email to: eyn@girardgibbs.com.**   Very briefly I will relate my interactions with Motorola over the past 2 months and try to keep it from being my personal story.  This is not a thread about one person complaining about the customer service they received.  But the ordeal I am going through with Motorola in order to execute a simple limited-warranty exchange lead me to discover a much bigger issue.Motorola simply can't honor the warranty on their devices because they don't have replacement devices in stock.   I know for a fact that they have had no stock of the Moto G 3rd Gen, The Moto X Pure Edition and the Moto 360 and probably other devices for at least the past two months (I was directly told this by someone of 'Executive' status in the company).  But from all the other complaints I found on Moto forums, reddit and various other sites, it's apparent that this has been an ongoing issue for a while now but has become very problematic since January.  Coincidentally, it was announced in January 2016 that the name \"Motorola\" would no longer be used for the public, i.e. Lenovo is phasing out the brand names Moto and Motorola.I have an in-warranty Moto G 3rd gen that started malfunctioning to the point of it being hit-or-miss if it will work.  Two months ago I was authorized for an Advanced exchange to get the device replaced. [The program says it takes a maximum of 4 business days + shipping time](https:\/\/motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com\/app\/answers\/detail\/a_id\/63591\/~\/advance-exchange-program) for the replacement to arrive.  Weeks passed with no communication from Moto, I had to hound them over and over to find out what the status with my case and was and eventually found out they had no stock of Moto Gs for warranty exchange.  They tried to look for similar devices (The Moto X Pure Edition) and they were out of stock of that too.  And after some searching, the same is true for the Moto 360 as well.  Here are some quotes with their sources:  * https:\/\/www.consumeraffairs.com\/cell_phones\/motorola.html - Read a few, skim the rest but no need to go beyond the first page.  You get the idea pretty quick.  * [I sent in my black, metal band Moto 360 (1st gen) to Motorola over a month ago when it stopped powering on. They received it and I didn't get an update for 1 month so I called them and they said they are out of stock but they could offer me the champagne colored watch - I refused since I would've bought that color originally if it was what I wanted. Anyways, they said to wait 2 days to see if they get more in stock - I waited 11 days (I was very patient) and called today and they said they still don't have any in stock.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/moto360\/comments\/3r76ik\/motorola_not_honoring_warranty_because_they_are\/)  * [Three months after purchase, phone stopped working entirely (no water or physical damage). Sent it in and was promised to receive a new phone within 5 days. 10 days later, I called their support line to ask about the delay. They said it would take another 7-10 business days. Today, after an additional week, I called to inquire, and another rep told me it would arrive in two weeks. Worst service I have ever experienced. This is my third Motorola phone over five years, and after this experience, I will never buy a Motorola product again. Still waiting for my phone. 4\/4\/16](http:\/\/www.customerservicescoreboard.com\/Motorola)  This link has a ton of other people reporting similar issues.  * [Today (4\/11\/2016), I called the RE Team again to get an update, and happened to reach Marlin again. He had nothing to update me with because the status was still the same: there were no replacement phones available at the wharehouse. He apologized several times, and understood why I was upset. Then I asked him if replacement phones haven't been available for a month, and customers are out there waiting for a replacements, why not give them a new phone. **His response was that the team wants to do something like this, but Corporate has told them no discounts of any kind are to be offered and no new phones are to be offered.**](https:\/\/forums.lenovo.com\/t5\/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style\/Moto-X-Pure-Repair-Replacement-Limbo\/td-p\/3305032)  Scroll through the rest of the [Moto X forums](https:\/\/forums.lenovo.com\/t5\/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style\/bd-p\/449) and check out the other device forums as well.  You'll see complaint after complaint of people waiting weeks\/months for Moto to get stock of their particular device to fulfill their warranty exchange.  * [During this entire span of about 1.5 months, I was forced to go buy a temporary phone. Not only that, but Motorola charged me the full price of the replacement since they haven't received the original defective phone. I've spent hours & hours on the phone and via email with support and they've been rude, forgettful and unaccomodating. In fact, this is by far the worst support experience I've had with any company in my lifetime. After looking through Better Business Bureau reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who has gone through this.  Any ideas on ways I can finally resolve this issue? I'm tempted just to bring my lawyer in or submit an inquiry to some consumer watchdog groups.

If you need to use your warranty, be prepared to spend hours on the phone and weeks of waiting.  You can call them and speak to supervisors and get your case escalated but you'll only end up listening to same lines repeated over and over - \"sorry we're still out of stock all we can do is wait for stock then we'll ship your replacement\" (which will be a refurbished phone).   Threatening legal action or contacting consumer advocacy groups seems to occasionally produce results from peoples' testimonials.  That or leveraging social media to your advantage.  BTW I'm not writing this in the hope it will personally help me with my issue.  I'm writing this so Motorola device owner's will know that the 12 month limited warranty that came with their device is virtually meaningless.  And I'm hoping this post gains attention so more people are aware of Motorola's practices.  I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say if their practices and policies are illegal or not, (in my opinion immoral, but that doesn't mean anything) but from the research I did there are state and federal laws designed to protect the consumer and ensure the warranter honors the agreement.  On the Federal level there is the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act](https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law) and the laws will vary state to state.  So hopefully I got my point across.  This isn't a call to action.  This isn't a person complaining about their customer experience.  The primary purpose of this post is to serve as a warning to \/r\/Android (and any other sub I xpost to) of what to expect when dealing with Motorola's warranty service and to facilitate discussion about recent experiences with Motorola's warranty service, even if it's contrary to my experience and all my citations.  Are they intentionally doing this?  Is it just a shortage of inventory due to change in ownership and facilities?  What do people think?And I must confess, I have a secondary purpose for writing this.  it is the small hope that this post will gain attention and affect some type of change. Thanks for reading.Oh and here's the actual warranty:  [Motorola's Moto G 3rd Gen Warranty](https:\/\/motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com\/ci\/fattach\/get\/797995\/1391012650\/redirect\/1\/filename\/Global%20Limited%20Warranty10-3-13-1.pdf)  >  2.

Gotta love that attention to detail in a legally binding document.**Edit #1**: it's interesting how many of you are bringing up Lenovo and their reputation for having terrible customer support, especially when it comes to warranties and repairs. I actually had just as negative of an experience with Lenovo regarding a laptop, and as a result I will never spend another dollar with Lenovo.  The thing I find funny was that I had to send my laptop to Lenovo for repair in Fort Worth Texas. Well guess where Motorola's repair and warranty center is now? Fort Worth Texas. And not to get too personal, the laptop I received back was completely non-functional, as in if you had pressed the power button you would have seen it didn't even turn on.  And in my links above you will see plenty of people complaining about sending their phones to Fort Worth for repairs and getting non-functioning phones back.  I recall one person talking about their Moto G no longer getting a signal, so he sent it there for repairs and when he got it back they had replaced the power button on the phone.Capitalism is like democracy, you vote with your dollar. If you don't like the way a company does business then don't \"vote\" for them.  **Edit #2**: Looks like a news site picked up on this thread.  *  http:\/\/www.phonearena.com\/news\/Customers-report-Motorola-support-doesnt-honor-warranties_id80263  *  http:\/\/www.droid-life.com\/2016\/04\/15\/motorola-warranty-customer-service-disaster\/  *  http:\/\/www.androidheadlines.com\/2016\/04\/reports-motorola-not-honoring-warranties-increase.html    *  http:\/\/pocketnow.com\/2016\/04\/15\/motorola-warranty-service  *  http:\/\/thedroidguy.com\/2016\/04\/motorola-supposedly-denying-several-warranty-claims-1058349  * http:\/\/www.trustedreviews.com\/news\/motorola-warranty-broken-phone-no-more-stockI only hope more do the same!

I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the \"I hate Samsung\" train that is r\/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying \"it's sooo smooth!\"  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious \"Pure Android\" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. A noteworthy experience, but can it last?My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g\u0336i\u0336m\u0336m\u0336i\u0336c\u0336k\u0336 feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. Picasso once said \"Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.\" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but \"THE\" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, \"Smooth now, but give it a month or two...\" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it\u2019s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I\u2019m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don\u2019t kill off the headphone jack. Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased\/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one! EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold!EDIT2: Fixed spelling errors and \"carrier skins\" to \"OEM skins\"  thanks u\/exelero88","591":"I'm a longtime Android user (11 years) who recently switched to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. I did this mainly because I just love tech and trying new things (in 2021 I've used the S21, Z Fold3, and S21 Ultra), but also because my Pixel 6 was annoying me with lots of random bugs lately.While I still think Android is the better OS for me, there are a few things that make me enjoy using the iPhone 13 that I wish Android would copy.# Things I wish Android would Copy from iOS:* **Smoother Animations:**   * So this might not seem like a big deal to some people, but I noticed it immediately. iOS generally feels smoother because of the animations. It's like someone sat down and key-framed every subtle movement. It just feels \"natural\". It was super jarring when I picked up my S21 Ultra to compare. Not saying the S21 Ultra is slow by any means, but the animations just seem...sharp; even after going into the developer options and slowing them down a bit. While the Pixel 6 is a little better, it's still not close to how it feels on iOS.&#x200B;* **Spotlight Search**   * On iOS, a quick swipe down from the home screen will bring up a Spotlight search which will search everything. App Store, the Web, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, Apple Photos, Google Photos, etc. You can sort of do this on Android devices. However, it doesn't bring up the same amount of information as it does on iOS. Also, iOS will give you a nicely formatted quick summary if you search for something like a well-known person or event.&#x200B;* **Widget Stacks**   * iOS has this concept of widget stacks or smart widgets. Basically, a widget can change what it displays based on your daily activities and location context. I've actually found it super helpful. For example, my weather widget will change to the Apple Maps widget when I'm leaving the store and tell me how long it will take to get home. Or switch to the battery widget when my Apple Watch or phone are getting low. Then back to the weather widget when I wake up in the morning.&#x200B;* **Integration between Apps**   * Apple apps integrate really well into other Apple apps. For example, I can set a reminder that will show up when I message someone using iMessage. Apple Notes, Reminders, iMessage, Calendar, and Facetime all work really well with each other. It would be great if Google can do this with their services. They always try then forget that the service exists and makes a new one instead.&#x200B;* **Vibration Haptics**   * This one is dependent on Android manufacturers. But the vibration haptics on the iPhone are very good. It's hard to describe without just feeling it in person.&#x200B;* **Battery Life**   * The iPhone 13 Pro max has given me the best battery life in any phone that I've had, at least since the old Moto Z Play.&#x200B;* **Apple Watch**   * I'm still waiting for Google to release a Pixel watch. I have the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, and compared to the Apple Watch, it needs some more refinement. The Apple Watch has better haptics, doesn't lag, and a better UI IMO.# Things that annoy me about iOS:* **The lack of Notification Channels:**   * I'm so used to Android where we can customize notifications down to the individual channel and mute certain notification channels per app. You can't do that on iOS. You have either two options \"Will this app make a sound\" or will it \"Not make a sound\" I basically have to keep my phone on silent. For example, I can't turn off the \"swoosh\" sound on iMessage that happens whenever I send a message. The only option is to have my phone on silent with the option of \"allow vibrations on silent.\" Likewise, I can't turn off the camera noise on Snapchat unless I have my phone on silent.&#x200B;* **No work mode:**   * Android has a great work mode feature. During work hours, you can have all the designated work apps be active, then \"freeze\" them once it's over. IOS 15 introduced a new focus mode, but it literally works in the opposite way. You have to \"opt-in\" apps that you want available rather an \"opt out\". Completely useless as a work mode replacement.&#x200B;* **You must do things the Apple Way:**   * I think we all know this. But there are lots of UX design choices that seem odd to me. And unfortunately, there just isn't a setting to change them. On Android, (especially Samsung Galaxy phones with GoodLock app), you can change almost anything that you don't like.&#x200B;* **No Universal Back gesture**   * Some apps support it, while others don't.&#x200B;* **No quick actions on notifications:**   * I was disappointed when I found out that I couldn't just tap a \"thumbs up\" button on the YouTube music notification like I do on Android.&#x200B;* **Misc Features:**   * No Scrolling screenshot   * No USB-C   * No Reverse Wireless Charging   * No PIP mode. Really miss this for Maps","592":"After 7 years with an iPhone, I finally took the plunge to see what I might be missing with Android. I love iOS but the Apple conference for the iPhone 7 didn\u2019t really inspire me to upgrade yet again.So, although my wife, kids and parents are still on iOS and I\u2019ve had over 1200 apps come and go through my phone over the years, I decided I wanted to start afresh.This Reddit thread really helped me with some decision making, and continues to help me learn about new apps, and tips and tricks for ones I have. So here I am, returning the favour, for any other iPhone users who are looking at this thread thinking that they might also want to jump ship.#Out of the BoxSwitching on my shiny new Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S7 - but this article should apply to any Android device running Marshmallow or Nougat) for the first time, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect after 7 years of Apple logos and forced stock apps\u2026After being greeted by a dull opening screen, and the option to plug my Google credentials in, I was left staring at my empty home screen, a Google search bar, a large clock and a weather widget. Almost everything else was hidden in the app drawer. It felt like like a place to hide bloatware - but there wasn\u2019t too much guff in there - although I wasn\u2019t about to start using ugly looking Samsung apps when there was a whole app store waiting to be clicked on.Luckily I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s services for years (I\u2019ve never liked iCloud), so my contacts, email, calendars and photos were synced, and my credit card was already hooked up. A quick setting change to get my fingerprint into the phone, and I would be ready to start my journey. So how did day one compare to my old iPhone? Starting up an iPhone for the first time is a much slicker experience - it feels more welcoming (much in the same way a Mac \u2018feels\u2019 more friendly than a PC) and there was a familiar collection of icons. These days though, those most of those Apple apps feel like crapware, and I rarely use Apple\u2019s stock apps. In fact my iPhone was gradually becoming a Google phone anyway (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, etc).So what else was different...#More ButtonsWith the single \u2018home\u2019 button on the iPhone (not counting the volume, power or mute switch), there isn\u2019t much to think about (double tap for app-switcher, hold for Siri). Suddenly there are 3 buttons, and muscle memory made it hard to not keep launching the camera when switching apps (ok - this is a Samsung feature - double tap home to launch camera - it\u2019s really useful). However, having a dedicated \u2018back\u2019 button has proved really useful - the \u2018slide from the left to go back\u2019 that Apple has pushed as the standard for \u2018back\u2019, didn\u2019t work with every app, and if you were thrown from one app to another, you had to stretch your fingers to the very top left of the phone to jump back (Note: the Android \u2018back\u2019 button has occasionally confused me, and thrown me out of apps). Switching between apps on Android is also simple (I\u2019m looking forward to Android 7.0 where I can quickly double tap to jump between the previous\/current app). Having a few extra options for navigating around the phone is really quite good.#Voice - Siri vs OK GoogleI quite liked Siri - she didn\u2019t do much, but she was quite funny.However OK-Google is utterly amazing. From being able to ask a song to be played on Spotify (which will likely never be an option on the iPhone), to dictating a reminder, rarely does Google get the speech-to-text wrong (Siri always seemed to write things on a word-by-word basis, but Google seems to look at the whole sentence and change things accordingly). I\u2019m really impressed, and actually use the voice feature now that I feel it is going to be correct more often than not.The other advantage with the dictation on Android is the ability to click a word and be given the options of other words that you \u2018might\u2019 have said - this makes text editing super quick, without feeling like you need to delete stuff and start again.#LEDsLittle flashing lights on my phone. It\u2019s quite handy seeing it blink away at me, without the whole phone springing to life and lighting up the place.#App EquivalentsThis was the biggest hurdle for me. I\u2019ve gone through a LOT of apps over the years (1256 according to my AppShopper account). Some have stayed on the phone for one launch, others have survived many cullings. But some of my most used and beloved apps just don\u2019t exist on Android. So after much MUCH research and testing, here is my list of equivalent apps (I should add, that it\u2019s really refreshing to be able to select your stock apps on Android): - Mail >> Gmail (or Inbox, Outlooks) - Facetime >> WhatsApp (Video Calling) (or Duo - but sadly I don\u2019t know many people using it - Messages >> Textra  - GBoard >> Google Keyboard (although it doesn\u2019t have Gif search - but it does let you use voice to type) (or Swype, Swiftkey) - Apple Maps >> Google Maps (which is by far superior on Android - with widgets and shortcuts) (or Waze) - Tweetbot >> Talon (or Flamingo, Fenix) - Narwhal (for Reddit) >> Sync (for Reddit) - Notes >> OneNote (or Google Keep, Evernote) - Reminders >>ToDoIst (or Google Reminders, Google Now, Inbox, Keep), Wunderlist)#Apps I Miss##WalletGreat for storing store cards, but most of the individual \u2018store card\u2019 apps seem to have a link to their cards anyway.##MessagesThose blue bubbles! You knew you were sending texts and photos without worrying about how they were going to be seen at the other end. WhatsApp is getting close in terms of features though, and the new video calling feature is great.Erm\u2026 that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve now got apps that shout at me when my battery is charged, or read texts when I\u2019m driving (Shouter Pro), apps that let me jump around to other apps (Swiftly Switch) and folder apps (Sold Explorer File Manager). There are even emulator apps for those old school games.#WidgetsThis leads me onto widgets. On iOS they are tucked into notification style boxes, but (for example) having a ToDoIst task list and my calendar widget on a home screen is much more useful. Throwing in shortcuts to a WhatsApp contact or a favourite Dropbox folder, is great (iOS has 3D touch for some shortcuts, but not all apps work with it). #Apps That iOS Will Never Have##NovaThis is the app that has sold me on Android. I can customise my phone to my heart\u2019s content. I\u2019ve been using similar apps for year - do I really need to have their names written on my phone? Just switch the names off! -  I have a massive screen, so do I really only want a small grid of apps? Just change the amount of apps you want along the horizontal and vertical! You can even resize widgets. - Would I like to position those apps into a more useful layout, change their icons (I\u2019ve even created my own custom designs), change the icon size, change how those icons function if I press or swipe on them? All possible with Nova. - Do I want to double tap the screen to text-message, swipe up to search, pinch to jump to voicemail? Yes\u2026 yes I do.OK, there are a LOT of options and even plugins (for things like adding the red notification dots on apps) - BUT the app is super easy to use, and I can\u2019t imagine using my phone without it (I love to tweak things).##Google NowAlthough there is an iOS version that does some of what \u2018Goolge Now\u2019 does on Android, it really doesn\u2019t work that well. On Android I\u2019m only a swipe away from seeing info about what\u2019s around me, stocks, news, weather, where my car\u2019s parked etc. When I went on holiday, it even pulled in my info about flights, hotels, and train links. ##Google Now On TapHold the home key and you can copy text from anywhere on the screen, or have Google act on what\u2019s on the screen. It feels a little gimmicky, but it can be occasionally useful.#Transferring filesThis almost made me take the phone back. I\u2019m used to just sticking a USB into my iPhone and having my Mac suck the photos from it, sync apps and backup. I\u2019d tried a friends Android and plugged it in, and photos and folders where just as easy to deal with. However, my Galaxy S7 just didn\u2019t want to play. After trying numerous apps and getting nowhere, I ended up using Dropbox to sync my photos in the background (which actually turned out great, as they are constantly backed-up now -see my notes on \u2018Background Multitasking).Then I discovered AirMore (I\u2019m now also trying AirDroid) - a couple of clicks, and I can essentially use my phone through my browser. Texting, screenshots, file transfer, folder search, notifications. It\u2019s slick, fast and allows really easy uploading and downloading of anything I throw at it (for example - Android is sensible enough to stick photos in the Gallery just from a quick drag & drop from the computer browser). #App StoreApple wins here - their AppStore is wonderful. Apps seem to be released first on iOS, and there is a greater proportion of solid, slick looking apps and games (my guess is that piracy rates are high and profits are low on Android). The Google Play Store is getting better though - there have been quite a few slick upgrades in just the last few weeks. One big advantage is being able to buy and install apps from your browser (so if I read a good review on my laptop, I can have the app on my phone in a couple of clicks). Also, if the app is not what you hoped, you can get a refund if you go back to the store quickly enough (2 hours I think). However, there are a LOT of poor apps on the store - for example, there may be dozens of texting apps that can become your stock app, but most look like they were designed by some tin-pot hacker looking to jump into your phone and suck its data dry. #Background multitaskingThe classic battery killer - but I\u2019m not finding any apps that churn away at my battery (I ditched the official Facebook app very early on, and moved to \u2018Swipe Pro\u2019 - another recommendation).There are some big advantages to having things run in the background though - my Dropbox happily uploads photos as soon as I\u2019m on Wifi (Dropbox on iOS would stop as soon as the app was in the background). Apps that I want to sync while I\u2019m not watching them are doing their thing, and the info I want it waiting for me (having apps stop working in the background if I\u2019ve not used them for a few days is great as well - as I have a tendency to get excited by new apps, and then forget to use them).#Fingerprint SensorThe sensor works just as well on my Galaxy S7 as it did on my iPhone (although the iPhone would recognise my print even if the phone was the upside-down, which the S7 doesn\u2019t ) - and more apps are starting to use it (thankfully my banking app does now, so typing in crazy long passwords isn\u2019t such an issue now).Throw in 1Password\u2019s keyboard and it only takes a quick fingerprint unlock to put my password into any app or website.#NotificationsI\u2019ve never really felt happy with iOS notifications - they weren\u2019t easily dismissed, some had more info than others, and once you\u2019d looked at them, they were gone from your screen (until you hunted around for the little red numbered dots all over the place, reminding you of how many things you\u2019ve missed). Android gets it right - a quick swipe down and the notifications are there for you to act on. Swipe them back up to see them later , or swipe them to the side to clear them away. I really don\u2019t miss those red dots nagging at me, and I love the more varied way of being able to interact with notifications (my bank app reminds me I\u2019m signed in, and includes a button to sign-out right in the notification bar, Spotify is there with what is playing, or reminders can be snoozed for later). You can also set whether you want the notification to show just the app name, or more info, on an app-by-app basis.#Anything Else?##ProsI stuck in a 128Gb memory card - so offline music and photos are never an issue anymore.##ConsSlow updating to the lastest Android OS - it looks like I\u2019m going to have to wait a few more months until Nougat hits my phone. But if you are going to get a Google Pixel, this won\u2019t be a problem.#ConclusionOn the whole, there isn\u2019t really all that much different about my day-to-day using of Android vs iOS. I still use a Mac and an iPad, and everything plays nicely together. But I do love the shortcuts, customisation of look and feel, and all the tweaking of gestures (via Nova). It feels like *MY* phone, instead of looking like everyone else\u2019s, and has become a good new friend in my pocket.Would I recommend Android? Well\u2026 I still think an average user would get along better with an iPhone - the whole package just works; they back themselves up and never really change much.However, I love to play with my gadgets and iOS was just starting to bore me. It was a really hard decision to jump platforms, but I\u2019m really pleased I did. I feel equally at home on either platform, but I\u2019m really happy to be on Android.Edit: formatting listsEdit 2:Wow. That's a lot of comments so far - and virtually all of them are helpful or inquisitive. I love this subreddit! **What I should add to my review based on feedback:** - Everyone should get Tasker.  - Two apps can be opened at once (a GS7 feature on Android 6, but open to all on Android 7). - No Android Pay in Canada. - No working version of Samsung Pay in Canada. - People really love a lot of different Reddit apps! - This review was really about the OS - there are too many phones and features - love the phone you have. - I've tried every tip to get my phone to be seen by my Mac, and  only Android Transfer worked (but it's a bit underwhelming). However, AirMore and AirDroid still seem like the best options for me (looking into 'Join' and 'PushBullet' though). 'Commander One' for Mac looks interesting too. - Set up a Nova gesture to easily get to Google Now (mine is now swipe up from app drawer) - Saying \"OK Google - Lumos\" and \"OK Google - Nox\" was the funniest tip I received (thanks \/user\/0x6A7232)!Edit 3 & 4: formatting lists (as Markdown suddenly doesn't seem to be working for me!)Edit 5: I've got a screenshot of my new homescreen with apps based on everyones feedback.

There were neat little [Android Experiments](https:\/\/www.androidexperiments.com\/), [demos, sticker printers](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Nexusstudio), [and sample devices](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/nexusstudio\/). And even better, there were representatives from seemingly all of the disciplines at Google involved with the new Nexus phones: Android UX design, software product managers for Nexus, Nexus industrial design, Nexus hardware engineering, and others. And they were all super friendly and surprisingly open to answering all kinds of questions, from the mundane to controversial. In the end, whether or not we might agree or disagree with their product and design decisions, I came away with a clear picture of how passionate and thoughtful the folks at Google are. Apologies for the dreadfully long post, but I wanted to share some of my experiences and the really interesting things I learned chatting with the Google staff about Nexus, Android, and technology.Before diving in, I just want to caveat here that these are merely my recollections (sorted by theme and not chronology) and were the product of casual conversations with lots of Google folks. So, each answer is often a mix of multiple people's perspectives, including my own. Please don't take this information as gospel and please forgive me if there are some inaccuracies or misinterpretations. Also any \"quotes\" I've included are for effect and are my best attempt to remember some of the really impactful or interesting tidbits I learned; I tried to honestly paraphrase and should not be read as verbatim quotes.**tl;dr: The Nexus Open Studio event was fantastic. Many people from the Nexus and Android teams were there and were incredibly friendly and open to engaging conversation. If you love learning about the small stories on Android\/Nexus development and Google, there is some really awesome stuff below like answers to the Nexus 6P display generation and more.**----------# ...On the development\/design timeline of the Nexus 5X\/6P:I learned that the design and development of a smartphone typically takes around two years. For the Nexus 5X and 6P?  ....a grueling **seven** months.# ...On the industrial design of the Nexus 5X:A lot of work went into the curvature and radius of the edges of the 5X and the camera \"hump\". The industrial designers ensured that each of the Nexus 5X's curves utilized \"C3\" continuous surfacing. It's a lot of work for a small detail, but offers significant rewards in terms of light play around the surface and how naturally\/organically the surface curves. (I admit this is all I was able to understand!)# ...On the engineering challenges to nail the industrial design of the Nexus 6P:I had personally naively assumed that since Nexus phones tended to be based off hardware designs of existing phones (the Nexus 4 and LG Optimus G, the Nexus 5 and the LG G2, etc.) that Google would be merely using established, solved industrial design processes that were well known by the manufacturing partner. It was interesting to find out that a lot of experimentation and testing still went into things like the bead blasting process and the diamond-cut chamfer.I had imagined that much like going to a paint store and picking from a huge wall of swatches, that the colors and finishes were a known and well-established thing for a manufacturing partner\u2014they just merely needed to be selected. However, even something like the media used in the bead blasting process still needed constant testing and refinement. The Nexus engineers and designers tried a variety of media like coconut shells, glass beads\u2014> *\"We spent lots of time over in China pulling samples fresh off the bead blasting manufacturing line, running over to a window, and scrutinizing the way the light played off the surface.\"*All told, there were around 80 different manufacturing steps for the Nexus 6P (and fun fact: Google dictated that all of the aluminum leftovers in manufacturing were to be collected and reused\/recycled). In fact, the circumferential chamfer that wraps around the visor is actually an industry first, using a brand-new process. In addition there were other major challenges in terms of managing the RF with an all metal phone\u2014making sure antennas weren't detuned by the aluminium body through careful injection molding processes. # ...On the relationship between the Nexus manufacturing partner and Google:I was surprised to learn that the manufacturing partner relationship can be a mixed bag and even depends on the partner (see next topic). Even with the latest Nexus 5X and 6P where Google exercised a considerable amount of design influence, there was a give and take between the manufacturing partner and Google. Oftentimes there was pushback from the partner for the sake engineering or manufacturing convenience\u2014one designer mentioned that it was three-months of back and forth *just* to get the USB Type-C connector centered on the bottom of the 6P. Another had referred to the bottom of the recently announced HTC A9 as evidence of design by cost and engineering convenience. He was sympathetic though, as he recognized that for many of Google's OEM partners, the teams live and die by the success (or lack thereof) of a single product launch, and so cost (in both design and manufacturing) is a legitimate consideration. Google, however, can afford to take a longer view on cost and invest in trying to hit a higher bar of design. The relationship was a lot of work (one Google engineer spent about two of the seven month development time over in China overseeing things), but it seems like both the [manufacturing partners](http:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/huawei-exec-nexus-6p-dream-also-challenging-one?utm_source=ac&utm_medium=dlvrit) and Nexus engineers and designers were really happy with the end result.# ...On the Nexus family design language and the Motorola Nexus 6:Following up on this, I asked about the Nexus 6 and the manufacturing partner selected for that generation, Motorola. Its design seemed to share more with other phones in the Motorola family than it did with any other device in the Nexus family. > *\"...Somebody backed out at the last minute.\"*I didn't poke any further, but it was added that as a manufacturing partner, Motorola exercised tighter control over the design and engineering of the phone, in a way vastly different from other Nexus partners. It sounded like Google designers and engineers (obviously) preferred the more Google-directed partnership, so this may be the last we see of a Nexus 6-ish device with a design that deviates so much from the Nexus family language. (And you all can read between the lines there.)# ...On the lessons learned from the Nexus 6:The team there recognized and acknowledged a lot of the complaints\/problems of the Nexus 6. It was too big, too bulky, hard to use one handed, and worst of all\u2014> *\"...the Nexus 6 spun around when you tried to use it on a table.\"*Along with the fact that the Nexus 5 was Google's best selling Nexus phone, this seemed to set the stage for what we see with the Nexus 5X and 6P today. First, a return to the tried-and-true formula of the Nexus 5, but with updated hardware and a modernized design for 2015. On the Nexus 6P, there were obviously more design changes. For one thing, the screen shrinkage from 6\" to 5.7\" seems small, but vastly improved one-handed use. Also, they were proud that they were able to fit a 5.7\" size screen into a device with the same phone size as competitors with a smaller 5.5\" screen (clearly a reference to the iPhone 6 Plus). In addition, the visor was a key design component addition. For one thing, an all-metal frame did need RF windows for sensors, cellular reception, etc. But moreover, the full-width visor allowed for a stable base... and no more spinning phones on tables. \ud83d\ude04# ...On the just-barely \"off center\" placement of the camera module in the Nexus 6P visor:I really enjoyed this particular story of the design and engineering hurdles with the Nexus 6P: Astute owners of the Nexus 6P might notice that the [camera lens is just-oh-so-slightly above the center axis of the oval camera \"surround\"](http:\/\/forums.androidcentral.com\/attachments\/nexus-6p\/202819d1445644158t-nexus-6p-build-quality-rear-glass-visor-gap-google-nexus-6p-review-camera.jpg) it sits within. Well, it turns out it wasn't just some design oversight.Thanks to the all-aluminum design of the Nexus 6P, all of the RF (wireless) \"stuff\" and sensors needs to fit within either the visor or the bottom plastic RF \"windows\". This includes the [NFC sensor](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), which was even of a special design that allowed for a small part of the sensor to sit \"above the fold\" in the RF window, while the rest was below (check out the teardown photo and you'll see). When it came to QC test the NFC sensor in the Nexus 6P's first iteration... **it failed**. Not enough of the sensor had been exposed in the visor, and they had to painfully widen the visor just a little. Well, the camera had originally been symmetrically aligned in the visor, but when they widened it, the camera was now off center (and unable to be moved around anymore because of design and timing limitations). To help conceal the now slightly-off center nature of the camera within the visor, the design team threw in the oval camera surround.# ...On bucking the trend of thinner phones with smaller batteries:When discussing the Nexus 6P \"visor hump\", I mentioned that one of the frequent suggestions I've seen in terms of eliminating humps altogether was to just maintain thickness on a phone and use the added volume for more battery capacity. The engineer just shrugged and replied:> *\"Apple really sets the bar on thinness there.\"*# ...On the Nexus 6P and 5X placement of the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:The Nexus design team considered and spent a lot of time researching three different fingerprint sensor locations before settling on the rear placement we know today: the bottom front (e.g., Samsung\/iPhone), the side power button (e.g., Sony Xperia), and the center rear. Designers liked the discoverability and accessibility of the Samsung\/iPhone model, but felt that the bottom edge placement placed all the weight of the phone aft of the sensor and there was a cantilevering effect that was both awkward and increased the risk of dropping. The side positioning had limitations based upon the thinness of the phone and those limitations would reduce the surface area available to read a fingerprint. The backside approach allowed for a large surface area to capture a fingerprint, was where the index finger naturally fell, and also was suitable for both right and left-handed users. > *\"As you scale the phone, the fingerprint sensor does not move\u2014because it's not based on [the size of] the phone, it's based on the human hand.\"*The backside sensor approach also had the benefit of being scalable and independent of phone size, which was particularly relevant for the two-sized Nexus launch. It was pointed out that the fingerprint sensor was in an almost identical location on both the Nexus 5X and 6P, despite the differences in the size of the phones. The hardware engineer conceded that the industrial designers were so passionate about perfecting the fingerprint sensor location that...> *\"In fact, [the industrial designers] were so adamant about basing this on the human hand [we had to compromise on the battery size](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), to make sure he got his way\u2014**to make sure it fit the human hand.**\"*# ...On how Google tested and benchmarked the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:Google wanted a quantitative way to measure the speed of the fingerprint sensor while they were optimizing its speed. So, Google engineers built a rig with a robot \"hand\" and highspeed camera for testing and benchmarking the fingerprint sensor. However, the missing link was what to use for the actual fleshy finger stand-in. > *\"The product manager for fingerprint... she was having lunch one day in the cafe and she was having chicken drumsticks. And she realized that the skin of the chicken drumstick is really similar to the human hand. So she took a batch of chicken drumsticks, took it upstairs to the lab, washed it, picked off a bit and tied it to the robot, and used that to measure the latency of the fingerprint sensor.\"*# ...On sourcing the new Sony camera module:The camera was clearly the major highlight of the event (other than the Nexus Imprint, both of which had key presentations), and many of the team I spoke with were incredibly proud of it. One product manager proudly noted that the sensor sourced was an industry-first and that it was pulled from Sony's digital camera parts bin (and not mobile camera menu).One of the things I learned from the team was that picking out a sensor is not merely just the picking of a sensor from a parts menu. In every implementation, Sony needs to attach a team to support the integration of the camera sensor. Sony was initially concerned that the sales volumes wouldn't be sufficient on the Nexus phones to be worth the investment for Google to reach so deep into their premium parts menu. It took a lot of convincing to get Sony onboard to provide Google this particular camera module. Thankfully it turns out Sony was really satisfied about the press and acclaim it received in connection with the new Nexus phones and their stellar camera.# ...On the absence of camera OIS:Sony did not offer this particular camera module with an OIS option.# ...On the Nexus 6P display, and whether it is a \u201ccurrent generation\u201d Samsung AMOLED display:> *\u201c...The Nexus 6P actually uses the same display panel as the Note 5\u201d*Knowing that this is a hot topic on \/r\/android, I brought up the fact that testing has shown that on the Nexus 6P, its display has a lower maximum brightness and higher display power consumption than seen on the Note 5\u2014key indicators of the AMOLED panel generation\u2014I received knowing acknowledgement. So it turns out that the display panel is the same, but that much like the practice of CPU\/SoC binning, there is variation inherent in AMOLED panel fabrication. Here, Google was able to procure the lower binned, yet current-generation displays from Samsung for the Nexus 6P. # ...On the thermals of the Snapdragon 810 SoC:The thermals of the Snapdragon 810 were known to Google and were of some concern. Qualcomm attached a team of engineers to help control thermals and supplied Google with a *third* version of the Snapdragon 810 (which when I got home, seems to match public, well-established reports that the Nexus 6P uses the v2.1 version of the 810).# ...On the removal of wireless charging from the Nexus 5X and 6P:It sounded like the intention to go with a never-been-done-before-on-Nexus all-aluminum design had a big role to play. The Qi wireless charging was not going to work on the metal back, and so it needed to be dropped. For the Nexus 5X, even though it had a plastic design, the product team consciously wanted to maintain a certain feature parity\/consistency between the two models (like in the same way they kept the same camera, flash, IR sensor, etc.) Furthermore, the reduced pain point of the universal direction USB Type C connector added onto the decision to drop wireless Qi charging.# ...On the Nexus 6P\"Bendgate\" controversy:All of the Nexus phones go through rigorous strength and wear testing. When the videos first broke out about the \"Nexus 6P Bendgate\", the engineers rushed back into the labs to double-check and rerun the tests to make sure they hadn't missed anything. The engineer I spoke with indicated that nearly all phones are strength tested to similar specifications and all have their first \"bend\" at a similar weight pressure\u2014he quoted the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6P to be around 40-45 kgs on the particular bending bench. Apparently, where phones vary is the ultimate failure strength (the amount of pressure for the phone to catastrophically fail after a first bend), but the pressure-to-first-bend was apparently consistent across most phones.# ...On the \"twist to launch\" camera action that was apparently pulled from the Nexus 6P:According to one product manager I spoke to about this, the feature didn't test well and was never formally implemented as opposed to being dropped\/pulled. It was an accident it was included on websites.# ...On controversial topics like internal storage and integrated batteries:I asked some of the product managers what they thought about the controversies over internal storage and integrated batteries\u2014particularly whether there was any truth to the theories that the limited internal storage was really an initiative to push users to cloud storage or that integrated batteries were there for planned obsolescence. The product managers were quite genuine and adamant that there were no ulterior motives and that things really boiled down to usability and design tradeoffs. On the internal storage side, they noted that this was an interesting and complex issue, and first pointed out that when they balance tradeoffs for a feature like expandable microSD storage, the same balance isn't made the same way for every market. For example, on Android One phones, the usability issues with microSD was outweighed by the need for price sensitivity and the greater challenges of single-up-front payment\u2014and this use case is reflected in the inclusion of microSD in Android One designs and in Marshmallow's stronger adoption of external storage. However, on the Nexus side, the usability issues with microSD won the day. The product managers were concerned about things like slower, poorer quality microSD cards and microSD failure that were challenging for users to self-diagnose when there were multiple kinds of storage. A single, high quality internal storage solved this issue (at the cost of expandability). They also noted that in addition to considering users, a single unified storage was easier and more predictable for developers\u2014a single fast and reliable internal storage meant better predictability on app performance, less problems with defining where to put files, and reduced troubleshooting\/customer service.We didn't get into the battery question as much, but the product managers noted that they really cared about the products they build. If they could have it their way, their phones would be timeless in a way similar to \"like a Gucci bag,\" with great longevity and resale value evidencing the quality of their product. So they too are disappointed with the inherent problems of lithium ion batteries. That said, the design benefits to an integrated battery were so great that the balance of tradeoffs really went in favor of non-removable batteries.Anyway, as a personal aside, I know these are really hot button topics on \/r\/android and for those folks that firmly sit on one side of the fence or the other, I'm not entirely sure any justification or rationale can be said that would be truly satisfying. I still hope this shed some additional light on the topic though!# ...On feedback on the Nexus products and Android UI:Everyone I spoke with was really open to hearing about feedback and even criticism. Many of them even browse \/r\/android and are well aware of the passionate \"feedback\" that users voice here. \ud83d\ude04 Some noted that they definitely have heard the requests for a smaller, more premium phone instead of the premium 6P phablet and economical 5X phone. They said they are always looking into the decisions around this and are always rethinking those decisions for the next generation.Another noted that in addition to the outside user feedback, they hear a lot of the same sentiment directly after the launch of a new feature or device. The engineers, designers, and other Googlers are a very vocal and strongly opinionated group and are frequently dogfooding and using their own products. I asked one of the UX designers what one of the most controversial things was that she had worked on\u2014she confessed that she worked on and helped to implement the [bolded hour digit in the Jelly Bean clock app](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/nexusae0_155.png). ...She noted with a smile that the reaction of Google staff on this change alone was swift and unequivocal.# ...On the functionality and evolution of Android volume control:A presentation was devoted to the user experience design and evolution of Android volume control from pre-Lollipop, to Lollipop, to Marshmallow and I also had an opportunity to chat with the UX designer on this. It would take too long to fully discuss each of the design decisions and cases they considered, but it was really neat to see the amount of user testing that went into this. I also gained a stronger appreciation of the challenges with something as superficially simple and innocent as \"volume control\"\u2014there are a serious amount of different permutations and use cases of alarms and volume control. These challenges were compounded by the fact that unlike many of Google's apps that are now decoupled from the OS and are updated routinely on the Play Store, volume control is still tightly woven into the OS. The UX team needs to finalize their decisions well before the launch of the OS and only has an annual window for which to make changes. # ...On the sale of Motorola to Lenovo:Google's OEM partners were really concerned that despite the firewalls between the two organizations, that there was too much threat that a Google-Motorola would turn into a fully vertical entity like Apple (or Microsoft today with its Surface tablets), squeezing out its partners in the Android ecosystem. When I asked why the OEM partners were okay with the Nexus program, it sounded like the Nexus sales were still quite relatively small compared to the bigger OEM players (Samsung, LG, etc.) and were not threatening. # ...On the Nexus 6P three-microphone noise cancellation:I thought I had seen on the [iFixit teardown](https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Nexus+6P+Teardown\/51660) that two of the advertised \u201c3 microphones (2 front, 1 rear) with noise cancellation\u201d were located within each of the front-facing speaker grills, but wasn't sure given the risks of interference from the speakers. It turns out the microphones are in fact in the speaker grills, and that they can be spaced in a way that minimizes interference from the speakers.# ...On the rumors of the next iPhone to pull the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of the Lightning connector:> *\"If anyone can do it, it's Apple and Beats.\"*The engineer noted that we've been stuck with the same form factor and technology on the 3.5mm analog jack for decades and figuring out the placement of it is a consistent design challenge and design limitation. There are a lot of new design opportunities afforded by moving to a new connector and opportunities around digital audio output (headphones with audiophile DACs and amps instead of relying on those in your phone!) and although Google doesn't really have the leverage to initiate a change like this, Apple definitely does\u2014especially through its ownership of Beats.# ...On knowing the name of the next Android version:The dessert naming decision of the next version of Android is not known to most Googlers, even those in the Android UX design team. So they are as surprised as everyone else when the statue is finally unveiled. However, while they don't often know the what the *right* choice will be for a name, they often know what it *won't be*, so internal and code references to wordy names like \"Lemon Meringue Pie\" were placed with tongues firmly in cheeks. The team at Google also had a lot of fun when David Burke trolled the community with his [infamous \"milkshake\" watch stunt](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/2015\/05\/28\/io-2015-dave-burke-wears-android-wear-watch-with-a-picture-of-a-milkshake-on-it-during-io-presentation-internet-freaks-out\/).","594":"**TL;DR:** NFC Smart Unlock has been removed for all newly signed in Google Accounts on Android.

Those users are entitled to the features that they have paid for.As the issue tracker site is not publicly viewable hopefully this thread serves as a legitimate resource for people to refer to, hence the long post here.&nbsp;**FAQ**&nbsp;**What is NFC Smart Unlock?**NFC Smart Unlock allows a user to unlock their Near Field Communication Enabled Android phone using a physical token or card. Many companies sell NFC Rings or Wristbands specifically to be used for Device unlocking and authentication. NFC Smart Unlock allows an NFC Tag or accessory to act like a Physical key to access a device. This type of authentication technology is also very common in the enterprise as well as with Hotels and Apartment Building complexes.&nbsp;**What Devices or Android Versions are affected?**All Versions of Android with Smart Unlock are affected (5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0). The NFC Smart Unlock feature is remotely enabled\/disabled by Google. Internet Access is necessary to activate All Smart Unlock Features (Voice, Face, Bluetooth etc). Contrary to popular belief the Version of Google Play Services Installed Does Not affect the availability of the feature. There has been a recent increase in the number of people reporting this issue due to users installing updates and upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo. As more users upgrade their devices in the months to come more people are likely to lose this access to this feature.&nbsp;**My Device still has NFC Smart Unlock are you sure it's just not a Bug?**This issue currently affects All NEW Android Device Logins. If you setup your device or signed into your Google Account in June 2017 or earlier then you should not be affected. If you perform a device factory reset or flash a new ROM Image then NFC Smart Unlock will not be available to you anymore. Currently there is no know 'fix' as this feature has been *\"deprecated\"* by Google.&nbsp;**Why has this happened?**30-Sep-17 - Google have provided an official statement regarding the removal, that statement and more information can be found in [this reddit thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/73ejrk\/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives). Currently (27-Sep-17) Google have not officially provided a reason for the removal of the NFC Smart Unlock Feature. The feature was disabled very quietly and without a warning or notice to users. NFC Smart Unlock is still listed as a feature on Google's [Pixel](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) and [Nexus](https:\/\/support.google.com\/nexus\/answer\/6093922?hl=en) Online Help Documentation as of Sep 27. It is also listed in the Device Manual for New Android 8.0 Devices such as the [Xperia XZ1](https:\/\/support.sonymobile.com\/global-en\/xperiaxz1\/userguide\/unlocking-your-device-automatically\/). My best guess would be it is some sort of Legal or Patent issue but as this feature has been available for a few years it does seem strange.&nbsp;**Are there any alternative options or workarounds?**As far as I know there are some options using third party apps but there isn't currently any known work around to re-enable the Google NFC Unlock Feature. Regardless users shouldn't have to use a third party app to gain back functionality they already had access to. Not to mention the potentially major security and privacy issues that come with using a third party app.&nbsp;**Why Does this Matter?**Google has removed an important device feature silently without notice or warning to customers. This speaks volumes about how Google treats its customers. This also serves as a general warning to be mindful of this sort behaviour from Google. As Android Users we have a right to the features we paid for on the hardware we paid for. And if those software features need to be removed for some reason legal or otherwise then we deserve a warning beforehand and a reason saying exactly what is happening, why it is happening and what alternative options or potential resolutions there may be.&nbsp;**Background Information\/Testing\/Proof** If you want my detailed testing and breakdown information then check post #4 on the [Issue Tracker thread](https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/65425413).&nbsp;**Opinion**It would perhaps be more reasonable if this feature was removed for only new Google Accounts and all existing Android users got grandfathered in but this hasn't happened. I do find the wording on the issue tracker to be very questionable. > \"SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden.\" I am not a \"new user\" I have been using Android since 2012 and have had a Google Account for nearly 10 years, I'm hardly a \"new user\". Even if you use the *new* device approach, I had the feature when I setup my device in June but now I do not, how am I not an \"existing NFC user\". I suspect Google plan for this to be at least a somewhat permanent change and if that ends up being the case it will really impact the companies and brands that make and sell NFC rings, wristbands and key-fobs etc. This move basically destroys a significant chunk of their business. Not to mention the investment from users in NFC Tags, Fobs and in some cases bio-implants. Fortunately for me I've only bought Stickers.&nbsp;**Other Relevant NFC Unlock Bug Report Thread**&nbsp;There is also another NFC Smart Unlock Issue Tracker thread where users are complaining that the NFC Unlock Feature doesn't work very reliability on their devices. This thread has also been seen by a Google Employee and they state quote \"We've deferred this [issue?] to a future release, but leaving this open for now.\" Link: https:\/\/issuetracker.google.com\/issues\/62268615&nbsp;","595":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r\/samsung](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samsung\/) and [r\/galaxys10](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line \"powered by 360\". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo\\_360](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qihoo_360)).If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998](https:\/\/www.ithome.com.tw\/news\/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \\[dot\\] cn, wshifen \\[dot\\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv](https:\/\/imgur.com\/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their \"Big Data   platform\", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the \"nothing to hide\" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.","597":"Hi \/r\/Android, if you don't know me, I'm Mishaal Rahman, the guy who wrote that absurdly long [Android 13 changelog article](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/wek1m8\/android_13_changelog_a_deep_dive\/) that was posted to this subreddit recently. I'm grateful to anyone who read it, but I realize that its length is a bit daunting for many people. With Android 13's release on the horizon, I decided to put together a summary just for y'all.  Below you'll find my curated list of changes in Android 13 that I think users like you will care about\/should be aware of. Each item in the list links to the relevant section in my article for those of you who want the full details, but I'll also provide a summary under each item for a quick tl;dr. I've roughly ordered the list by features users will care about most followed by more obscure features, and yes, you may not care about everything in this list. Still, there's a lot that's new in Android 13, so I hope you find a few things you're excited about!However, note this list doesn't mention [*everything* new in Android 13](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/) because that'd just make this post way too long. This post doesn't mention any changes specific to Android TV 13, features exclusive to Pixel, and changes that only app developers will care about. I'll make separate posts for those things on their respective subreddits. With that out of the way, here's the list: 1. [**Runtime permission for notifications**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#notification_permission). Apps will now have to ask for permission before they can post a notification. Android 13 handles this permission differently based on what Android version the app targets and whether or not it's newly installed or it was already installed before updating to Android 13, but this generally makes notifications opt-in rather than opt-out. [Example](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-runtime-permission-for-notifications.png?w=598&ssl=1).2. [**New Material You dynamic color styles**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#material_you_styles). Android 12 on Pixel phones introduced Google's dynamic color engine, which grabs a color from your wallpaper to generate 5 tonal palettes. Each of these tonal palettes is comprised of 13 tonal colors of various luminances but with undefined hue and chroma values. By adjusting these values, the color engine can create a bunch of new palettes, ie. \"styles.\" tl;dr, Android 13 generates far more theme options based on your wallpaper, letting you pick even more colors than before to suit your style. Examples: [TONAL_SPOT (default)](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-TONAL_SPOT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [VIBRANT](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-VIBRANT-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [EXPRESSIVE](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-EXPRESSIVE-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [SPRITZ](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-SPRITZ-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [RAINBOW](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-RAINBOW-style.png?w=613&ssl=1), [FRUIT_SALAD](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-Material-You-FRUIT_SALAD-style.png?w=613&ssl=1). (Although Google's dynamic color engine was initially exclusive to Pixels on Android 12, [it was added to AOSP in Android 12L](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_dynamiccolorsaosp) and is thus now available by default for all OEM builds. The ThemePicker enhancements that Google made are going to be open source, so OEM devices should be able to surface the same style options that Pixels do.)3.

The colors generated by Android's dynamic color engine can be used to theme homescreen icons as well as in-app UI elements. If you enable the \"themed icons\" option in Wallpaper & Style (the location of this switch could be different on OEM devices), then apps with a monochromatic icon will have that icon be automatically themed according to the user's wallpaper. [Before](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-disabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1) versus [After](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Themed-icons-enabled-in-Android-13.png?w=613&ssl=1).4. [**Bigger and bolder gesture nav bar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). The gesture nav pill is bigger and bolder than before. This is one of the first things you'll probably notice when booting up Android 13. I'm not sure if OEMs can\/will tweak this, though. [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_n2JXoAAAkX4?format=jpg&name=large) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUv_oPwXoAIqqMP?format=jpg&name=large).5. [**Per-app language preferences**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#per_app_languages). Finally, you can set the language of an app without changing the language system-wide in settings. You can access the new per-app language preferences in Settings > System > Languages & input > App Languages. Only apps that have opted-in, however, will appear in this list. [Screenshot of App Language page for Google Calendar.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-app-language-settings-for-Google-Calendar.png?w=613&ssl=1) 6. [**Photo Picker**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#system_photo_picker). There's a new Photo Picker that will let you quickly pick images or videos to share with apps. Those apps then get temporary, read-only access to those media files. Apps have to add support for the Photo Picker, but this is quite easy to do and will be available through many libraries soon. Plus, the Photo Picker has already rolled out to Android 11-12L devices through a Google Play System Update, so expect to see a lot of apps add support for this in the near future. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Android-Photo-Picker.png?w=598&ssl=1)7. [**Clipboard editor overlay**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_editor_overlay). When you copy something to the clipboard, you'll see an overlay in the bottom left corner, similar to when you take a screenshot. This overlay previews what you copied and can show smart actions based on the clip content (open a URL in Chrome, navigate to an address in Maps, etc.) You can also tap the clip preview to launch a text or image editor. Screenshots: [1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-2.png?w=598&ssl=1), [2](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-3.png?w=598&ssl=1), [3](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-clipboard-overlay-4.png?w=598&ssl=1)8. [**QR code scanner shortcut**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#qr_code_shortcut). Android 13 by default will show a Quick Setting tile to launch a QR code scanner. Which app provides the QR code scanner is technically configurable by OEMs, but I believe on devices with [GMS](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android\/), it will be set up to launch a QR code scanner provided by Google Play Services. [Screenshot of QS tile.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Quick-Setting-tile-for-QR-code-scanner-enabled.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of QR scanner.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-QR-code-scanner-powered-by-GMS-1.png?w=613&ssl=1)9. [**Redesigned media player**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_player_ui_redesign). Android 13 revamps the media player experience. You'll notice the [larger volume slider](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Redesigned-media-output-picker-in-Android-13.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1) in the media output picker UI and the [squiggly progress bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Beta-2-media-player-UI.png?w=598&ssl=1) for all media sessions. There's one other change that I'll mention next. Do note that OEMs can customize the default style of notifications, so there's no guarantee the media player will look exactly the same across devices.10. [**New media controls UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_controls_playbackstate). Apps that target Android 13 may show a different set of media controls when running on Android 13. This is because Android 13 derives what media controls to show from the PlaybackState rather than the MediaStyle notification. If you see headlines about apps being updated to support Android 13 media controls, this is what they're referring to. [Here's a screenshot](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Media-Controls-derived-from-PlaybackState.png?resize=949%2C500&ssl=1) of media controls on a phone and tablet running Android 13. As you can see, this change unifies how media controls are rendered across Android platforms.11. [**Better control over foreground services**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#foreground_service_manager). There's a new \"active app\" button in the notifications panel. Tap this and you'll see which apps currently have a foreground service running. For example, music players and fitness trackers need to use foreground services so Android won't kill them when they're running in the background. Before Android 13, these foreground services took up space in your notifications panel. Now, you can swipe them away and manage them from the \"active app\" list. [Screenshot of the \"active app\" button in the notifications panel.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager-in-notifications-panel.png?w=613&ssl=1) [Screenshot of the \"active app\" list.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-foreground-service-manager.png?w=613&ssl=1)12. [**Game dashboard for more devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#game_dashboard). The Game Dashboard that was originally exclusive to the Pixel 6 on Android 12 is coming to more devices on Android 13. Game Dashboard integrates achievements and leaderboards data from Play Games, has a shortcut to stream to YouTube, and has toggles to show a screenshot button, screen recorder button, DND button, and an FPS counter in the in-game floating overlay. You can also change the Game Mode to \"battery saver\" or \"performance\", but this depends on the game. This feature is provided by Google Play Services on Android 13 and has rolled out to several Pixel devices already, but I believe it will come to non-Pixels in the future. [Screenshot of Game Dashboard settings.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2NXEAA1Ssg?format=jpg&name=large) [Screenshot of Game Dashboard.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FWjyk2LXEAI8HYQ?format=jpg&name=large)13. [**Game Mode improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#fps_intervention). When a game hasn't added support for the Game Mode API, OEMs can apply game mode interventions to improve the performance of games. In Android 12, OEMs could use ANGLE instead of OpenGLES drivers or apply WindowManager backbuffer resize to reduce the GPU overload. In Android 13, there's a new FPS override intervention, but this one is opt in. When games  opt in, the system can limit the FPS that the game runs at. 14. [**Bluetooth LE Audio support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_le_audio). Bluetooth LE Audio is the next-gen Bluetooth standard that promises lower power consumption, higher quality audio (compared to Bluetooth Classic Audio with SBC) with the new LC3 codec, standardized support for hearing aids, location-based audio sharing, and support for broadcasting audio to many devices. Android 13 ships with a Bluetooth stack that's certified for LE Audio Unicast support (Broadcast Audio is a WIP). 15. [**Spatial audio with head tracking support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#spatial_audio_head_tracking_settings). Spatial audio provides an immersive audio experience by making it seem like the audio moves with your head. Android supports static spatial audio (where the sound seems to move as your head moves) and dynamic spatial audio (where the sound is stuck in space as your head moves). Static spatial audio works with any headphones, while dynamic spatial audio requires a headset with head tracking support. Android 12L added the [audio spatializer API](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_audiospatialization) needed for integration with third-party apps, while Android 13 introduces the head tracking protocol needed for dynamic spatial audio.16. [**Turn on dark mode at bedtime**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dark_mode_bedtime). Dark theme settings now has an option to have it turn on at bedtime. Your bedtime mode schedule is set by the Digital Wellbeing app. [Screenshot.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-schedule-dark-mode-to-turn-on-at-bedtime.png?w=613&ssl=1)17. [**Control smart home devices without unlocking the device**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#control_without_auth). You can now control smart home devices from the Device Controls menu without unlocking your phone or tablet, but only if the app supports it. You first need to enable \"control from locked device\" in settings. [Video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Po96y5IvsIs).18. [**7-day view in privacy dashboard**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#7_day_privacy_dashboard). The \"Privacy dashboard\" added in Android 12 only shows sensitive permissions accessed in the last 24 hours, but on Android 13, it'll let you see that data from the last 7 days. This hasn't rolled out yet, though. [Screenshot of \"show 7 days\" option in privacy dashboard.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-show-7-days-toggle-in-privacy-dashboard-settings.png?w=613&ssl=1)19. [**Clipboard auto clear**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#clipboard_auto_clear). Android 13 will automatically clear any clipboard item that's older than 1 hour. I know Gboard already does this, but not everyone uses Gboard.20. [**X-axis transition animation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). Any apps that don't use a custom transition animation seem to now use [this shared X-axis transition animation.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1524484117550796802) 21. [**Flashlight brightness control**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#flashlight_brightness). Android 13 has an API to control the flashlight brightness. Yes, OEMs like Samsung have offered this feature for years, but it wasn't standardized. The only catch is that the OEM has to implement support for this feature in the device's camera HAL. [More info on this feature.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-flashlight-brightness-control\/) [Demo + sample app.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1557802529567694848)22. [**Unified Security & Privacy settings**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#security_and_privacy_settings). Android has a lot of privacy and security features strewn about in settings. Android 13's new unified Security & Privacy settings will make it easy to find each of these features. This is not exclusive to Pixel and will be coming to other devices via a Mainline update. [Here's what it looks like.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-unified-Security-Privacy-settings.png?w=833&ssl=1)23. [**\"Vibrant\" theme is now actually vibrant**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#miscellaneous_changes). There was a bug that made the color palette generated from vibrant wallpapers less vibrant than they should be. This was fixed in Android 13, and now the Vibrant theme is actually vibrant! [Before](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKSaGXEAAQ_63?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) versus [After](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FUwKU4uWIAAf39H?format=jpg&name=large).24. [**App drawer in the taskbar**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#taskbar_app_drawer). Android 12L [introduced the taskbar](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-12l-deep-dive\/#android12l_taskbar), but it didn't have an app drawer, so you had to go to the home screen or recent apps to switch apps. Android 13 fixes this by adding an app drawer in the taskbar. (Yes, I know the Z Fold4 on 12L has an app drawer in the taskbar. Kudos to Samsung for addressing that.) [Screenshot of taskbar with app drawer.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-DP2-taskbar-with-app-drawer.png?w=613&ssl=1)25. [**Stylus handwriting**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#stylus_handwriting). Keyboard apps can declare that they support stylus handwriting. If so, then other apps can send a request to launch the keyboard app in its stylus handwriting mode. This is currently in testing and requires flipping a developer option called \"stylus handwriting\". [You can see this in action with the S22 Ultra on Android 13 + Google Chrome.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1555960332970967040)26. [**File managers can no longer access \/Android\/data and \/Android\/obb**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#saf_block_android_subdir_access). Do you use a third-party file manager? Do you ever access files in the \/Android\/obb or \/Android\/data folders? Well I have bad news for you. You won't be able to use your favorite file managers to access those folders anymore, since the loophole they used to do was [has been closed.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-28-file-manager-loophole-closed-73891524\/) Yes, this was only possible through a loophole, since [Scoped Storage in Android 11](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/) was designed to block apps from accessing those folders.27. [**Android may block the user from enabling Accessibility and Notification Listeners for sideloaded apps**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#restricted_settings_appop). Android's Accessibility and Notification Listener APIs are really powerful, and they're often abused by malware. Google has been cracking down on apps misusing APIs, and in Android 13, you'll be blocked from enabling an app's Accessibility Service or Notification Listener if you sideloaded that app from outside an app store. (There is a way to unblock access, fortunately.) The exact details are more complicated, so [I recommend reading this article for the full breakdown.](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-sideloading-restriction-harder-malware-abuse-accessibility-apis\/) [Screenshot of the \"Restricted Setting\" dialog](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-Restricted-Settings-dialog.png?w=598&ssl=1) and the [toggle to allow restricted settings.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Allow-restricted-settings-on-Android-13.png?w=598&ssl=1)28. [**Apps can now only request one-time access to device logs**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#one_time_logcat_access). If you grant an app the ability to read system logs (ie. logcat), then in Android 13, you'll see a confirmation dialog every time that app tries to read those logs. If you use an automation app like Tasker, you might hate this change. [Screenshot of the dialog.](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FSkkburXwAYJcjo?format=jpg&name=large)29. [**More granular media file permissions**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#media_file_permissions). Scoped Storage [changed how apps access files](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/how-scoped-storage-works\/), making it so that the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission doesn't grant broad access to the external shared storage. Instead, it only let apps access media files (including audio, video, and image files) owned by other apps that reside in media store collections. In Android 13, apps targeting the release will have the request individual permissions to access audio files, video files, or image files owned by other apps, making media file access even more granular.30. [**Revamped multi-user UI**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#table-of-contents:~:text=Squiggly%20progress%20bar-,Multiuser,-Fullscreen%20user%20profile). There's a couple of enhancements to the multi-user experience in Android 13. First of all, there's a new [fullscreen user profile switcher](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-fullscreen-user-switcher.png?resize=231%2C500&ssl=1) for large screen devices. There's also a revamped UI for [adding a new user](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-1.png?w=598&ssl=1) that even uses the new Photo Picker to [select the profile picture from your gallery](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-new-user-creation-UI-2.png?w=598&ssl=1). Next, there's an optional user profile switcher shortcut that [sits in the status bar](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Android-13-status-bar-user-switcher-1.png?w=598&ssl=1), but it's disabled by default and intended for large screen devices. Finally, there's an optional user switcher shortcut [on the keyguard](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-bouncer-user-switcher-3.png?w=613&ssl=1), but again, this may only appear on tablets or other large screen devices.31. [**Accessibility audio description**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_audio_description). There's a new toggle to enable audio descriptions globally. Instead of toggling audio descriptions on a per-app basis, media apps can read the status of this global toggle and enable audio descriptions accordingly. This is more aimed at Android TV but is also applicable to handhelds. [Screenshot of the toggle.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Android-13-audio-description-accessibility-toggle.png?resize=236%2C500&ssl=1)32. [**Accessibility magnifier can now follow the text as you type**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#accessibility_magnifier_follow_text). If you use the magnification feature to zoom in on text, you might like the new \"follow typing\" toggle that's been added. Toggling this will make the magnification area automatically follow the text as you type. [Here's a demo of the feature.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bLDCkBOKBKg)33. [**Quick Settings tiles for color correction & one-handed mode**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#new_qs_tiles). If you use Android's color correction or one-handed mode feature and want quick access to toggle them, you can find new Quick Settings tiles to do so in Android 13.34. [**Drag to launch multiple instances of an app in split-screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#drag_launch_multi_instance_split_screen). Android 12 added multi-instance support, making it possible to launch two instances of the same activity. For example, you can launch two Chrome windows in split-screen mode. Android 13 builds on this by letting you drag to launch a second instance of an activity when in split-screen view, provided the activity supports it.35. [**Take away an app's ability to turn on the screen**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#turn_screen_on_permission). There's a new \"turn screen on\" permission that you can control in Settings > Apps > Special app access. It's quite self-explanatory. [Here's a screenshot of the permission page.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog.esper.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Android-13-turn-screen-on-permission-page.png?w=613&ssl=1)36. [**Control background access of body sensors**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#background_body_sensors). Apps can access data from heart rate, temperature, and blood oxygen level sensors through the BODY_SENSORS permission. Prior to Android 13, apps that had this permission could access that data while running in the background. Android 13 changes this by making those apps request a new permission called BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND.37. [**Apps no longer need location access to scan for nearby WiFi devices**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#nearby_wifi_devices). It's possible to track your location by collecting data on nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices over time, which is why earlier versions of Android made it so apps had to hold location permissions to read Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scan results. That got annoying and confusing for users, so Android 12 decoupled Bluetooth APIs from the location permission. Android 13 follows up by decoupling Wi-Fi scanning from location permissions.38. [**Virtualization support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#virtualization). This one is really complicated, but basically, Android 13 introduces a virtual machine framework through the new Virtualization module. Google is deploying a modified version of the Linux KVM feature (pKVM to be precise) as the hypervisor, with crosvm as the virtual machine manager. Google is using this for a fairly obscure purpose (isolated compilation), but devs have figured out how to [boot Linux and even Windows VMs](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-dessert-bites-13-virtualization-on-pixel-6-379185\/). You'll need a device that supports pKVM, though. 39. [**Camera2 improvements**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_improvements). Camera2 is the underlying API used by camera apps, and it's getting some welcome additions in Android 13. First, it has added [HDR video capture support](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#camera2_hdr_video), so third-party camera apps can finally capture HDR video, provided the OEM exposed support for this in the camera HAL. There's a new API for preview stabilization, and viewfinder jitter has been reduced as well. These are more developer-focused improvements, but I thought you should be aware of them in case you use a third-party camera app.40. [**Faster hyphenation**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#faster_hyphenation). Text wrapping will be better in Android 13, as many apps will insert hyphens at the end of a line in a text field. Hyphenation seems like a simple matter, but before Android 13, it was [quite taxing on the CPU](https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-VOBIuEkWNSA\/XR0jIcKZXTI\/AAAAAAAAJi0\/jwoi5z0mZOUKjviFfMZJlIBddHvsaZm1ACLcBGAs\/s1600\/image1.png). Android 13 improves hyphenation performance by as much as 200%.41. [**Improved Japanese text wrapping**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#japanese_text_wrapping). Apps that support Japanese can now wrap text by \"Bunsetsu\", which is the smallest unit of words that's coherent, instead of by character. This will make text more readable by Japanese users.42. [**Improved line heights for non-Latin scripts**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#improved_line_heights_non_latin). Android 13 improves support for non-Latin scripts like Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Tibetan. The OS uses a line height that's adapted for each language, preventing clipping and improving the positioning of characters.43. [**MIDI 2.0 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#midi_2_0). MIDI 2.0 was introduced in late 2020 and adds bi-directionality so devices can communicate with each other to auto-configure themselves or exchance info on available functionality. It also makes controllers easier to use and adds 32-bit resolution support.44. [**DNS-over-HTTP\/3 support**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dns_over_https). Android 9 added encrypted DNS (ie. Private DNS) support through the DNS-over-TLS protocol. Android 13 adds support for the DNS-over-HTTP\/3 protocol. This implementation offers better performance and security. Right now, Android's DNS-over-HTTP\/3 implementation only allows using Google and Cloudflare as providers. This feature has been backported to all GMS Android devices running Android 11-12L and some Android 10 devices.45. [**Android's Bluetooth stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#bluetooth_module). Bluetooth vulnerabilities are pretty common, so in an effort to improve security, Android 13 turns Android's Bluetooth stack into an updatable Project Mainline module. This means it can be updated through Google Play like other modular system components. However, I'm not sure if this module will be mandatory yet for OEMs.46. [**Android's ultra-wideband stack becomes a Mainline module**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#uwb_module). In a similar vein, Android's ultra-wide band stack that was just introduced in Android 12 has been turned into a modular system component in Android 13. There aren't many devices yet with UWB hardware, but with this + the new [UWB Jetpack library](https:\/\/developer.android.com\/jetpack\/androidx\/releases\/core-uwb), we should start seeing more apps make use of this hardware and Google expand UWB functionality in Android outside of OS updates.47. [**Binary transparency**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#binary_transparency). If you care about security, then you may be curious whether or not the binaries installed on your device match what's included in the official factory images. Android 13's binary transparency manager lets you easily get the VBMeta digest and build fingerprints of the partitions and modules on your device, so you can compare them with the official images. Note that while Google's the only one doing this so far (AFAIK), there's nothing preventing other OEMs from publishing their own transparency logs.48. [**Dynamic System Updates become a lot faster**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#dsu_improvements). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) makes it easy to install a Generic System Image (GSI) without overwriting your device's original installation or wiping your data. All you have to do is send an intent or just go to Developer Options to install one of Google's official GSIs through the \"DSU Loader\" setting. Android 13 makes GSI installation through DSU faster and more interactive.49. [**ART improvements bring lower memory use and faster runtime performance**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#art_updates). An update to the Android Runtime (ART) module will introduce a new garbage collection algorithm based on Linux's userfaultd feature, which may reduce the chance of the OS killing off background processes.50. [**Wallpaper dimming**](https:\/\/blog.esper.io\/android-13-deep-dive\/#cinematic_wallpapers).

The firm\u2019s name is Girard Gibbs and they are actively investigating this case and would like to hear from others that are experiencing problems with warranty service from Motorola. If you want to contact the firm, send an email to: eyn@girardgibbs.com.**   Very briefly I will relate my interactions with Motorola over the past 2 months and try to keep it from being my personal story.  This is not a thread about one person complaining about the customer service they received.  But the ordeal I am going through with Motorola in order to execute a simple limited-warranty exchange lead me to discover a much bigger issue.Motorola simply can't honor the warranty on their devices because they don't have replacement devices in stock.   I know for a fact that they have had no stock of the Moto G 3rd Gen, The Moto X Pure Edition and the Moto 360 and probably other devices for at least the past two months (I was directly told this by someone of 'Executive' status in the company).  But from all the other complaints I found on Moto forums, reddit and various other sites, it's apparent that this has been an ongoing issue for a while now but has become very problematic since January.  Coincidentally, it was announced in January 2016 that the name \"Motorola\" would no longer be used for the public, i.e. Lenovo is phasing out the brand names Moto and Motorola.I have an in-warranty Moto G 3rd gen that started malfunctioning to the point of it being hit-or-miss if it will work.  Two months ago I was authorized for an Advanced exchange to get the device replaced. [The program says it takes a maximum of 4 business days + shipping time](https:\/\/motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com\/app\/answers\/detail\/a_id\/63591\/~\/advance-exchange-program) for the replacement to arrive.  Weeks passed with no communication from Moto, I had to hound them over and over to find out what the status with my case and was and eventually found out they had no stock of Moto Gs for warranty exchange.  They tried to look for similar devices (The Moto X Pure Edition) and they were out of stock of that too.  And after some searching, the same is true for the Moto 360 as well.  Here are some quotes with their sources:  * https:\/\/www.consumeraffairs.com\/cell_phones\/motorola.html - Read a few, skim the rest but no need to go beyond the first page.  You get the idea pretty quick.  * [I sent in my black, metal band Moto 360 (1st gen) to Motorola over a month ago when it stopped powering on. They received it and I didn't get an update for 1 month so I called them and they said they are out of stock but they could offer me the champagne colored watch - I refused since I would've bought that color originally if it was what I wanted. Anyways, they said to wait 2 days to see if they get more in stock - I waited 11 days (I was very patient) and called today and they said they still don't have any in stock.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/moto360\/comments\/3r76ik\/motorola_not_honoring_warranty_because_they_are\/)  * [Three months after purchase, phone stopped working entirely (no water or physical damage). Sent it in and was promised to receive a new phone within 5 days. 10 days later, I called their support line to ask about the delay. They said it would take another 7-10 business days. Today, after an additional week, I called to inquire, and another rep told me it would arrive in two weeks. Worst service I have ever experienced. This is my third Motorola phone over five years, and after this experience, I will never buy a Motorola product again. Still waiting for my phone. 4\/4\/16](http:\/\/www.customerservicescoreboard.com\/Motorola)  This link has a ton of other people reporting similar issues.  * [Today (4\/11\/2016), I called the RE Team again to get an update, and happened to reach Marlin again. He had nothing to update me with because the status was still the same: there were no replacement phones available at the wharehouse. He apologized several times, and understood why I was upset. Then I asked him if replacement phones haven't been available for a month, and customers are out there waiting for a replacements, why not give them a new phone. **His response was that the team wants to do something like this, but Corporate has told them no discounts of any kind are to be offered and no new phones are to be offered.**](https:\/\/forums.lenovo.com\/t5\/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style\/Moto-X-Pure-Repair-Replacement-Limbo\/td-p\/3305032)  Scroll through the rest of the [Moto X forums](https:\/\/forums.lenovo.com\/t5\/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style\/bd-p\/449) and check out the other device forums as well.  You'll see complaint after complaint of people waiting weeks\/months for Moto to get stock of their particular device to fulfill their warranty exchange.  * [During this entire span of about 1.5 months, I was forced to go buy a temporary phone. Not only that, but Motorola charged me the full price of the replacement since they haven't received the original defective phone. I've spent hours & hours on the phone and via email with support and they've been rude, forgettful and unaccomodating. In fact, this is by far the worst support experience I've had with any company in my lifetime. After looking through Better Business Bureau reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who has gone through this.  Any ideas on ways I can finally resolve this issue? I'm tempted just to bring my lawyer in or submit an inquiry to some consumer watchdog groups.  Thanks!](https:\/\/forums.lenovo.com\/t5\/Moto-X-Pure-Moto-X-Style\/Help-Stuck-in-two-month-support-purgatory-amp-they-keep-sending\/m-p\/3306689#M12722)There's a plethora of evidence out there showing Motorola's unwillingness to keep the legal promises made in their limited warranty.  If you need to use your warranty, be prepared to spend hours on the phone and weeks of waiting.  You can call them and speak to supervisors and get your case escalated but you'll only end up listening to same lines repeated over and over - \"sorry we're still out of stock all we can do is wait for stock then we'll ship your replacement\" (which will be a refurbished phone).   Threatening legal action or contacting consumer advocacy groups seems to occasionally produce results from peoples' testimonials.  That or leveraging social media to your advantage.  BTW I'm not writing this in the hope it will personally help me with my issue.  I'm writing this so Motorola device owner's will know that the 12 month limited warranty that came with their device is virtually meaningless.  And I'm hoping this post gains attention so more people are aware of Motorola's practices.  I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say if their practices and policies are illegal or not, (in my opinion immoral, but that doesn't mean anything) but from the research I did there are state and federal laws designed to protect the consumer and ensure the warranter honors the agreement.  On the Federal level there is the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act](https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law) and the laws will vary state to state.  So hopefully I got my point across.  This isn't a call to action.  This isn't a person complaining about their customer experience.  The primary purpose of this post is to serve as a warning to \/r\/Android (and any other sub I xpost to) of what to expect when dealing with Motorola's warranty service and to facilitate discussion about recent experiences with Motorola's warranty service, even if it's contrary to my experience and all my citations.  Are they intentionally doing this?  Is it just a shortage of inventory due to change in ownership and facilities?  What do people think?And I must confess, I have a secondary purpose for writing this.  it is the small hope that this post will gain attention and affect some type of change. Thanks for reading.Oh and here's the actual warranty:  [Motorola's Moto G 3rd Gen Warranty](https:\/\/motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com\/ci\/fattach\/get\/797995\/1391012650\/redirect\/1\/filename\/Global%20Limited%20Warranty10-3-13-1.pdf)  >  2.  If  the  Product is  still  not  functioning  properly  after  you  have  followed  troubleshooting  instructions suggested  on this website,  please  contact Motorola using  the  contact  details  provided  on  the  customer support website at **[insert url]**.  Gotta love that attention to detail in a legally binding document.**Edit #1**: it's interesting how many of you are bringing up Lenovo and their reputation for having terrible customer support, especially when it comes to warranties and repairs. I actually had just as negative of an experience with Lenovo regarding a laptop, and as a result I will never spend another dollar with Lenovo.  The thing I find funny was that I had to send my laptop to Lenovo for repair in Fort Worth Texas. Well guess where Motorola's repair and warranty center is now? Fort Worth Texas. And not to get too personal, the laptop I received back was completely non-functional, as in if you had pressed the power button you would have seen it didn't even turn on.  And in my links above you will see plenty of people complaining about sending their phones to Fort Worth for repairs and getting non-functioning phones back.  I recall one person talking about their Moto G no longer getting a signal, so he sent it there for repairs and when he got it back they had replaced the power button on the phone.Capitalism is like democracy, you vote with your dollar. If you don't like the way a company does business then don't \"vote\" for them.  **Edit #2**: Looks like a news site picked up on this thread.  *  http:\/\/www.phonearena.com\/news\/Customers-report-Motorola-support-doesnt-honor-warranties_id80263  *  http:\/\/www.droid-life.com\/2016\/04\/15\/motorola-warranty-customer-service-disaster\/  *  http:\/\/www.androidheadlines.com\/2016\/04\/reports-motorola-not-honoring-warranties-increase.html    *  http:\/\/pocketnow.com\/2016\/04\/15\/motorola-warranty-service  *  http:\/\/thedroidguy.com\/2016\/04\/motorola-supposedly-denying-several-warranty-claims-1058349  * http:\/\/www.trustedreviews.com\/news\/motorola-warranty-broken-phone-no-more-stockI only hope more do the same!  Thanks Paul K.  Maybe if a few news sites pick up on this and contact Motorola, we will actually see some change in their behavior.  If any more sites do an article on this, I'll add the links to the OP to keep people updated.  Also thank you to everyone who posted their stories, I had no idea there were this many disenfranchised customers who have shared a similar experience to mine.","599":"I used Android exclusively since the T-Mobile G1. Since then, I always got the latest Android phones. That includes notable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Note 7. The Motorola Atrix. The Moto X. The Nexus 1, 4, 5, 6. Then finally the Pixel series starting with the 1, 2, 3, and now the 4.Last month I had an itching to try something new in quarantine, so I switched from my Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 Pro. There was initially a lot to like (build quality and screen mainly), but there were so many annoying quirks that I could not stand it for more than a month.If I could sum up my experience with the iPhone in one sentence, it would be \"Fantastic hardware, horrendous software\". iOS needs a ton of work in my opinion. Below is a recap of my issues with iOS:&#x200B;* Notifications are a mess   * Why are there two notification screens? \"Lockscreen\" and \"Notification center\". So many times I would think I've dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.   * It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.   * You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.   * If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn't dismiss it from your notifications. I've already read it, why is it still in my notifications?   * The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping \"by app\" in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc* Gestures   * You can only go \"back\" by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.   * There is no dedicated \"back\" button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to \"swipe away\" this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.* Home screen layout   * Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it's such a pain in the ass. Why can't I hide apps or have an app drawer?   * You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.* Apps   * Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is \"voluntary bloatware\". I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc   * Can't set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit \"navigate\", and it opened Apple Maps. There's no way to change this behavior.   * Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.   * There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.* Keyboards   * I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.   * If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no \"slide typing\" functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?   * If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having \"2 apps for every app\" like I mentioned in the Apps section above.* Camera\/Photos   * The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow   * Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I've only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it's seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn't understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a \"live view\" of what the portrait shot will look like.   * Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there's no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let's start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.* Background processes   * It's 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don't understand why.* iMessage\/FaceTime   * FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I'm a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn't really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime's moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to \"reply to\" a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.&#x200B;The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won't or can't fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.","600":"I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the \"I hate Samsung\" train that is r\/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying \"it's sooo smooth!\"  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious \"Pure Android\" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. A noteworthy experience, but can it last?My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g\u0336i\u0336m\u0336m\u0336i\u0336c\u0336k\u0336 feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. Picasso once said \"Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.\" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but \"THE\" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, \"Smooth now, but give it a month or two...\" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it\u2019s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I\u2019m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don\u2019t kill off the headphone jack. Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased\/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

So here I am, returning the favour, for any other iPhone users who are looking at this thread thinking that they might also want to jump ship.#Out of the BoxSwitching on my shiny new Android phone (a Samsung Galaxy S7 - but this article should apply to any Android device running Marshmallow or Nougat) for the first time, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect after 7 years of Apple logos and forced stock apps\u2026After being greeted by a dull opening screen, and the option to plug my Google credentials in, I was left staring at my empty home screen, a Google search bar, a large clock and a weather widget. Almost everything else was hidden in the app drawer. It felt like like a place to hide bloatware - but there wasn\u2019t too much guff in there - although I wasn\u2019t about to start using ugly looking Samsung apps when there was a whole app store waiting to be clicked on.Luckily I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s services for years (I\u2019ve never liked iCloud), so my contacts, email, calendars and photos were synced, and my credit card was already hooked up. A quick setting change to get my fingerprint into the phone, and I would be ready to start my journey. So how did day one compare to my old iPhone? Starting up an iPhone for the first time is a much slicker experience - it feels more welcoming (much in the same way a Mac \u2018feels\u2019 more friendly than a PC) and there was a familiar collection of icons. These days though, those most of those Apple apps feel like crapware, and I rarely use Apple\u2019s stock apps. In fact my iPhone was gradually becoming a Google phone anyway (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, etc).So what else was different...#More ButtonsWith the single \u2018home\u2019 button on the iPhone (not counting the volume, power or mute switch), there isn\u2019t much to think about (double tap for app-switcher, hold for Siri). Suddenly there are 3 buttons, and muscle memory made it hard to not keep launching the camera when switching apps (ok - this is a Samsung feature - double tap home to launch camera - it\u2019s really useful). However, having a dedicated \u2018back\u2019 button has proved really useful - the \u2018slide from the left to go back\u2019 that Apple has pushed as the standard for \u2018back\u2019, didn\u2019t work with every app, and if you were thrown from one app to another, you had to stretch your fingers to the very top left of the phone to jump back (Note: the Android \u2018back\u2019 button has occasionally confused me, and thrown me out of apps). Switching between apps on Android is also simple (I\u2019m looking forward to Android 7.0 where I can quickly double tap to jump between the previous\/current app). Having a few extra options for navigating around the phone is really quite good.#Voice - Siri vs OK GoogleI quite liked Siri - she didn\u2019t do much, but she was quite funny.However OK-Google is utterly amazing. From being able to ask a song to be played on Spotify (which will likely never be an option on the iPhone), to dictating a reminder, rarely does Google get the speech-to-text wrong (Siri always seemed to write things on a word-by-word basis, but Google seems to look at the whole sentence and change things accordingly). I\u2019m really impressed, and actually use the voice feature now that I feel it is going to be correct more often than not.The other advantage with the dictation on Android is the ability to click a word and be given the options of other words that you \u2018might\u2019 have said - this makes text editing super quick, without feeling like you need to delete stuff and start again.#LEDsLittle flashing lights on my phone. It\u2019s quite handy seeing it blink away at me, without the whole phone springing to life and lighting up the place.#App EquivalentsThis was the biggest hurdle for me. I\u2019ve gone through a LOT of apps over the years (1256 according to my AppShopper account). Some have stayed on the phone for one launch, others have survived many cullings. But some of my most used and beloved apps just don\u2019t exist on Android. So after much MUCH research and testing, here is my list of equivalent apps (I should add, that it\u2019s really refreshing to be able to select your stock apps on Android): - Mail >> Gmail (or Inbox, Outlooks) - Facetime >> WhatsApp (Video Calling) (or Duo - but sadly I don\u2019t know many people using it - Messages >> Textra  - GBoard >> Google Keyboard (although it doesn\u2019t have Gif search - but it does let you use voice to type) (or Swype, Swiftkey) - Apple Maps >> Google Maps (which is by far superior on Android - with widgets and shortcuts) (or Waze) - Tweetbot >> Talon (or Flamingo, Fenix) - Narwhal (for Reddit) >> Sync (for Reddit) - Notes >> OneNote (or Google Keep, Evernote) - Reminders >>ToDoIst (or Google Reminders, Google Now, Inbox, Keep), Wunderlist)#Apps I Miss##WalletGreat for storing store cards, but most of the individual \u2018store card\u2019 apps seem to have a link to their cards anyway.##MessagesThose blue bubbles! You knew you were sending texts and photos without worrying about how they were going to be seen at the other end. WhatsApp is getting close in terms of features though, and the new video calling feature is great.Erm\u2026 that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve now got apps that shout at me when my battery is charged, or read texts when I\u2019m driving (Shouter Pro), apps that let me jump around to other apps (Swiftly Switch) and folder apps (Sold Explorer File Manager). There are even emulator apps for those old school games.#WidgetsThis leads me onto widgets. On iOS they are tucked into notification style boxes, but (for example) having a ToDoIst task list and my calendar widget on a home screen is much more useful. Throwing in shortcuts to a WhatsApp contact or a favourite Dropbox folder, is great (iOS has 3D touch for some shortcuts, but not all apps work with it). #Apps That iOS Will Never Have##NovaThis is the app that has sold me on Android. I can customise my phone to my heart\u2019s content. I\u2019ve been using similar apps for year - do I really need to have their names written on my phone? Just switch the names off! -  I have a massive screen, so do I really only want a small grid of apps? Just change the amount of apps you want along the horizontal and vertical! You can even resize widgets. - Would I like to position those apps into a more useful layout, change their icons (I\u2019ve even created my own custom designs), change the icon size, change how those icons function if I press or swipe on them? All possible with Nova. - Do I want to double tap the screen to text-message, swipe up to search, pinch to jump to voicemail? Yes\u2026 yes I do.OK, there are a LOT of options and even plugins (for things like adding the red notification dots on apps) - BUT the app is super easy to use, and I can\u2019t imagine using my phone without it (I love to tweak things).##Google NowAlthough there is an iOS version that does some of what \u2018Goolge Now\u2019 does on Android, it really doesn\u2019t work that well. On Android I\u2019m only a swipe away from seeing info about what\u2019s around me, stocks, news, weather, where my car\u2019s parked etc. When I went on holiday, it even pulled in my info about flights, hotels, and train links. ##Google Now On TapHold the home key and you can copy text from anywhere on the screen, or have Google act on what\u2019s on the screen. It feels a little gimmicky, but it can be occasionally useful.#Transferring filesThis almost made me take the phone back. I\u2019m used to just sticking a USB into my iPhone and having my Mac suck the photos from it, sync apps and backup. I\u2019d tried a friends Android and plugged it in, and photos and folders where just as easy to deal with. However, my Galaxy S7 just didn\u2019t want to play. After trying numerous apps and getting nowhere, I ended up using Dropbox to sync my photos in the background (which actually turned out great, as they are constantly backed-up now -see my notes on \u2018Background Multitasking).Then I discovered AirMore (I\u2019m now also trying AirDroid) - a couple of clicks, and I can essentially use my phone through my browser. Texting, screenshots, file transfer, folder search, notifications. It\u2019s slick, fast and allows really easy uploading and downloading of anything I throw at it (for example - Android is sensible enough to stick photos in the Gallery just from a quick drag & drop from the computer browser). #App StoreApple wins here - their AppStore is wonderful. Apps seem to be released first on iOS, and there is a greater proportion of solid, slick looking apps and games (my guess is that piracy rates are high and profits are low on Android). The Google Play Store is getting better though - there have been quite a few slick upgrades in just the last few weeks. One big advantage is being able to buy and install apps from your browser (so if I read a good review on my laptop, I can have the app on my phone in a couple of clicks). Also, if the app is not what you hoped, you can get a refund if you go back to the store quickly enough (2 hours I think). However, there are a LOT of poor apps on the store - for example, there may be dozens of texting apps that can become your stock app, but most look like they were designed by some tin-pot hacker looking to jump into your phone and suck its data dry. #Background multitaskingThe classic battery killer - but I\u2019m not finding any apps that churn away at my battery (I ditched the official Facebook app very early on, and moved to \u2018Swipe Pro\u2019 - another recommendation).There are some big advantages to having things run in the background though - my Dropbox happily uploads photos as soon as I\u2019m on Wifi (Dropbox on iOS would stop as soon as the app was in the background). Apps that I want to sync while I\u2019m not watching them are doing their thing, and the info I want it waiting for me (having apps stop working in the background if I\u2019ve not used them for a few days is great as well - as I have a tendency to get excited by new apps, and then forget to use them).#Fingerprint SensorThe sensor works just as well on my Galaxy S7 as it did on my iPhone (although the iPhone would recognise my print even if the phone was the upside-down, which the S7 doesn\u2019t ) - and more apps are starting to use it (thankfully my banking app does now, so typing in crazy long passwords isn\u2019t such an issue now).Throw in 1Password\u2019s keyboard and it only takes a quick fingerprint unlock to put my password into any app or website.#NotificationsI\u2019ve never really felt happy with iOS notifications - they weren\u2019t easily dismissed, some had more info than others, and once you\u2019d looked at them, they were gone from your screen (until you hunted around for the little red numbered dots all over the place, reminding you of how many things you\u2019ve missed). Android gets it right - a quick swipe down and the notifications are there for you to act on. Swipe them back up to see them later , or swipe them to the side to clear them away. I really don\u2019t miss those red dots nagging at me, and I love the more varied way of being able to interact with notifications (my bank app reminds me I\u2019m signed in, and includes a button to sign-out right in the notification bar, Spotify is there with what is playing, or reminders can be snoozed for later). You can also set whether you want the notification to show just the app name, or more info, on an app-by-app basis.#Anything Else?##ProsI stuck in a 128Gb memory card - so offline music and photos are never an issue anymore.##ConsSlow updating to the lastest Android OS - it looks like I\u2019m going to have to wait a few more months until Nougat hits my phone. But if you are going to get a Google Pixel, this won\u2019t be a problem.#ConclusionOn the whole, there isn\u2019t really all that much different about my day-to-day using of Android vs iOS. I still use a Mac and an iPad, and everything plays nicely together. But I do love the shortcuts, customisation of look and feel, and all the tweaking of gestures (via Nova). It feels like *MY* phone, instead of looking like everyone else\u2019s, and has become a good new friend in my pocket.Would I recommend Android? Well\u2026 I still think an average user would get along better with an iPhone - the whole package just works; they back themselves up and never really change much.However, I love to play with my gadgets and iOS was just starting to bore me. It was a really hard decision to jump platforms, but I\u2019m really pleased I did. I feel equally at home on either platform, but I\u2019m really happy to be on Android.Edit: formatting listsEdit 2:Wow. That's a lot of comments so far - and virtually all of them are helpful or inquisitive. I love this subreddit! **What I should add to my review based on feedback:** - Everyone should get Tasker.  - Two apps can be opened at once (a GS7 feature on Android 6, but open to all on Android 7). - No Android Pay in Canada. - No working version of Samsung Pay in Canada. - People really love a lot of different Reddit apps! - This review was really about the OS - there are too many phones and features - love the phone you have. - I've tried every tip to get my phone to be seen by my Mac, and  only Android Transfer worked (but it's a bit underwhelming). However, AirMore and AirDroid still seem like the best options for me (looking into 'Join' and 'PushBullet' though). 'Commander One' for Mac looks interesting too. - Set up a Nova gesture to easily get to Google Now (mine is now swipe up from app drawer) - Saying \"OK Google - Lumos\" and \"OK Google - Nox\" was the funniest tip I received (thanks \/user\/0x6A7232)!Edit 3 & 4: formatting lists (as Markdown suddenly doesn't seem to be working for me!)Edit 5: I've got a screenshot of my new homescreen with apps based on everyones feedback.

[One article](https:\/\/habr.com\/en\/post\/456182\/) says that at least in 2014, there was a $6,000 one-time payment and ~$1 per-device fee for batches of up to 10k devices. That info came from Silicon Laboratories, a fabless semiconductor firm that designs many Bluetooth products.  The Wikipedia article on aptX, before my edit, falsely claimed that the aptX & aptX HD encoders were added to AOSP in Android 10 and could be freely used by OEMs. That was NOT true at the time. The claim was added in December 2019 but was a misreading of an *AndroidAuthority* article on BT codecs.What is true is that since Android 8.0, the Bluetooth A2DP stack added support for loading AAC, aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC codecs IF they were present in the build. As noted in the [AOSP docs](https:\/\/source.android.com\/docs\/core\/connect\/bluetooth\/services#implementation), \"device manufacturers may need to obtain separate licenses and binary blobs for some proprietary audio codecs.\" This is where I fell down a rabbit hole of licensing and patents. AAC isn't free? LDAC needs certification? Etc. I'm done with that rabbit hole. I even briefly tried using ChatGPT to help me draft some of this article, but the tone\/voice just didn't feel right to me, lol.Anyway, when it comes to aptX\/HD, OEMs would obtain encoders compatible with AOSP right from Qualcomm.For example, on Pixel phones prior to Android 13 QPR2, you could find precompiled aptX and aptX HD encoders as shared libraries in \/system_ext\/lib64. Starting in Android 13 QPR2, those shared libraries are no longer there, as they are compiled statically into the Bluetooth APEX.I believe that going forward, any OEM that ships the Bluetooth APEX in their AOSP-based project will have the aptX and aptX HD encoders available in their end product by default. There is even a [new MTS test](https:\/\/android-review.googlesource.com\/c\/platform\/test\/mts\/+\/2298682) (Mainline Test Suite) for this.  Of course, just because there is source code for something doesn't make it open source. That depends on the license. To clarify this, I reached out directly to Qualcomm a few months back, and got the following statement (for context, in early November 2022):>\"We made the decision a few months back to include the encoders for classic aptX and aptX HD in the Android Open Source Project. The technology is known the world over as THE superior audio codec for wireless BT audio, and we have worked closely with both Google and individual OEM\u2019s over the years to include these codecs in Android-based products. We are excited to say that under license from Qualcomm, these encoders are indeed now available under AOSP pursuant to the CLA\u2019s in place. >As aptX codecs continue to be the leader in delivering superior audio quality, and with our introduction of Snapdragon Sound in March 2021, Qualcomm is committed to ensuring we deliver premium audio experiences, the lowest possible latencies, and the best connectivity solutions available. As per our usual business processes, the licensing of aptX, Snapdragon Sound and the underlying technologies, will continue to remain unchanged apart from contributing the aptX and aptX HD encoders to AOSP.\"And just to be extra extra sure, I asked Qualcomm to explicitly name the license and what products are covered:  >\"There are inbound and outbound licenses to the project of course.  Once officially approved by Google - which we expect in the coming days since these were just recently submitted -  the encoders will be offered under the outbound AOSP (Apache) license.\u201d>\"The purpose of the contribution is to enable people to distribute the encoders as part of their finished products. The only Qualcomm products included in this release for Android are aptX and aptX HD ENCODERS. All other aptX products require a license direct from Qualcomm.\"So there you go, you no longer need to go through Qualcomm if you want to include an aptX and\/or aptX HD encoder in your ANDROID product, so long as you utilize the code in AOSP licensed under Apache v2.0.This is great news for hobbyist custom ROM developers as well, as previously they'd have to just rip the shared libraries from a precompiled build (with questionable legality). Now you can just compile them from AOSP sources.And yes, they do [work as shared libraries](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hmtheboy154\/status\/1584408081626443776) if you change the blueprint to compile them as such. Here's the source code in AOSP if you're interested: [Encoder for aptX](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/packages\/modules\/Bluetooth\/+\/refs\/heads\/master\/system\/embdrv\/encoder_for_aptx\/) | [Encoder for aptX High Definition](https:\/\/android.googlesource.com\/platform\/packages\/modules\/Bluetooth\/+\/refs\/heads\/master\/system\/embdrv\/encoder_for_aptxhd\/)  Since I know most of you have devices that support aptX and aptX HD already, you're wondering why you should care. Well, for most users, this doesn't matter. It's a change that affects OEMs for the most part. Surprisingly there are some devices that don't have either aptX or aptX HD, though. My NVIDIA SHIELD TV, for example, only supports aptX but not aptX HD.","603":"I was able to drop by [Google\u2019s Nexus Open Studio Event in New York City](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/3w34pc\/google_is_running_an_open_nexus_event_in_nyc\/) and it was a terrific, intimate event. There were neat little [Android Experiments](https:\/\/www.androidexperiments.com\/), [demos, sticker printers](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=Nexusstudio), [and sample devices](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/nexusstudio\/). And even better, there were representatives from seemingly all of the disciplines at Google involved with the new Nexus phones: Android UX design, software product managers for Nexus, Nexus industrial design, Nexus hardware engineering, and others. And they were all super friendly and surprisingly open to answering all kinds of questions, from the mundane to controversial. In the end, whether or not we might agree or disagree with their product and design decisions, I came away with a clear picture of how passionate and thoughtful the folks at Google are. Apologies for the dreadfully long post, but I wanted to share some of my experiences and the really interesting things I learned chatting with the Google staff about Nexus, Android, and technology.Before diving in, I just want to caveat here that these are merely my recollections (sorted by theme and not chronology) and were the product of casual conversations with lots of Google folks. So, each answer is often a mix of multiple people's perspectives, including my own. Please don't take this information as gospel and please forgive me if there are some inaccuracies or misinterpretations. Also any \"quotes\" I've included are for effect and are my best attempt to remember some of the really impactful or interesting tidbits I learned; I tried to honestly paraphrase and should not be read as verbatim quotes.**tl;dr: The Nexus Open Studio event was fantastic. Many people from the Nexus and Android teams were there and were incredibly friendly and open to engaging conversation. If you love learning about the small stories on Android\/Nexus development and Google, there is some really awesome stuff below like answers to the Nexus 6P display generation and more.**----------# ...On the development\/design timeline of the Nexus 5X\/6P:I learned that the design and development of a smartphone typically takes around two years. For the Nexus 5X and 6P?  ....a grueling **seven** months.# ...On the industrial design of the Nexus 5X:A lot of work went into the curvature and radius of the edges of the 5X and the camera \"hump\". The industrial designers ensured that each of the Nexus 5X's curves utilized \"C3\" continuous surfacing. It's a lot of work for a small detail, but offers significant rewards in terms of light play around the surface and how naturally\/organically the surface curves. (I admit this is all I was able to understand!)# ...On the engineering challenges to nail the industrial design of the Nexus 6P:I had personally naively assumed that since Nexus phones tended to be based off hardware designs of existing phones (the Nexus 4 and LG Optimus G, the Nexus 5 and the LG G2, etc.) that Google would be merely using established, solved industrial design processes that were well known by the manufacturing partner. It was interesting to find out that a lot of experimentation and testing still went into things like the bead blasting process and the diamond-cut chamfer.I had imagined that much like going to a paint store and picking from a huge wall of swatches, that the colors and finishes were a known and well-established thing for a manufacturing partner\u2014they just merely needed to be selected. However, even something like the media used in the bead blasting process still needed constant testing and refinement. The Nexus engineers and designers tried a variety of media like coconut shells, glass beads\u2014> *\"We spent lots of time over in China pulling samples fresh off the bead blasting manufacturing line, running over to a window, and scrutinizing the way the light played off the surface.\"*All told, there were around 80 different manufacturing steps for the Nexus 6P (and fun fact: Google dictated that all of the aluminum leftovers in manufacturing were to be collected and reused\/recycled). In fact, the circumferential chamfer that wraps around the visor is actually an industry first, using a brand-new process. In addition there were other major challenges in terms of managing the RF with an all metal phone\u2014making sure antennas weren't detuned by the aluminium body through careful injection molding processes. # ...On the relationship between the Nexus manufacturing partner and Google:I was surprised to learn that the manufacturing partner relationship can be a mixed bag and even depends on the partner (see next topic). Even with the latest Nexus 5X and 6P where Google exercised a considerable amount of design influence, there was a give and take between the manufacturing partner and Google. Oftentimes there was pushback from the partner for the sake engineering or manufacturing convenience\u2014one designer mentioned that it was three-months of back and forth *just* to get the USB Type-C connector centered on the bottom of the 6P. Another had referred to the bottom of the recently announced HTC A9 as evidence of design by cost and engineering convenience. He was sympathetic though, as he recognized that for many of Google's OEM partners, the teams live and die by the success (or lack thereof) of a single product launch, and so cost (in both design and manufacturing) is a legitimate consideration. Google, however, can afford to take a longer view on cost and invest in trying to hit a higher bar of design. The relationship was a lot of work (one Google engineer spent about two of the seven month development time over in China overseeing things), but it seems like both the [manufacturing partners](http:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/huawei-exec-nexus-6p-dream-also-challenging-one?utm_source=ac&utm_medium=dlvrit) and Nexus engineers and designers were really happy with the end result.# ...On the Nexus family design language and the Motorola Nexus 6:Following up on this, I asked about the Nexus 6 and the manufacturing partner selected for that generation, Motorola. Its design seemed to share more with other phones in the Motorola family than it did with any other device in the Nexus family. > *\"...Somebody backed out at the last minute.\"*I didn't poke any further, but it was added that as a manufacturing partner, Motorola exercised tighter control over the design and engineering of the phone, in a way vastly different from other Nexus partners. It sounded like Google designers and engineers (obviously) preferred the more Google-directed partnership, so this may be the last we see of a Nexus 6-ish device with a design that deviates so much from the Nexus family language. (And you all can read between the lines there.)# ...On the lessons learned from the Nexus 6:The team there recognized and acknowledged a lot of the complaints\/problems of the Nexus 6. It was too big, too bulky, hard to use one handed, and worst of all\u2014> *\"...the Nexus 6 spun around when you tried to use it on a table.\"*Along with the fact that the Nexus 5 was Google's best selling Nexus phone, this seemed to set the stage for what we see with the Nexus 5X and 6P today. First, a return to the tried-and-true formula of the Nexus 5, but with updated hardware and a modernized design for 2015. On the Nexus 6P, there were obviously more design changes. For one thing, the screen shrinkage from 6\" to 5.7\" seems small, but vastly improved one-handed use. Also, they were proud that they were able to fit a 5.7\" size screen into a device with the same phone size as competitors with a smaller 5.5\" screen (clearly a reference to the iPhone 6 Plus). In addition, the visor was a key design component addition. For one thing, an all-metal frame did need RF windows for sensors, cellular reception, etc. But moreover, the full-width visor allowed for a stable base... and no more spinning phones on tables. \ud83d\ude04# ...On the just-barely \"off center\" placement of the camera module in the Nexus 6P visor:I really enjoyed this particular story of the design and engineering hurdles with the Nexus 6P: Astute owners of the Nexus 6P might notice that the [camera lens is just-oh-so-slightly above the center axis of the oval camera \"surround\"](http:\/\/forums.androidcentral.com\/attachments\/nexus-6p\/202819d1445644158t-nexus-6p-build-quality-rear-glass-visor-gap-google-nexus-6p-review-camera.jpg) it sits within. Well, it turns out it wasn't just some design oversight.Thanks to the all-aluminum design of the Nexus 6P, all of the RF (wireless) \"stuff\" and sensors needs to fit within either the visor or the bottom plastic RF \"windows\". This includes the [NFC sensor](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), which was even of a special design that allowed for a small part of the sensor to sit \"above the fold\" in the RF window, while the rest was below (check out the teardown photo and you'll see). When it came to QC test the NFC sensor in the Nexus 6P's first iteration... **it failed**. Not enough of the sensor had been exposed in the visor, and they had to painfully widen the visor just a little. Well, the camera had originally been symmetrically aligned in the visor, but when they widened it, the camera was now off center (and unable to be moved around anymore because of design and timing limitations). To help conceal the now slightly-off center nature of the camera within the visor, the design team threw in the oval camera surround.# ...On bucking the trend of thinner phones with smaller batteries:When discussing the Nexus 6P \"visor hump\", I mentioned that one of the frequent suggestions I've seen in terms of eliminating humps altogether was to just maintain thickness on a phone and use the added volume for more battery capacity. The engineer just shrugged and replied:> *\"Apple really sets the bar on thinness there.\"*# ...On the Nexus 6P and 5X placement of the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:The Nexus design team considered and spent a lot of time researching three different fingerprint sensor locations before settling on the rear placement we know today: the bottom front (e.g., Samsung\/iPhone), the side power button (e.g., Sony Xperia), and the center rear. Designers liked the discoverability and accessibility of the Samsung\/iPhone model, but felt that the bottom edge placement placed all the weight of the phone aft of the sensor and there was a cantilevering effect that was both awkward and increased the risk of dropping. The side positioning had limitations based upon the thinness of the phone and those limitations would reduce the surface area available to read a fingerprint. The backside approach allowed for a large surface area to capture a fingerprint, was where the index finger naturally fell, and also was suitable for both right and left-handed users. > *\"As you scale the phone, the fingerprint sensor does not move\u2014because it's not based on [the size of] the phone, it's based on the human hand.\"*The backside sensor approach also had the benefit of being scalable and independent of phone size, which was particularly relevant for the two-sized Nexus launch. It was pointed out that the fingerprint sensor was in an almost identical location on both the Nexus 5X and 6P, despite the differences in the size of the phones. The hardware engineer conceded that the industrial designers were so passionate about perfecting the fingerprint sensor location that...> *\"In fact, [the industrial designers] were so adamant about basing this on the human hand [we had to compromise on the battery size](https:\/\/d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net\/igi\/ZlpUoq3OjhHJsqTo.huge), to make sure he got his way\u2014**to make sure it fit the human hand.**\"*# ...On how Google tested and benchmarked the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor:Google wanted a quantitative way to measure the speed of the fingerprint sensor while they were optimizing its speed. So, Google engineers built a rig with a robot \"hand\" and highspeed camera for testing and benchmarking the fingerprint sensor. However, the missing link was what to use for the actual fleshy finger stand-in. > *\"The product manager for fingerprint... she was having lunch one day in the cafe and she was having chicken drumsticks. And she realized that the skin of the chicken drumstick is really similar to the human hand. So she took a batch of chicken drumsticks, took it upstairs to the lab, washed it, picked off a bit and tied it to the robot, and used that to measure the latency of the fingerprint sensor.\"*# ...On sourcing the new Sony camera module:The camera was clearly the major highlight of the event (other than the Nexus Imprint, both of which had key presentations), and many of the team I spoke with were incredibly proud of it. One product manager proudly noted that the sensor sourced was an industry-first and that it was pulled from Sony's digital camera parts bin (and not mobile camera menu).One of the things I learned from the team was that picking out a sensor is not merely just the picking of a sensor from a parts menu. In every implementation, Sony needs to attach a team to support the integration of the camera sensor. Sony was initially concerned that the sales volumes wouldn't be sufficient on the Nexus phones to be worth the investment for Google to reach so deep into their premium parts menu. It took a lot of convincing to get Sony onboard to provide Google this particular camera module. Thankfully it turns out Sony was really satisfied about the press and acclaim it received in connection with the new Nexus phones and their stellar camera.# ...On the absence of camera OIS:Sony did not offer this particular camera module with an OIS option.# ...On the Nexus 6P display, and whether it is a \u201ccurrent generation\u201d Samsung AMOLED display:> *\u201c...The Nexus 6P actually uses the same display panel as the Note 5\u201d*Knowing that this is a hot topic on \/r\/android, I brought up the fact that testing has shown that on the Nexus 6P, its display has a lower maximum brightness and higher display power consumption than seen on the Note 5\u2014key indicators of the AMOLED panel generation\u2014I received knowing acknowledgement. So it turns out that the display panel is the same, but that much like the practice of CPU\/SoC binning, there is variation inherent in AMOLED panel fabrication. Here, Google was able to procure the lower binned, yet current-generation displays from Samsung for the Nexus 6P. # ...On the thermals of the Snapdragon 810 SoC:The thermals of the Snapdragon 810 were known to Google and were of some concern. Qualcomm attached a team of engineers to help control thermals and supplied Google with a *third* version of the Snapdragon 810 (which when I got home, seems to match public, well-established reports that the Nexus 6P uses the v2.1 version of the 810).# ...On the removal of wireless charging from the Nexus 5X and 6P:It sounded like the intention to go with a never-been-done-before-on-Nexus all-aluminum design had a big role to play. The Qi wireless charging was not going to work on the metal back, and so it needed to be dropped. For the Nexus 5X, even though it had a plastic design, the product team consciously wanted to maintain a certain feature parity\/consistency between the two models (like in the same way they kept the same camera, flash, IR sensor, etc.) Furthermore, the reduced pain point of the universal direction USB Type C connector added onto the decision to drop wireless Qi charging.# ...On the Nexus 6P\"Bendgate\" controversy:All of the Nexus phones go through rigorous strength and wear testing. When the videos first broke out about the \"Nexus 6P Bendgate\", the engineers rushed back into the labs to double-check and rerun the tests to make sure they hadn't missed anything. The engineer I spoke with indicated that nearly all phones are strength tested to similar specifications and all have their first \"bend\" at a similar weight pressure\u2014he quoted the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6P to be around 40-45 kgs on the particular bending bench. Apparently, where phones vary is the ultimate failure strength (the amount of pressure for the phone to catastrophically fail after a first bend), but the pressure-to-first-bend was apparently consistent across most phones.# ...On the \"twist to launch\" camera action that was apparently pulled from the Nexus 6P:According to one product manager I spoke to about this, the feature didn't test well and was never formally implemented as opposed to being dropped\/pulled. It was an accident it was included on websites.# ...On controversial topics like internal storage and integrated batteries:I asked some of the product managers what they thought about the controversies over internal storage and integrated batteries\u2014particularly whether there was any truth to the theories that the limited internal storage was really an initiative to push users to cloud storage or that integrated batteries were there for planned obsolescence. The product managers were quite genuine and adamant that there were no ulterior motives and that things really boiled down to usability and design tradeoffs. On the internal storage side, they noted that this was an interesting and complex issue, and first pointed out that when they balance tradeoffs for a feature like expandable microSD storage, the same balance isn't made the same way for every market. For example, on Android One phones, the usability issues with microSD was outweighed by the need for price sensitivity and the greater challenges of single-up-front payment\u2014and this use case is reflected in the inclusion of microSD in Android One designs and in Marshmallow's stronger adoption of external storage. However, on the Nexus side, the usability issues with microSD won the day. The product managers were concerned about things like slower, poorer quality microSD cards and microSD failure that were challenging for users to self-diagnose when there were multiple kinds of storage. A single, high quality internal storage solved this issue (at the cost of expandability). They also noted that in addition to considering users, a single unified storage was easier and more predictable for developers\u2014a single fast and reliable internal storage meant better predictability on app performance, less problems with defining where to put files, and reduced troubleshooting\/customer service.We didn't get into the battery question as much, but the product managers noted that they really cared about the products they build. If they could have it their way, their phones would be timeless in a way similar to \"like a Gucci bag,\" with great longevity and resale value evidencing the quality of their product. So they too are disappointed with the inherent problems of lithium ion batteries. That said, the design benefits to an integrated battery were so great that the balance of tradeoffs really went in favor of non-removable batteries.Anyway, as a personal aside, I know these are really hot button topics on \/r\/android and for those folks that firmly sit on one side of the fence or the other, I'm not entirely sure any justification or rationale can be said that would be truly satisfying. I still hope this shed some additional light on the topic though!# ...On feedback on the Nexus products and Android UI:Everyone I spoke with was really open to hearing about feedback and even criticism. Many of them even browse \/r\/android and are well aware of the passionate \"feedback\" that users voice here. \ud83d\ude04 Some noted that they definitely have heard the requests for a smaller, more premium phone instead of the premium 6P phablet and economical 5X phone. They said they are always looking into the decisions around this and are always rethinking those decisions for the next generation.Another noted that in addition to the outside user feedback, they hear a lot of the same sentiment directly after the launch of a new feature or device. The engineers, designers, and other Googlers are a very vocal and strongly opinionated group and are frequently dogfooding and using their own products. I asked one of the UX designers what one of the most controversial things was that she had worked on\u2014she confessed that she worked on and helped to implement the [bolded hour digit in the Jelly Bean clock app](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/nexusae0_155.png). ...She noted with a smile that the reaction of Google staff on this change alone was swift and unequivocal.# ...On the functionality and evolution of Android volume control:A presentation was devoted to the user experience design and evolution of Android volume control from pre-Lollipop, to Lollipop, to Marshmallow and I also had an opportunity to chat with the UX designer on this. It would take too long to fully discuss each of the design decisions and cases they considered, but it was really neat to see the amount of user testing that went into this. I also gained a stronger appreciation of the challenges with something as superficially simple and innocent as \"volume control\"\u2014there are a serious amount of different permutations and use cases of alarms and volume control. These challenges were compounded by the fact that unlike many of Google's apps that are now decoupled from the OS and are updated routinely on the Play Store, volume control is still tightly woven into the OS. The UX team needs to finalize their decisions well before the launch of the OS and only has an annual window for which to make changes. # ...On the sale of Motorola to Lenovo:Google's OEM partners were really concerned that despite the firewalls between the two organizations, that there was too much threat that a Google-Motorola would turn into a fully vertical entity like Apple (or Microsoft today with its Surface tablets), squeezing out its partners in the Android ecosystem. When I asked why the OEM partners were okay with the Nexus program, it sounded like the Nexus sales were still quite relatively small compared to the bigger OEM players (Samsung, LG, etc.) and were not threatening. # ...On the Nexus 6P three-microphone noise cancellation:I thought I had seen on the [iFixit teardown](https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/Nexus+6P+Teardown\/51660) that two of the advertised \u201c3 microphones (2 front, 1 rear) with noise cancellation\u201d were located within each of the front-facing speaker grills, but wasn't sure given the risks of interference from the speakers. It turns out the microphones are in fact in the speaker grills, and that they can be spaced in a way that minimizes interference from the speakers.# ...On the rumors of the next iPhone to pull the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of the Lightning connector:> *\"If anyone can do it, it's Apple and Beats.\"*The engineer noted that we've been stuck with the same form factor and technology on the 3.5mm analog jack for decades and figuring out the placement of it is a consistent design challenge and design limitation. There are a lot of new design opportunities afforded by moving to a new connector and opportunities around digital audio output (headphones with audiophile DACs and amps instead of relying on those in your phone!) and although Google doesn't really have the leverage to initiate a change like this, Apple definitely does\u2014especially through its ownership of Beats.# ...On knowing the name of the next Android version:The dessert naming decision of the next version of Android is not known to most Googlers, even those in the Android UX design team. So they are as surprised as everyone else when the statue is finally unveiled. However, while they don't often know the what the *right* choice will be for a name, they often know what it *won't be*, so internal and code references to wordy names like \"Lemon Meringue Pie\" were placed with tongues firmly in cheeks. The team at Google also had a lot of fun when David Burke trolled the community with his [infamous \"milkshake\" watch stunt](http:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/2015\/05\/28\/io-2015-dave-burke-wears-android-wear-watch-with-a-picture-of-a-milkshake-on-it-during-io-presentation-internet-freaks-out\/).","604":"This started out as my own attempt to make sense of the wildly varying reviews and got a little out of hand - so apologies...**Display**The Verge: *\"Colors aren\u2019t as vibrant or appealing [as the iPad Air 2], the screen isn\u2019t laminated to the glass as on the iPad Air 2, and the backlight bleeds into the edges of the screen in unsightly ways.\"*Android Police: *\"it is very, very good... backlight bleed [is] only a tiny bit around the lower-right edge of the tablet, but it's not bad enough to really matter\"*Phone Arena: *\"the Nexus 9 might appear ordinary from a cursory look, but beyond that, it packs all of the rich essentials in giving it some strong visual qualities that we appreciate.\"*Engadget: *\"All told, the Nexus 9's LCD is really a good screen, just not an outstanding one. \"* Ars Technica: *\"Other than a lead in brightness, nothing made HTC's 8.9-inch screen look particularly better or worse than Apple's latest tablet.\"*Conclusion: the backlight bleed is either unsightly or not bad enough to matter, the screen is either worse than the iPad Air 2 or very similar but brighter, and overall it's either great or mediocre.**Sound**The Verge: *\"I wish every smartphone and tablet had the Nexus 9's speakers\"*Android Police: *\"The quality of the audio, though, isn't exactly mindblowing.

Android Police could probably do with actually running it down with standard usage, instead of running a bunch of benchmarks and then estimating from partial discharges. Only Ars specify a normalised brightness and run a benchmark.**Overall Conclusion:** the ridiculous inconsistency makes it pretty difficult to review these websites, although Ars Technica seem to make relatively sensible and evidenced claims (and tally up well with Anandtech's preliminary findings). My advice is to wait for the Anandtech review or until you can borrow a friend's for a while, because if you asked this lot the time of day you'd get four different answers and the fifth would start rambling about the Air 2's clock app.","605":"Hey Apple subreddit,I'm the developer of Apollo for Reddit, a Reddit app for iOS that the Apple community has been really kind to in the past. I wanted to keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing (not a lot of people seem to know but Apollo is my full-time job!) so I thought I'd make a post showing all the goodies in Apollo version 1.9.Download link: https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id979274575In a nutshell, Apollo is a Reddit app built from the ground up to be a first-class app for iOS. I didn't want just another cross-platform hybrid app that feels wonky, but an app built specifically to feel right at home on iOS and take advantage of all of its features. All while being super fast, clean, and very customizable, with a ton of awesome power features like a super-charged media viewer with GIF scrubbing, swipe gestures, slick comments view, smart rotation lock, and so much more. And free to use as long as you want (with the option to support for a few bucks).My mom also says it's great: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CStrRVr.jpg Plus over 100K 5-star reviews from not my mom!Oh, and there's a TestFlight signup at the bottom if you want to beta test the app, as well as details on the iOS 14 update to drop when iOS 14 does!Anyway, without further ado here's the changelog:## ChangelogApollo 1.9's a massive update to Apollo that's taken months and months to complete, but I'm really happy with the result, and it brings together a ton of ideas from the community to make Apollo even nicer to use. The update includes a variety of features around crossposts, flair, new app icons, translation, and quality of life improvements. Thanks to everyone who writes in via email or via the [ApolloApp subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp), your suggestions for what you want to see in Apollo help immensely and really motivate me to keep making Apollo better and better.Without further ado, here are the changes included in this 1.9 update to Apollo:### Crosspost ViewingCrossposting (taking an existing post and reposting it to a similar subreddit) has been a big part of Reddit for ages, but recently it became a full-fledged feature where you can see exactly which subreddit it came from, and quickly jump to the original post. Apollo now supports this fully, so you can see the interesting content of the post, but also quickly jump over to read the original discussion! Often it's like getting two interesting discussions in one!### CrosspostingSimilar to being able to view crossposts, you can also easily perform a crosspost if you want as well! Simply select the post you want to crosspost, write a title, select the subreddit to crosspost it to, and bam, you're off to the races.### Image FlairFlair is a little \u201ctag\u201d users can add to their usernames in subreddit, and some subreddits even allow small images\/icons to be added in addition to text, like the icon for your favorite sports team, or a character from your favorite TV show. Apollo now shows these beautifully!### Setting Your FlairIn addition to being able to view the flair as discussed in the previous item, you can now set your own flair! Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs so you can add a little personality to your comments, showing which language you\u2019re learning, your username in a video game the subreddit is about, your fitness goals, etc.### View Long FlairSome users set loooong flair, and as a result it can get off, which can be annoying when you\u2019re trying to figure out what it says. Well be annoyed no longer, for you can simply tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!### Find Posts with Same FlairIf the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs (say, being able to tag whether your question is about a certain character, or a certain topic), you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.    ### 5 (Yeah, Five!) New App Icons!This update has taken a ton of time to work on, and as a result I was slightly behind in including the Ultra icons I wanted to include, but as a result there's now a proper Icon Bonanza, with five new icons being included in this update. The first three are Ultra icons, all made by the same incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles, who I\u2019ve been a fan of for a long time. I love how these turned out, we have our beloved Apollo mascot reimagined as an angel, a devil, as well as a zany pilot, all in gorgeous, colorful iconography. But those three icons aren't all! Next up, we have a beautiful new Apollo icon representing the trans pride flag (originally created by Monica Helms), which came out really awesome and is a great addition. And last but not least, our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, makes his second appearance with the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon! I love this set of icons so much, it\u2019s going to be really hard to choose.### Easy Language TranslationReddit is home to a diverse set of communities that have a variety of fascinating conversations, but sometimes it\u2019s tricky to understand what\u2019s being said if the conversation is in a language you\u2019re not familiar with. Heck, you might even have no idea what the language is! Now Apollo will be able to detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! It is so handy, whether you\u2019re following a fascinating conversation or even trying to learn a new language.### Fast Subreddit SelectorWhether you\u2019re trying to add a single subreddit to a filter, or adding multiple subreddits at a time to a multireddit, Apollo is now even faster at doing these tasks, with an auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.### Total Collapsed Comments & Remembering Collapsed CommentsTwo handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation, which can be super handy for viewing a comment thread. The second thing, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!### New Settings, Filters Tweaks, Bug Fixes, and More!A bunch of awesome new settings have been added to Apollo, like being able to disable the auto-looping of videos with audio, or being able to make it so translation options always show up. Filtering is also even more powerful, with your filters being able to target flair and links as well (in addition to the title), and fixes a few filtering bugs. Apollo also now shows videos from Reddit\u2019s experimental 'RPAN' service, which is essentially a kind of live stream post that you can now view within Apollo. Of course there's a bunch of other small bug fixes around Apollo, from the occasional account accidentally signing out, to video bugs, to Apollo quitting in the background when it shouldn\u2019t, as well as a bunch of other small tweaks across the app to improve your quality of life while browsing!### Known Issues(To be fixed very shortly. Please let me know if you're on the iOS beta or a stable version because a lot of the issues are understandably only present on the iOS beta, but a fix for those will be out soon as well when iOS 14 drops)- In weird cicrcumstances you can get duplicated audio- When rotating device it can sometimes throw you up the feed- Some accounts with a lot of data can have a bit of lag when returning from background (if this happens to you please send me your logs, Settings tab > About > Logs)## TestFlight and iOS 14 BetaI've been working hard at an iOS 14 update with widgets, picture in picture video, a new photo picker, and much more, so if you're interested in beta testing that and providing your feedback\/bugs, that would be awesome! You can sign up here: https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/I6svnXDzAlso note that for this 1.9 update I'm testing a \"phased release\" feature in App Store Connect so it may take a few days to get out to everyone, but the TestFlight beta has it immediately if you're willing to endure some testing and providing feedback as well. :)If you have any ideas about future updates, suggestions, or just general questions I'm happy to answer as well. It sounds bullshitty but I genuinely do build Apollo with the community in mind and giving people the Reddit app of their dreams.\\- Christian","606":"And even if they were, it's not because of any lawsuit.This is in response to [a highly-upvoted post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/yl5dyj\/explanation_for_reduced_noise_cancellation_in\/) on r\/apple which claims that an ongoing dispute between Jawbone Technologies, LLC and Apple Inc is causing a deliberate reduction in the effectiveness of the active noise cancellation (ANC) in Airpods Max and Airpods Pro via firmware updates.It's the kind of [string on a corkboard](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/StringTheory) post that Reddit loves to upvote, full of intrigue and conspiracy, but its conclusions are not sound.1. The patents in question are [not related to noise cancellation](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9lRvFD4). They are for microphone arrays and voice recognition. Microphones are leveraged in active noise cancellation, but a firmware update does not change the microphones, and none of the patents describe the arrays being used for this purpose. Jawbone as a company was focused on *voice call clarity* and separating a voice from the background, and the patents reflect that.2. Despite being filed well after they came out, the lawsuit does not include the Airpods Max on the [list of accused products.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZypGG0l) The list is almost entirely phones, speakers and TVs with voice assistance, including those from Google, Amazon and Samsung. The majority of the products listed don't even have ANC. Clearly, the lawsuit is concerning the separation and detection of voice from background noise, not active noise cancellation. It's almost certainly why the voice call noise reduction feature was removed from the iPhone 12 onwards, but it has nothing to do with active noise cancellation in hi-fi products.3. [Adaptation](https:\/\/mindhacks.com\/2013\/08\/22\/the-deafening-silence\/) is the very straightforward phenomenon that easily explains why we perceive soft sounds to be louder after some time\u2014our brains get used to it. Fin.4. Accusations of reduced ANC due to firmware updates are commonplace and happen to virtually all manufacturers of ANC products. It [happened with Bose headphones](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/mobile\/bose-investigates-mysterious-quietcomfort-35-firmware-issue\/) in 2017, who investigated and found [no reduction in performance](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home-theater\/bose-qc35-firmware-anc-damage-rollback\/). And despite that, [people still swear Bose is messing with it in 2022.](https:\/\/thedroidguy.com\/bose-quietcomfort-ii-firmware-update-worsens-noise-cancelling-1106611) You can find [posts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SonyHeadphones\/comments\/xjdggo\/noise_cancelling_wf1000xm4_issues_after_update_92\/) making the [same complaint](https:\/\/community.sony.co.uk\/t5\/portable-audio\/wh-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-performance-ruined-by-v4-1-1-firmware\/td-p\/2592166) for Sony heaphones too. The fact is, humans are clearly very poor objective judges of noise cancellation. ANC headphones require multiple things to work well\u2014active circuitry, clean microphones, and good passive isolation. It's easy for any one of these to be affected, and when they are, or if the environment itself gets louder, or if nothing changes and we've simply adapted to the new baseline noise level, firmware gets blamed.5. In fact, accusations of reduced ANC in the Airpods Pro [actually first happened in 2019](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/1\/17\/21069953\/apple-airpods-pro-noise-cancellation-problems-firmware-2b588-2c54), then [again in 2020](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/251909973), but the post doesn't include this in their timeline\u2014because that wouldn't corroborate the narrative that the lawsuit, filed in 2021, is to blame. There's between 1 to 2 million Airpods Max being used today. A thousand complaining on the internet about ANC performance is about what you would expect from a placebo or other effect, and not what you would expect from widely degraded product performance. A small subset of users are always experiencing reduced ANC due to poor fit or other reasons, and blaming it on firmware, because how else could the product have changed overnight?6. A design flaw causes reduced ANC over time in the Gen 1 Airpods Pro and is likely the culprit for lots of these ANC-related complaints. Sebum and dead skin cells clog the microphone grilles and reduce effectiveness. The grilles can really only effectively be cleaned by dabbing them with blu-tack to pull out the dirt. It can't be overstated how prolific this problem is: if you own Gen 1 Airpods Pro and have never cleaned them with blu-tack, you *are* experiencing reduced ANC performance. Apple should be transparent about this problem, but it's understandable why they won't say anything, for fear of causing Antennagate-like \"you're holding it wrong\" mockery. But, the problem exists, and RTINGS makes no mention of whether they've properly maintained their Airpods using this technique when retesting their old pairs. This design flaw was supposedly fixed in Gen 2. But it's led a lot of Pro owners, and RTINGS, to think that Apple has been reducing the ANC purposefully via firmware.7. In regards to the Airpods Max, RTINGS is the only site that has ever documented any measurable data about the ANC, but their test methodologies are not sound. In the latest test of the Airpods Max, you can clearly see in the [current test](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/headphones\/1-5\/graph#16092\/7981) compared to the [previous test](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/assets\/pages\/Ur5io1Sj\/airpods-max-noise-isolation-firmware-3b71-small.jpg) that the baseline \"ANC off\" line is about +10dB higher in the bass frequencies\u2014these lines should be similar since the ANC is OFF, but the difference would *exactly* explain the results due to leakage around the earpads.TL;DR - The lawsuit doesn't concern ANC in hifi products, the patents are for separating voices from background noise during calls and for detecting voice commands; Airpods Max aren't even on the list. There is a long history of blaming firmware updates for reduced ANC in headphones from all companies, due to the fact that ANC is a fragile system that can be impaired for many reasons that are not obvious to the user.EDIT: I should also add additional evidence that RTINGS methodologies are flawed. In 2019, they [tested the Bose QC35](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/headphones\/reviews\/bose\/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-wireless-2018) and concluded that new firmware had in fact degraded ANC. But Bose commissioned [their own wildly extensive investigation](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200410064938mp_\/https:\/\/community.bose.com\/t5\/Around-On-Ear-Headphones\/Bose-QC-35-Firmware-4-5-2-Noise-Cancellation-Investigation\/td-p\/285738#inconclusion)\u2014which included such incredible lengths as *visiting customer's homes and testing their headphones in-situ* as well as commissioning a 3rd party to conduct their own investigation\u2014and found *no* evidence of firmware degrading ANC. They did, however, link the cause to headphone cushions that were in poor condition, dislodged, or aftermarket. And yet, RTINGS maintains that firmware is to blame. It's the clearest example yet of a sizable portion of customers\u2014enough to get Bose's attention\u2014making claims about degraded ANC due to firmware that turned out to be completely unwarranted, and RTINGS posting flawed data.","607":"As with the iPhone 7 and 8, Apple has two different SKUs of the iPhone X, A1865 for Qualcomm and A1901 for Intel. While the press has mostly focused on theoretical speed differences between the two, let's instead look at potential real world differences. Before we get there, some background:Apple while an innovator when it comes to SoC, camera design, supply chain, vertical integration, and smartphones in general, has been extremely conservative with regards to the cellular\/RF side of the house. Apple has typically used a 1-1.5 generation old (when compared with Android devices) RF stack, whether it's for design, price or other reasons. As a result Apple has been late to the game or still hasn't enabled technologies like 3G, LTE, VoLTE, Wifi calling, EVS, HPUE, LTE-A, LTE-U\/LAA, advanced antenna designs enabling 4x4 MIMO, etc.So why this matter?While the press talks about *omgz Gigabit LTE is so much faster than 450Mbps LTE*, which no one will hit in real life, nor do the vast majority of carriers have enough spectrum to achieve this, what the press isn't talking about, and what people actually care about is **battery life**. After the display, the two biggest consumers of battery are the SoC and the radios (modem, transceiver, power amplifiers). So what will the difference be between the two models?iPhone X - A1865:* Qualcomm X16* 14nm Samsung FinFET iPhone X - A1901* Intel XMM 7480* 28nm (TSMC?)As you can see, when it comes to the process, the Intel modem is 1.5 nodes behind the Qualcomm modem. A very conservative estimate would be just from the process itself, the Qualcomm modem will be at least 30% more power efficient. There's very little public information available on the transceivers, but given that the Intel PMB757 has the exact same dimensions and a mostly identical die, to the previous generation transceiver used in the iPhone 7, I would once again expect Qualcomm's WTR5975 to have a large battery consumption advantage. A second, potential issue, that will affect battery life is cell edge performance. As [Cellular Insights] (http:\/\/cellularinsights.com\/iphone7\/) excellently reported, there was a relatively big performance delta between the Qualcomm and Intel iPhone 7 models at the cell edge. There were many anecdotal reports that the Intel iPhone 7 didn't maintain a connection where the Qualcomm model did as well. Skeptics dismissed the report and complaints saying that in the real world, a 10-30Mbps difference isn't noticeable. Before we go into that, once again, some background:Phone radios use drastically different amounts of energy depending on what they're doing. For the vast majority of the time, your phone is in standby, sitting in your pocket, or on your desk, with the screen off. During this time, your phone's radio is in an idle state, camping on a nearby cell. When someone calls, a message is pushed to your phone, or you turn it on and start checking your email, your phone's radio is suddenly pushed into an activated state, and is using up to 100x the power compared to when it was idle. As a result of this difference, the phone's radio resource management software is always trying to idle as long as possible, and when active, transmit data as quickly as possible so it can complete it's task and go back to idling, just like a CPU. Now let's take the following scenario:You're somewhere with weak signal, and you pull out your phone to check the score of the game and watch some highlights: * With a good RF stack, despite the weak signal, you connect, download the data somewhat quickly, view the score, watch the highlights, press the power button, and the screen turns off and your phone goes back to idle. * With a weak RF stack, you connect, but the data takes a much longer time to download. Not only is your radio in a high power state for longer to download the same amount of data, you're also sitting around waiting, staring at your screen which has to be on longer as well (which is the biggest power suck of all). In an extreme case, your phone may not be able to maintain its connection with its current cell, which triggers a search for other cells to connect to, which one of the most power intensive things your radio can doSince Intel essentially has no other design wins other than the iPhone, we won't know how much of an issue this is until Cellular Insights or someone else does the same test with the 7480 vs the 7360. Hopefully there's been some improvement between generations but I'm personally not optimistic given the multi-generation lead Qualcomm has. **So what this does all mean?*** It's extremely likely, the Qualcomm iPhone X will have better battery life than the Intel version* What's the actual difference between the two?* The above is the million dollar question. Due to the nature of the real world, and real networks, this is something almost impossible to independently test without tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of dollars of equipment. With the demise of Anandtech, in general tech reporting as gone down hill, and I don't foresee anyone being able to do this type of rigorous, controlled testing. * To compound this, if I was a betting man, I would guess that Apple only sends out the Qualcomm version (ostensibly for network compatibility) to reviewers* My personal guess is that in the real world, there might be a difference of at least a few percent of battery life, potentially more depending on your usage of LTE vs. Wifi, if you're indoor vs outdoor, etc.**So why does Apple do this?*** The Intel RF stack is likely $5-7 dollars cheaper per device than the Qualcomm equivalent which is huge when you look at the overall BOM* Modems are critical, complex, and difficult to engineer. Even Intel with all of its expertise, and resources, is still licensing DSP IP from Ceva for their basebands. Just as Apple is supporting LG to prevent a Samsung monopoly in the OLED space, Apple is supporting Intel (until they do it themselves...) to prevent a Qualcomm monopoly. Unfortunately consumers suffer in the short term. * None of this stuff is sexy, marketable, or generally something consumers care about, so Apple can get away with it* You've all seen the litigation between the two companies so I won't touch thatNote: I am not an expert and this info is all pulled from publicly available resources. If you have differing information\/expertise\/opinions I'm all ears! *EDIT*: Two articles that are of interest and were pointed out in the comments:Real world performance delta between the Qualcomm\/Intel iPhone 8: https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/356437\/exclusive-iphone-8-scores-top-marks-in-lte-speed-tests-sofMacrumors summary of the above:https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2017\/09\/28\/iphone-8-cellular-bandwidth-tests\/*EDIT2*: A number of people have accused me of being a Qualcomm employee, or much worse. I suppose given the length of the piece and general psuedojournalistic standards, I should have included a disclosure, so let me do that now: I have not worked for, currently work for, or are in any way affiliated with the companies mentioned in this post, including Qualcomm, Intel, Apple, and Samsung. I have no active financial interest in the aforementioned companies and do not actively own their stock. I'm sure I have some passive interest in all of them via mutual\/index funds, like the bulk of people in this thread with a 401k or other investment accounts. *EDIT3*: Wow, thanks for the Gold \/u\/CrookedFinger !","608":"While for many of us WWDC may feel like it's over, the keynote is only the simplified consumer focused overview of the new software. The actual meat and potatoes comes from the many dozens of dev sessions (like mini keynotes) where Apple developers and engineers will dive deep into the specific low level changes that make the new software tick. ---------------------I wanted to focus on one that took place yesterday titled \"[Session 202: What's New in Cocoa Touch](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/202\/)\". Cocoa Touch is the low level framework that controls all touch events and their subsequent UI response\/animation throughout iOS. Most notably: scrolling. After reading that iOS 12 was supposed to feature \"smoother animation and scrolling\" on the info page from Apple's website, I was interested to hear what the actual engineers had to say about this. In this session, Josh Shaffer confirmed that Apple has gone through a **full audit** of all native Apple apps within iOS and used those as a testing ground to profile for any areas the core animation frameworks are experiencing bugs and bottlenecks. I'm pleased to report that this session **directly** targeted three major reasons that we've had persistent frame drops throughout iOS despite the exponentially more powerful hardware we get year over year. This has been going on for many years and described in all kinds of ways from countless users on this sub: \"hitching\", \"jank\", \"stutter\", \"judder\", etc. Regardless of verbiage, iOS has been failing to maintain 60FPS consistently during scrolling since ~iOS 7, and it sounds like iOS 12 is finally **finally** addressing this. These improvements will not only benefit the native apps, but should also extend to improving the scrolling\/animation performance of third party apps as well without any extra work on the developer's part. Should make a lot of users here ([especially Chris Pirillo!](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TDCVavaqDJCFjcQxZsL6InzHxPEYWwMMMh9QtfRGjbY\/edit)) quite happy.------------------------------I'm going to do my best to summarize the three major fixes below, but the video linked above is definitely the best way to get a full understanding of what's changing if you're interested. I've grabbed the slides from the presentation and placed them throughout the explanations where appropriate to help visualize what's being discussed. (the little comments in white are my own) Without further ado: 1.\t**An oversight within the [Cell Pre-fetch API](https:\/\/medium.com\/capital-one-developers\/boost-smooth-scrolling-with-ios-10-pre-fetching-api-818c25cd9c5d) causing dropped frames has been fixed**. This was an API introduced in iOS 10 intended to help solve frame drops, particularly those that were the result of [loading heavy data within an upcoming cell during a scroll](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sTNRcAF.png). The idea was that you could pre-load the data (say, a large image coming up before it's made it to the screen upon scroll) in the background so by the time the cell is on screen, the data is already loaded and the CPU performance of the active scrolling thread remains unaffected. While this works much of the time and did in fact reduce dropped frames, Apple has identified a bug in the implementation. Instead of running the pre-fetch *after* the current cell is finished loading and visible on screen, sometimes the pre-fetch will incorrectly start loading future data at the *same time* as the current cell was already loading in on screen! This meant that the CPU was handling not only the scroll, but [also the pre-fetch for future data while there was already data in the process of loading in](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5fEYNV8.png). Essentially, the pre-fetch was a bit \"too ambitious\" and would fetch too early requiring the CPU to load *two* large elements concurrently, often causing frames to drop due to the exact kind of spike in CPU usage this API was designed to reduce. In iOS 12, they [have adjusted the pre-fetch API so it now loads more intelligently](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9a1OVsN.png), vastly reducing the chance that it will try to fetch data too early and prevent a slam to the CPU. 2.\t**Apple has identified and corrected an issue in the CPU performance controller causing dropped frames even when there was very little background load.** This one is an even bigger win for performance in iOS 12. Previously, when an app would alert the system that there was a big load coming up during a scroll and it needed more CPU performance, [the CPU was quite slow to respond and increase its clock speed.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EXSDvax.png) In fact, by the time the CPU was at a higher speed state, it was often too late and the frame was already dropped. This has been fixed, and is actually what Craig was referring to at the main keynote. Essentially, when an app needs more CPU performance to prevent a frame drop, [the CPU will now respond instantly and rocket right up to its high clock speeds](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MxCxlLZ.png), and more quickly drop back down to idle. (all mobile CPUs idle as often as possible to maintain battery life, only going to max speed when required)3.\t**The auto-layout framework has been heavily optimized to substantially increase performance.** Auto-layout is what allowed Apple to begin targeting different screen sizes and shapes in iOS. It controls how most UI elements, text, and content are laid out on the display by automatically controlling spacing for the many different iDevice screen sizes, without requiring the developer to completely redesign an app to support a new screen size. It has been in active use since iOS 8 when the iPhones went big. As it turns out, [Apple discovered that the performance impact of the Auto-layout framework](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/A2uqXD7.png) was actually [scaling at an exponential rate with iOS 11](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qFCWP1Y.png) (and quite likely, iOS 8\/9\/10) so the performance penalty for using it in more complex ways was quite severe. In iOS 12, they have gone through and heavily optimized the auto-layout framework so the performance impact of it is far more linear, which should free up the CPU and GPU substantially when rendering apps. -----------These are the three primary improvements and fixes for avoiding dropped frames introduced in iOS 12. Josh mentions that there are even more than this, but these are the three that have brought the largest increase in scrolling performance and have dramatically reduced frame drops on old and new devices alike. Chances are the work described above is still on-going so the beta builds of iOS 12 may not reflect the full improvement we can expect, but hopefully when we're installing the final build of iOS 12 this September we can finally see a return to the locked 60FPS experience (and now 120FPS on iPad Pros) we once had in the early days of iOS. ----------------------**EDIT:** I feel inclined to tack on a disclaimer. I'm writing this to inform the wider community that Apple is detailing their efforts to smooth out animation in iOS 12, but I don't work for Apple and I don't make any guarantee that the frame drops WILL be fixed. I'm just acting as a messenger here. These are improvements that are in active development for iOS 12, and they are making the promise that it will help massively reduce frame drops in both first party and third party apps. As the only iOS 12 we have access to today is very early beta software, we cannot expect the current version to have these improvements fully implemented. We must reserve judgement on whether these endeavors were successful in solving the problem, or not, only when we have our hands on the final version of iOS 12. They've spent a year focusing a majority of engineering on optimizing low level frameworks to fix this and many other issues (I can do another write-up if anyone is interested, the new session videos dropped tonight). Quite frankly, if iOS 12 ships and the issue isn't solved\/massively reduced on modern hardware (A9 and forward)... *I think we can safely abandon all hope that it ever will be.*EDIT 2: Made some clarifications regarding the first point on pre-fetch.

I've been keeping an eye on the space, mostly focused on Android and transit, since that time. Now that NFC has finally arrived for iPhone, I thought it would be good to share some info on what NFC is, what devices it will work on, and what it will do for you. As for my background and why you can trust me? Other than my love of NFC long before most of you knew about it, I'm also a iOS developer. I built [Home Assistant Companion](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/home-assistant-open-source-home-automation\/id1099568401) as well as my newest app, [TransitPal](https:\/\/github.com\/robbiet480\/TransitPal) which allows you to check the balance and details of, guess what, an NFC transit tag, such as the [Clipper card](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clipper_card). I've already deeply immersed myself all of the changes in [Core NFC](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/corenfc) that are coming as part of iOS 13. I've also been pretty active on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/robbie) talking about iOS 13 and NFC.# What is NFC?NFC stands for Near-field communication. NFC powers a lot of things in our lives today. It's how Apple Pay in stores works. It's how your transit pass (e.g. Oyster, Metrocard, Clipper, etc) work. It's maybe how your badge is able to unlock doors in your home or office. Effectively, NFC is a way for one device to talk to another device and quickly exchange some information. As you most likely know if you already use NFC in your day to day life, the two items must be held pretty close together (but, common misconception, you do not need to _tap_ the items together in most cases. Apple even tells developers in the [Human Interface Guidelines](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/ios\/user-interaction\/near-field-communication\/) to never instruct users to tap). BTW, NFC is NOT the same as RFID. To put it simply, NFC is two way communication vs RFID which is one way. NFC is also newer.# Does my iOS device have the NFC hardware built in?If your device supports Apple Pay in a physical store, yes, your device has a NFC chip. That's the iPhone 6 and later. To be clear, iPad does not have the chip, nor does iPod touch.# I've heard that iPhone XS\/XS Max\/XR support some special NFC features, such as \"background tag reading\"? Why is Apple keeping those special features away from my fantastic iPhone X?!? Why doesn't Tim Apple love me??That's right, there are some special NFC features that are only available to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. They are:-\tBackground Tag Reading-\tExpress Cards with power reserve**Both of these features are only available on the XS and XR because of an actual _hardware_ change made in the A12 Bionic SoC**. Apple is **not** intentionally keeping functionality away from older devices that they could enable with software. There is no giant conspiracy to make you upgrade to the latest device (well, there might be, but it almost certainly isn't being driven by not letting you have the latest NFC features).Details are a bit murky on what changed exactly (Apple doesn't really like to release full changelogs on the silicon itself, let alone the software running on it), but what appears to have happened is that Apple dedicated resources in the SoC to be able to leave the NFC hardware constantly engaged (or in \"reader\/active mode\"). This enabled faster response time when using Express Cards as well as the very handy power reserve feature. What's an express card or the power reserve feature? Glad you asked...# What are \"Express Cards with power reserve\"?Let's break this term into two parts. First, Express Cards.## Express CardsRight now, there are only two kinds of Express Cards: [Student ID](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT208965) and [transit](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT209495) cards. Put simply, an Express Card is a standard pass in your Apple Wallet that has a special power: It can be (with your previous authorization) used without requiring you to authenticate via Touch ID or Face ID like you do for a Apple Pay transaction. Having to look at your phone to walk through a subway turnstile wouldn't be a great user experience, right? It takes too much time. Same goes for a student ID card being used to buy lunch or enter your dorm room. So an Express Card is exactly that, just an _express_ _card_. Please note, only some student ID and transit cards are supported, please click the links in the previous sentence to learn more.## Power ReserveOkay, Power Reserve is another simple thing to understand. If your transit card is on your phone and your phone dies, how do you get home? Power Reserve fixes this. Under very certain circumstances, your phone will allow you to use a Express Card after your iPhone dies due to battery depletion. Here are those certain circumstances:-\tThe iPhone must have been unlocked using Face ID or Touch ID before it shutdown-\tIt must be a system initiated shut down, e.g. you can't turn the phone off yourself-\tIt has been 5 hours or less since the phone shut down (the exact timing is a bit questionable. Apple says 5 hours, but that's in a best case scenario. Everytime you use a Express Card in power reserve, the battery reserved for it will drop significantly.)Assuming you meet all of these requirements, you can press the side button to get the standard \"plug me in\" screen as well as a note saying Express Card can be used. Just use it normally after tapping the side button. You'll feel a haptic when you do.# What's background tag reading?Background Tag Reading allows your iPhone XS (Max) or iPhone XR to constantly monitor for presence of a NFC enabled device\/tag. If it detects one, and it's NDEF message contains a URI record, you will get a notification just like any other allowing you to open whatever the URI is. Most of the acceptable URIs are Apple system provided URL handlers. They are:| URL Scheme               | Example                                                            ||--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|| Website URL (HTTP\/HTTPS) | `https:\/\/www.example.com`                                          || Email                    | `mailto:user@example.com`                                          || SMS                      | `sms:+14085551212`                                                 || Telephone                | `tel:+14085551212`                                                 || FaceTime                 | `facetime:\/\/user@example.com`                                      || FaceTime Audio           | `facetime-audio:\/\/user@example.com`                                || Maps                     | `http:\/\/maps.apple.com\/?address=Apple%20Park,Cupertino,California` || HomeKit Accessory Setup  | `X-HM:\/\/12345`                                                     |Outside of that, [Universal Links](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/ios\/universal-links\/) are supported. A Universal Link allows a third party app to handle URLs for their domain. For example, the Apple Store app will be opened whenever you click a `https:\/\/apple.com` product URL. # I don't have an iPhone XS, XS Max or XR. How can I use NFC?All iPhones starting from iPhone 7 support NFC (iPhone 6 and 6S have the required hardware but Apple somehow botched the implementation so it\u2019s not usable to third parties). However, iOS doesn't constantly scan for tags on devices older than a XS, XS Max or XR. Therefore, the only way for you to use NFC is by using an app that initiates NFC reader mode. This is a manual process and the app must of course have support via Core NFC to start that reader mode. The app most likely won't do anything with presented NFC tags that don't contain the data its looking for.# What's new in iOS 13 relating to NFC?In iOS 12, Apple introduced [Core NFC](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/corenfc) to allow apps to interact with NDEF formatted NFC tags. It was pretty limited as tags could only be read, not written, and only NDEF tags were supported. In iOS 13, that limitation was removed and Core NFC finally is pretty fully featured. Here's whats new:-\tCan read (and write) more than just NDEF tags-\tCan access the NFC tag unique identifier (UID), perfect to stop counterfeiting and identify individual tags-\tShortcuts now offers NFC as an automation# How does Shortcuts use NFC?Shortcuts in iOS 13 lets you use NFC tags to kick off shortcuts. You simply scan a tag, most likely a NDEF formatted one, Shortcuts records the unique identifier (UID) of the tag and then when that tag is scanned in the future the shortcut runs. At least, that's how we think it will work. Not really sure yet due to bugs in Shortcuts relating to NFC. It _should_ be different than the iOS 12 way of using NFC with Shortcuts where you would write a NFC tag with a URL like `shortcuts:\/\/run-shortcut?name=My%20Cool%20Shortcut`.# What does improved NFC support in iOS 13 allow me to do?Well, it's early days of course, but there's already been some interesting developments:-\t[Japan has announced that they will enable the new Individual Number Cards (national ID cards) to be read via iOS](https:\/\/atadistance.net\/2019\/06\/12\/ios-13-nfc-for-japanese-individual-number-cards\/)-\t[The official UK passport reading app that they are using to allow EU citizens to apply for citizenship post Brexit has announced iOS supports reading passports](https:\/\/readid.com\/blog\/ReadID-now-also-for-iOS)-\tA few weeks before WWDC, Apple announced they will be [enabling certain approved NFC tags to trigger Apple Pay to a company](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SteveMoser\/status\/1127949077432426496). For example, walk up to a parking meter, tap the tag, complete a Apple Pay transaction and you've just paid for parking without having to download an app.I expect to see more third party app developers announcing their NFC plans in the coming weeks. A whole new category of apps that interact with the physical world is now possible thanks to Core NFC improvements, you should be really excited by the possibilities. Here's some non-Shortcuts ideas i've come up with on my own:-\tYour transit card is running low on funds. Use the official transit card app to reload funds to your card and finish the process by tapping your card.-\tSet up a bank account without having to visit a branch, just by tapping your passport or NFC enabled drivers license to your phone. The same thing for any number of confirmed identity required things like credit cards, utility accounts, taxes, etc.-\tHave trouble waking up in the morning? Put a NFC sticker on the other side of your room. Your alarm won't stop until your phone touches the tag.-\tHate typing in long URLs for ads you see in the physical world? Just tap your phone to the ad and you can open the URL instantly.-\tKeep a NFC tag in your wallet as a digital business card. Anyone can tap it and be redirected to your website to connect with you.-\tTap an NFC tag to connect to your friends wifi network automaticallyObviously when you add NFC and Shortcuts together the possibilities are pretty endless.-\tPut a tag on your bedside that you tap at night to automatically trigger a \"go to sleep\" shortcut.-\tA tag next to your TV which will automatically turn the TV on and open Netflix on your Apple TV... before you even can sit down# What NFC tags should I buy?NFC tags are super cheap and come in all shapes and sizes. You can get them as stickers, keychains, bracelets, rings and more. You can even buy custom tags with your logo on them and your data of choice already written to the tag! You can find tags on Amazon for about $10 for a pack of 10. If you're willing to wait, they can be had on AliExpress too. I've seen a pack of 10 for $1 before. Usually just searching \"nfc tag\" will find what you are looking for. A specific model I like (if you're willing to spend a few pennies more per tag) is the NTAG216. It's the fastest and largest (storage) tag that NXP, the largest company behind NFC, makes. The NTAG213 and 215 are also great tags. The other keyword to look for is \"NDEF\".# FinaleIn conclusion, NFC in iOS 13 is super awesome and will directly improve your daily life. It's coming soon, to a iPhone near you.# ResourcesHere's everything that I used to generate this post:Apple provided resources:-\t[Apple's iOS security guide](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/business\/site\/docs\/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf).

Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.**UPDATE 2\/1\/20** I got a pair of Master & Dynamic's [MW07+ wireless earbuds](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/hNJAgch) for review and have added them to this review.https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/FkBRRAmLet's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:**Active Noise Cancellation*** AirPods Pro: **7\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **N\/A** * WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8\/10*** WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10\/10*** MW07+: **3\/10**Hands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise\/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect. Unfortunately this is the weakest selling point of the MW07+ as they barely cancel out any exterior sound, falling drastically behind the rest of the contenders in this category. **Sound Quality*** AirPods Pro: **7\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **8\/10*** WF-1000XM3: **9\/10*** MW07+: **10\/10**The MW07+ just took the crown in this category! They sound fantastic across the whole range, have a huge soundstage for an IEM and are the best sounding pair of earbuds I've used thus far. The Sony's come in second with sound that is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. The Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1\/2.**Comfort*** AirPods Pro: **9\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **6.5\/10*** WF-1000XM3: **8.5\/10*** MW07+: **8\/10**The shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them. The MW07+ buds aren't necessarily the most comfortable, as they're a little on the larger and heavier side, but where they score major points is from having 4 different sized silicone tips to choose from, as well as 3 different sizes of silicone \"wings\" that you can choose to fit your ear perfectly. Aside from the Powerbeats Pro with the wraparound back, these are by far the most secure fit of any earbud I've found.**Battery Life*** AirPods Pro: **5\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **9\/10** * WF-1000XM3: **6\/10*** MW07+: **10\/10**Not very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge. Since receiving the MW07+'s, I'm going to have to knock 1 point off each of the previously reviewed buds, as they take the cake for battery life - 10 hours per charge, with 3 charges in the case, for a total of 40 HOURS. **I used these earbuds for about an hour a day for an entire month before I needed to charge the case.****Connectivity*** AirPods Pro: **10\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **10\/10** * WF-1000XM3: **7.5\/10*** MW07+: **6\/10**Both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone. The MW07+'s unfortunately suffer from some bluetooth connectivity issues that are especially exaggerated in certain circumstances, ie. at the gym, walking around a large number of other people with wireless earbuds causes mine to skip considerably, constantly making the music stop and start and even drop out completely at times. By default the earbuds connect through the right earbud (which then sends the channel to the left earbud), and since I keep my phone in my left pocket, the dropouts are considerably worse with this default setting. A workaround I found is to disconnect from the right earbud and connect to the left earbud before going into the gym, which helps slightly with the connectivity issues but doesn't mitigate them completely.**Call Quality*** AirPods Pro: **9\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **5\/10** * WF-1000XM3: **6\/10*** MW07+: **8\/10**AirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here. No complaints on the MW07+ call quality and the callers on the other end sound great.**Case Size\/Pocketability*** AirPods Pro: **9.5\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **3\/10** * WF-1000XM3: **5\/10*** MW07+: **8\/10**While slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable. The MW07+ case is GORGEOUS - glossy, polished stainless steel that's so sensitive to scratches they even give you a cloth pouch to keep it in. Even after diligently keeping it only inside the cloth pouch, microscratches began to appear on the case after only a week or two, so if you want to keep the case pristine your best bet is to leave it sitting out somewhere and never put it inside anything. Otherwise the side is great and it slips into any pocket easily, only slightly larger than the AirPods Pro case.**Workout\/Gym*** AirPods Pro: **8\/10*** Powerbeats Pro: **9\/10** * WF-1000XM3: **7\/10*** MW07+: **7.5\/10**Personally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat\/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat\/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8\/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder. As mentioned in the connectivity section, the MW07+'s have trouble at the gym, presumably from all of the other bluetooth headphone connections floating around there. That being said, the fit is so secure that they have taken the second place spot behind the Powerbeats Pro at the gym for me because they don't fall out no matter how vigorous the exercise is.Ultimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality. At $300 for the MW07+'s, they're definitely not priced for everyone, but if you want the best audio quality of this whole bunch, and a beautiful design that stands out from the rest, this is your pair.Hope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!","612":"I'm someone who has used many flagship Android phones in the past 6 years - namely LG G4, S6 Edge+, S7 Edge, S9 and S10+. I'm an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I'm not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I've used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bg2bb2\/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bo2ohn\/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10\/).I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4\" S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the \"smaller\" Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the \"smaller\" iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).**Performance & Software Experience**The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won't know the feeling that I'm talking about.For sure, I miss the S10+'s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It's really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience\/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone's software is usually supported for \\~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I'm wrong).**Processor Disparity**The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What's even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won't be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US\/Hong Kong\/South Korea\/Canada?). It's like you're using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying.\u00a0This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won't have to think about importing.**RAM Management**Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don't need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it's not a huge deal since the iPhone's performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.**Display**The S10+\u00a0has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn't bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn't overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+'s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in *Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration*\u00a0and *Camera*), so I'm not too annoyed at that.\u00a0For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro's cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I'm someone who can always tell the difference between FHD\/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6\/S7\/S9\/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than \"One Hand Operations\" and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can't put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro's slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.**Camera**Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR'd. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black\/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom\/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn't soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I'd still be fine with it today.\u00a0Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+'s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone's.**Physical Build**This is all preference here, and I think they're both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.**Inputs and Storage**The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn't enough for me. A \"pro\" phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.**Battery**The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I'm regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I'll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro's battery holds up.Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.**Speakers**Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It's just slightly louder I think.**Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness**For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have [annoying and intrusive ads](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DTqN7Uqr.jpg) on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don't want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don't want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don't want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it's not a huge deal.For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn't mean all apps are \"bad\" on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don't use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like \"Samsung Browser\", \"Samsung Health\" and \"Sound Assistant\" from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you'll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like \"PaymentFramework UI\" update from Galaxy Store, or \"Billing\" or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung\/Android just feels a bit weird.**File Management**S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.\u00a0**Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button**I personally don't like to use my voice too much, but here's my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn't a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into \"car mode\" when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can't just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn't perfect.The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don't like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn't have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.**Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration**The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn't that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it's just a camera image based scanner so it isn't secure at all, doesn't work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber\/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn't turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn't have an issue with!\u00a0 The iPhone's proximity sensor works fine.Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a \"loose vibration\" where as the iPhone vibration feels more \"compact and precise\" - hard to describe.Overall, the biometrics, sensors and \"little things\" are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.**Contactless Payment**Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+\u00a0 the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn't available. So when someone gives you the \"we don't have pay-wave\", you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I've only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn't bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it's located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn't a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.**Price ($AUD) and Value**Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be that much more expensive than an S10+.However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.**Verdict**Taking all these factors into account, right now I'd personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.Since I obviously like writing about tech, I started my own [blog](https:\/\/tech22space.blogspot.com\/) if you are interested.","613":"Towards the end of 2013, my house was unfortunately broken in and had almost everything aside from furniture stolen from me in a single afternoon. One of those things that were taken was my 2010 top of the line 17\u201d MacBook Pro with upgraded SSD, RAMs + all the bells and whistles. Thank goodness for insurance, but that laptop was the most devastating loss of all the items that I lost in the burglary as I had only backed up it 9 months prior due to my laziness. So 9 months of photos, videos, memories, intangible things that insurance cannot replace, were gone just like that.For awhile, I periodically check iCloud to see if the MBP might turned up. I did set a automatic lock on it if it ever connects onlin. It never went online as far as I could tell. Years past and I gave up on every recovering it. Then, in 2015, I received a call from the local police station saying they picked up a \u2018known-person-of-interest\u2019 and on her was an iPad (that was also taken from my home). This iPad never had the Find My iPhone app set up, but it has engraved on the back, a name that does not match this person they picked up. Going through their records, the police matched the iPad\u2019s engraving to my police incident report and promptly dropped it off at my place. I asked the police if the person they picked up could have anything to do with the burglary but they had no evidence that she was involved and thus did not\/could not pursue the matter any further as she was picked up on unrelated incident.While I was happy that I recovered my iPad, the data in it was already long deleted. I didn\u2019t have any important stuff in it anyways so I wasn\u2019t too disappointed that it was formatted. Fast forward into August 2016, while working on my iMac, I get a ping on my phone and alert on the computer at the same time, stating that the MacBook Pro has been located and locked.  I was confused. I had my MBP (current one) sitting right next to my iMac and why the hell would it be locked from iCloud? I went onto iCloud to see the location where it was pinged and to my surprise and realisation, it was showing a location about 10-20 kilometres away. It all clicked in my head within those nanoseconds. It was the bloody stolen MBP from years ago.\u201cWtf\u201d I contemplated on what to do next. \u2018Go see the place myself?\u2019 \u2018Bring friends?\u2019 \u2018Call the non-emergency police line?\u2019  I had to go through folders upon folders to find my police report number. Called up the non-emergency police and explain that the stolen laptop from 3 years ago turned up on Find My Mac app tonight. Got transferred twice to the appropriate department and the appropriate police station and each time I explained, the surprised reaction from the other end when they realised it was from 3 years ago was quite amusing. Within the hour of finding the MBP on iCloud\u2019s radar, the police sent a car to the house location that I gave them and the policeman who was on location called me and said that they\u2019ll try their best but also say that if the occupant denies them entry into the house, they will have no choice but to leave. I can only hope.Minutes later, he called again and said he got the laptop and confirm the description matches my report from 3 years ago. At this point I was unreasonably ecstatic. He also said that they have no reason to believe that the person who had my laptop were involved in the burglary. My stolen MBP was apparently bought off from $500 from a group trying to pawn it off at a cash converter but couldn\u2019t because of a huge deep scratch right down the middle of the screen. Buyer was there to witness it and got it from the group who obviously made up a story about why they were selling it. Days later, I received my laptop. Deep scratch from top to bottom in the middle of the screen, body was very roughed up, especially on a corner, like it was dropped heavily. I do remember seeing my broken gym bag strap on the floor of the day of the burglary, so I can only assume it was dumped into my gym bag and in the burglars' haste, the strap broke and dropped the laptop on the corner.I spent days trying to unlock the laptop as I couldn\u2019t remember the passcode that I used to set the automatic lock 3 frigging years ago. When I did get it unlocked on a fluke, my **goodness**, my account was still intact somehow with all the memories stored on it still there. It was such a huge relief to find stuff on it that I thought I lost.I also brought into Apple Store to see if they could fix the screen (they could not), thankfully they still sell the charger for it. (it wasn't picked up by the police unfortunately, and I also forgot to mention it during the search)Now I have a 6 year old laptop which I only got to use 3 years of it before it disappeared. I do have a couple of questions about this lost and found incident though.  1) I checked through the browser history and the MBP was definitely online (not on my account though) during the years that it was lost, why didn\u2019t iCloud detect it until a few months ago?2) Also, I don\u2019t know what living condition the guy who bought it is in, but the MBP absolutely *stinks*. It doesn\u2019t smell anything disgusting but the stench is very strong, sort of like having your coats dry cleaned kinda of smell. Just very pungent. How do I get rid of it? I have tried airing it (unscrewing the bottom panel), running the fans at high speed for hours, wiping it down several times\u2026. nothing seem to diminish the smell. Any advice is much appreciated.Big thanks to Western Australia Police (Mirrabooka branch) and Apple for the awesome Find My iPhone\/Mac app. TL;DR Home broken in 3 years ago, lost precious laptop; 3 years later, iCloud picks it up on radar, Police happily retrieved it for me; Laptop now stinks, how to remove smell? *Edit: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/WpdXo","614":"In November of 2020 the new M1 Mac Mini was released. Being a long time Apple user, having several products over the years (Mac Pro, Multiple Mac Minis, Mackbook Pro, Macbook Air, iPads, Phones, Watches, etc...) I was extremely excited to see Apple start using their own chips for the desktops.I quickly ordered the 16GB \/ 256GB version to replace my aging 5,1. Upon arrival I immediately setup it up and was extremely impressed with the performance as I expected I would be. However that excitement quickly turned into frustration as once I had charged and connected my new MagicMouse 2 and AirPods I started having constant issues with bluetooth disconnects.Not only could I not reliable use any sound on the new machine (as great at it is, the internal speaker isn\u2019t suitable), but it became a frustrating experience to even use the device as the mouse with constantly freezing, skipping around the screen etc... due to the connection issues.Knowing from prior experience with issues that Apple has world class support I didn\u2019t worry and contacted customer service. After describing my problem they confirmed that it was a known issue and asked if I would be willing to return the device for a replacement so they could further investigate the issue. I was even offered and upgrade to 512GB SSD. Like I said world class customer service.That is where things went downhill. After the initial replacement setup the following events have transpired. * 1. The original advisor had to cancel the request a week later because she had not entered the information correctly, no big deal, things happen. * 2. The advisor contacted me again to inform me that they would actually have to put a hold on my card for the replacement before they could ship it. A little annoying but not a huge deal. * 3. The advisor contacted me another time to let me know that even though I purchased the Mac Mini with my Apple Card that the hold could not be placed on that card. This is where I really start to get annoyed with the process. I reluctantly put the hold on my card debit card thinking finally I can get this replacement. * 4. After not hearing anything or getting a tracking number for a week I call back and speak with the same advisor. She informs me that are shipping delays are due to the holidays. This is the last time I speak with the advisor. * 5. Over the next several weeks I continue to call into get an update on the status of this replacement. Each time I am informed there is a delay but it should be delivered the next week. (Note: every time I called I had to explain the entire situation in detail every single time (often having to get involved with a new Senior Advisor), the advisors seemingly having no way to look at notes, nor understand the issue and my frustration with the situation. I am feeling at this point that Apple really doesn\u2019t care about me as a consumer). * 6. This continues until last week when I call in again. Once again I have to explain in detail what is happening (AFTER the advisor went through several old support cases that had been closed). This advisor explains to me that they don\u2019t know why there is a delay but it still has not shipped and has no idea when it would ship. He said I could contact him this week, which I did but could still not get any updates as to the cause of the delay or when I would get a replacement).At one point I asked to talk to Customer Service Relations, the advisor spoke to them on my behalf, then told me that I could not talk to them because they could not resolve technical issues.In my opinion it is no longer just a technical issue, but very much a customer relations issue. Ok, I finished that call, and immediately called back and asked specifically to talk to Customer Service Relations, not to resolve the replacement, but to resolve this horrible customer experience I have been having. At that point I was told there was a note on my case (wait they can look up details now???) that instructed advisors to NOT transfer me to Customer Service Relations and just reiterate that there is a delay and they do not know when it will ship.I have been a loyal Apple customer for many years because of the stability and reliability of there products, and quick resolution when problems do occur. It allows me to do my work without the need to worry about my hardware or software. If that is no long the case, , I might as well save money and go back to resolving issues on my own on a different platform.Apologies for the rant, but this has left a really bad taste in my mouth and makes me want to no longer purchase Apple products.","615":"Almost exactly a year ago I released Apollo and you all were amazing. Just wanted to say a wholehearted thanks for making this last year so amazing, and I'm stoked for the years to come. I've got a ton planned.Today Apollo 1.3 is available! It brings probably the most requested feature at this point: notifications. It also brings some other awesome features such as App Theming, and a new custom icon. Also a ton of bug fixes as well (notably around that dang cache bug, sorry about that). ### Apollo 1.3Notifications have been notably absent from Apollo from the get-go, but it's been because they're a really hard thing to do, and to do right. Long story short, there's a few ways to do them. You can do it completely on device, but this affects device battery life, and causes substantial delays in delivery as it can only fetch so often. An option that fixes these downsides is to do all the work on an external server, which doesn't affect battery life, and results in instant delivery. [Here's a video of Scott Forstall talking about server advantages way back in iPhone OS 3.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M3fMDdmcsaU)On top of all this, recent versions of iOS really also souped up the power of what notifications can do on the device, but weirdly a lot of apps don't take advantage of that (look at iMessage for an app that does, how you can view your messages and reply inline).For Apollo, I really didn't want to cut corners, so I've spent the last few months building up a really awesome solution with a dedicated server to handle the notifications, as well as taking advantage of everything iOS has to offer for making notifications powerful. The result is Apollo notifications are super battery efficient, super fast, and crazy powerful. You can view an entire conversation's context from the notification, reply, upvote, downvote, and more without ever having to leave the lockscreen. You can even customize the sound of the notification, I like making it sound like a turkey gobble. It's like a mini-app in itself.Now, to be completely up front with you, servers have ongoing, monthly costs. Yeah, there's no getting around that unfortunately. I'd love to just say \"here, everyone who has Pro gets notifications!\" but where I made Pro a small, one-time fee, the notifications server and its ongoing costs mean that I'd eventually be in the red on that exchange, and keeping Apollo sustainable and healthy for the future is obviously a massive priority of mine. I want to keep the lights on.On the flipside, I 100% know, understand and agree with [how most feel about subscriptions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/8hk2tr\/app_subscriptions_suck\/). They're abused more and more lately, and they're expensive. So [I talked it over with the community](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/8k6mkl\/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and\/) and I wanted to come up with a reasonable solution to help pay for ongoing server costs, without gouging customers and infuriating them with something crappy.I knew I couldn't compete with Netflix and whatnot and add another $10\/month subscription to users, but as said servers have ongoing costs to me, so I elected to offer an option in the app to pay a meager 99 cents a month and you can have full access to notifications. I really hope you guys can find this reasonable and know I put a ton of work and talk into this update to make it as reasonable as I possibly could. I've worked really hard over the last year to work with the community on Apollo, so please understand that I honestly do really care about the community, and I hope my actions over the last year speak to that even more than my words.### Show me a video of the features!Okay! https:\/\/vimeo.com\/297431875### So how do I get notifications?Notifications are bundled into a new pack called \"Apollo Ultra\". Hold up! Why not just call it \"Apollo Notifications\"? Well, I did that at first, but it [didn't go so well](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9l3ema\/apollo_13_rejected\/). Essentially Apple has a rule (3.2.2 subsection ii) that apps can't charge directly for system capabilities like push notifications. Apple very nicely called me and explained that they know there's associated costs with push notifications and the server required for them, but to prevent potential abuse this is a rule they have. They suggested to bundle it in with other features that aren't system capabilities (eg don't bundle it in with AirPlay streaming), and after [talking with the community](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9l3ema\/apollo_13_rejected\/) we came up with some simple cool features to add to it that aren't massive deals if you don't have: App Theming (changing the colors of the app around), and some more custom app icons. So the end result is Apollo Ultra is a pack that has notifications, App Theming, and a new custom icon every month.### What does it notify me of?It notifies you of everything in your Reddit inbox: post replies, comment replies, username mentions, and private messages.### Walk me through your process of building this update.I started with a [thread in the ApolloApp subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/8k6mkl\/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and\/) talking about my plans and to see if it made sense. People seemed to understand the costs and like my concept, so I started building. Then [I got some feedback on the UI](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/91d5pr\/notifications_does_this_ui_make_sense_to_yall\/) to make sure it was clear and understandable. Fast forward a bit, it had been tested by the community and everyone seemed to like it, so I submitted it to Apple, and [it was unfortunately rejected](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9l3ema\/apollo_13_rejected\/) (but Apple was cool). People gave some suggestions and ideas. I talked with the community and [laid out my plans](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9muoml\/hey_ill_be_less_available_for_the_next_7_days\/). I talked to Apple on the phone [and they were super cool and basically agreed with the plans so I updated the community](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9ontns\/update_on_apollo_13_and_plans_for_it\/) and got to work. I then submitted it, and Apple approved it! And here we are.### Apollo Pro?I want to be really, really, really clear that Apollo Pro is not going anywhere, not only that, but it's still the main part of Apollo, and will continue to be indefinitely. Zero plans to change that. So many of you supported Apollo right out of the gates, and the last thing I want to do is give the middle finger to a group of people I owe a ton to. Apollo Ultra is an optional, separate pack that you can get if you want, or ignore if you want. But I have zero plans to move the core of Apollo to a subscription model. The one-time fee model works great, and everyone seems to love it. I don't have any plans to be locking a bunch of extra features into Ultra, and on the flipside I have some really awesome extra features planned for Pro.### Other notification options?I mentioned the first option up there uses the device to manage notifications, it uses a combination of Background App Refresh and Local Notifications. Effectively it wakes the app up every so often to make fetches to the server to see if there's any new notifications. This has some downsides, notably that all this is performed on the device, which negatively affects battery life (for instance Apple turns this capability off during Low Power Mode). Further, this fetching can only happen periodically (it varies and is decided by iOS, can be 15 minutes to every several hours in frequency) so the notifications themselves can be quite delayed. I had this as an option called \"Basic Notifications\" in the previous build that was rejected, but don't worry, I plan to add it as an option back, I just wanted to make sure when I submitted this new build everything was clear to Apple and I didn't add any more confusion to potentially get it delayed further. So if you're okay with the above downsides, Apollo will also have a free option for notifications, so please understand that I'm truly trying to be as reasonable about this as possible!### You could merge Pro and Ultra?I don't really want to move the Pro features to a subscription model, I like how they are now. It would be more streamlined to just have one \"pack\", yes, but I think in the end this will make everyone happier. For this reason you also don't \"automatically\" get Pro if you get Ultra, because I don't want to conflate the two, and it introduces a lot of complexity around whether or not it should be removed after the subscription expires.### Still don't like subscriptions, any other options?You don't have to go by the month (99c), there's a cheaper yearly option for $10, or for a limited time if you really don't like subscriptions there's a lifetime unlock for $20. That price will last for 1 week from today, so act quick if you want it!### I don't want notifications but still want the other stuff or to support youYou can totally get Apollo Ultra and just leave notifications turned off if they're not your cup of tea, you'll still get everything else and help Apollo's development!### Tell me about this custom icon every month.So I figured if I was going to add extra custom icons (which everyone seems to love) to Ultra, I didn't want to just lazily throw in one I threw together in a few minutes. So I worked with The Iconfactory and commissioned them [to build a super sick custom icon](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apolloapp\/comments\/9rd6jp\/the_iconfactory_bringing_the_heat_with_a_really\/). So basically every month you'll get a cool special icon included as part of Ultra. I worked with some other really talented designers to build some other really cool icons (some with pixel art!) so that these icons look really cool. I want this feature to be awesome.### iPad update?!Notifications took a ton of work. But I'm really glad it's behind me because now I can focus on the iPad update. I'm going to be working on 1.4 and 1.5 in tandem with the iPad update so I'm not just going to disappear for awhile, but I'm really stoked to be able to now have a bunch of time to put into the iPad side of things and making the experience for Apollo and Reddit on the iPad spectacular, I have some really cool ideas. :)### I don't see the 1.3 update in my App Store yet!It can take up to a few hours sometimes for the update to hit every App Store, so just give it a bit! Sometimes it can also help if you search for the app and go right to its page and hit the \"Update\" button from there rather than the Updates tab.### I have other questions!I'll hang around all day here and I'm happy to answer.All in all I really hope you all like this update, I seriously worked really hard on it, and above that, despite it having subscriptions I really tried to do it in a way that seemed very reasonable by talking to the community about it. Thanks so much for the support for Apollo always, the party's just getting started and I can't wait to show you what's in the pipeline.\\- Christian","616":"And even if they were, it's not because of any lawsuit.This is in response to [a highly-upvoted post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/yl5dyj\/explanation_for_reduced_noise_cancellation_in\/) on r\/apple which claims that an ongoing dispute between Jawbone Technologies, LLC and Apple Inc is causing a deliberate reduction in the effectiveness of the active noise cancellation (ANC) in Airpods Max and Airpods Pro via firmware updates.It's the kind of [string on a corkboard](https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/StringTheory) post that Reddit loves to upvote, full of intrigue and conspiracy, but its conclusions are not sound.1. The patents in question are [not related to noise cancellation](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9lRvFD4). They are for microphone arrays and voice recognition. Microphones are leveraged in active noise cancellation, but a firmware update does not change the microphones, and none of the patents describe the arrays being used for this purpose. Jawbone as a company was focused on *voice call clarity* and separating a voice from the background, and the patents reflect that.2. Despite being filed well after they came out, the lawsuit does not include the Airpods Max on the [list of accused products.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZypGG0l) The list is almost entirely phones, speakers and TVs with voice assistance, including those from Google, Amazon and Samsung. The majority of the products listed don't even have ANC. Clearly, the lawsuit is concerning the separation and detection of voice from background noise, not active noise cancellation. It's almost certainly why the voice call noise reduction feature was removed from the iPhone 12 onwards, but it has nothing to do with active noise cancellation in hi-fi products.3. [Adaptation](https:\/\/mindhacks.com\/2013\/08\/22\/the-deafening-silence\/) is the very straightforward phenomenon that easily explains why we perceive soft sounds to be louder after some time\u2014our brains get used to it. Fin.4. Accusations of reduced ANC due to firmware updates are commonplace and happen to virtually all manufacturers of ANC products. It [happened with Bose headphones](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/tech\/mobile\/bose-investigates-mysterious-quietcomfort-35-firmware-issue\/) in 2017, who investigated and found [no reduction in performance](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home-theater\/bose-qc35-firmware-anc-damage-rollback\/). And despite that, [people still swear Bose is messing with it in 2022.](https:\/\/thedroidguy.com\/bose-quietcomfort-ii-firmware-update-worsens-noise-cancelling-1106611) You can find [posts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SonyHeadphones\/comments\/xjdggo\/noise_cancelling_wf1000xm4_issues_after_update_92\/) making the [same complaint](https:\/\/community.sony.co.uk\/t5\/portable-audio\/wh-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-performance-ruined-by-v4-1-1-firmware\/td-p\/2592166) for Sony heaphones too. The fact is, humans are clearly very poor objective judges of noise cancellation. ANC headphones require multiple things to work well\u2014active circuitry, clean microphones, and good passive isolation. It's easy for any one of these to be affected, and when they are, or if the environment itself gets louder, or if nothing changes and we've simply adapted to the new baseline noise level, firmware gets blamed.5. In fact, accusations of reduced ANC in the Airpods Pro [actually first happened in 2019](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/1\/17\/21069953\/apple-airpods-pro-noise-cancellation-problems-firmware-2b588-2c54), then [again in 2020](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/251909973), but the post doesn't include this in their timeline\u2014because that wouldn't corroborate the narrative that the lawsuit, filed in 2021, is to blame. There's between 1 to 2 million Airpods Max being used today. A thousand complaining on the internet about ANC performance is about what you would expect from a placebo or other effect, and not what you would expect from widely degraded product performance. A small subset of users are always experiencing reduced ANC due to poor fit or other reasons, and blaming it on firmware, because how else could the product have changed overnight?6. A design flaw causes reduced ANC over time in the Gen 1 Airpods Pro and is likely the culprit for lots of these ANC-related complaints. Sebum and dead skin cells clog the microphone grilles and reduce effectiveness. The grilles can really only effectively be cleaned by dabbing them with blu-tack to pull out the dirt. It can't be overstated how prolific this problem is: if you own Gen 1 Airpods Pro and have never cleaned them with blu-tack, you *are* experiencing reduced ANC performance. Apple should be transparent about this problem, but it's understandable why they won't say anything, for fear of causing Antennagate-like \"you're holding it wrong\" mockery. But, the problem exists, and RTINGS makes no mention of whether they've properly maintained their Airpods using this technique when retesting their old pairs. This design flaw was supposedly fixed in Gen 2. But it's led a lot of Pro owners, and RTINGS, to think that Apple has been reducing the ANC purposefully via firmware.7. In regards to the Airpods Max, RTINGS is the only site that has ever documented any measurable data about the ANC, but their test methodologies are not sound. In the latest test of the Airpods Max, you can clearly see in the [current test](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/headphones\/1-5\/graph#16092\/7981) compared to the [previous test](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/assets\/pages\/Ur5io1Sj\/airpods-max-noise-isolation-firmware-3b71-small.jpg) that the baseline \"ANC off\" line is about +10dB higher in the bass frequencies\u2014these lines should be similar since the ANC is OFF, but the difference would *exactly* explain the results due to leakage around the earpads.TL;DR - The lawsuit doesn't concern ANC in hifi products, the patents are for separating voices from background noise during calls and for detecting voice commands; Airpods Max aren't even on the list. There is a long history of blaming firmware updates for reduced ANC in headphones from all companies, due to the fact that ANC is a fragile system that can be impaired for many reasons that are not obvious to the user.EDIT: I should also add additional evidence that RTINGS methodologies are flawed. In 2019, they [tested the Bose QC35](https:\/\/www.rtings.com\/headphones\/reviews\/bose\/quietcomfort-35-ii-qc35-ii-wireless-2018) and concluded that new firmware had in fact degraded ANC. But Bose commissioned [their own wildly extensive investigation](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200410064938mp_\/https:\/\/community.bose.com\/t5\/Around-On-Ear-Headphones\/Bose-QC-35-Firmware-4-5-2-Noise-Cancellation-Investigation\/td-p\/285738#inconclusion)\u2014which included such incredible lengths as *visiting customer's homes and testing their headphones in-situ* as well as commissioning a 3rd party to conduct their own investigation\u2014and found *no* evidence of firmware degrading ANC. They did, however, link the cause to headphone cushions that were in poor condition, dislodged, or aftermarket. And yet, RTINGS maintains that firmware is to blame. It's the clearest example yet of a sizable portion of customers\u2014enough to get Bose's attention\u2014making claims about degraded ANC due to firmware that turned out to be completely unwarranted, and RTINGS posting flawed data.","617":"Hi all,I've been waiting since about 2012 for NFC to truly come to iPhone. I've been keeping an eye on the space, mostly focused on Android and transit, since that time. Now that NFC has finally arrived for iPhone, I thought it would be good to share some info on what NFC is, what devices it will work on, and what it will do for you. As for my background and why you can trust me? Other than my love of NFC long before most of you knew about it, I'm also a iOS developer. I built [Home Assistant Companion](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/home-assistant-open-source-home-automation\/id1099568401) as well as my newest app, [TransitPal](https:\/\/github.com\/robbiet480\/TransitPal) which allows you to check the balance and details of, guess what, an NFC transit tag, such as the [Clipper card](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clipper_card). I've already deeply immersed myself all of the changes in [Core NFC](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/corenfc) that are coming as part of iOS 13. I've also been pretty active on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/robbie) talking about iOS 13 and NFC.# What is NFC?NFC stands for Near-field communication. NFC powers a lot of things in our lives today. It's how Apple Pay in stores works. It's how your transit pass (e.g. Oyster, Metrocard, Clipper, etc) work. It's maybe how your badge is able to unlock doors in your home or office. Effectively, NFC is a way for one device to talk to another device and quickly exchange some information. As you most likely know if you already use NFC in your day to day life, the two items must be held pretty close together (but, common misconception, you do not need to _tap_ the items together in most cases. Apple even tells developers in the [Human Interface Guidelines](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/ios\/user-interaction\/near-field-communication\/) to never instruct users to tap). BTW, NFC is NOT the same as RFID. To put it simply, NFC is two way communication vs RFID which is one way. NFC is also newer.# Does my iOS device have the NFC hardware built in?If your device supports Apple Pay in a physical store, yes, your device has a NFC chip. That's the iPhone 6 and later. To be clear, iPad does not have the chip, nor does iPod touch.# I've heard that iPhone XS\/XS Max\/XR support some special NFC features, such as \"background tag reading\"? Why is Apple keeping those special features away from my fantastic iPhone X?!? Why doesn't Tim Apple love me??That's right, there are some special NFC features that are only available to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR. They are:-\tBackground Tag Reading-\tExpress Cards with power reserve**Both of these features are only available on the XS and XR because of an actual _hardware_ change made in the A12 Bionic SoC**. Apple is **not** intentionally keeping functionality away from older devices that they could enable with software. There is no giant conspiracy to make you upgrade to the latest device (well, there might be, but it almost certainly isn't being driven by not letting you have the latest NFC features).Details are a bit murky on what changed exactly (Apple doesn't really like to release full changelogs on the silicon itself, let alone the software running on it), but what appears to have happened is that Apple dedicated resources in the SoC to be able to leave the NFC hardware constantly engaged (or in \"reader\/active mode\"). This enabled faster response time when using Express Cards as well as the very handy power reserve feature. What's an express card or the power reserve feature? Glad you asked...# What are \"Express Cards with power reserve\"?Let's break this term into two parts. First, Express Cards.## Express CardsRight now, there are only two kinds of Express Cards: [Student ID](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT208965) and [transit](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT209495) cards. Put simply, an Express Card is a standard pass in your Apple Wallet that has a special power: It can be (with your previous authorization) used without requiring you to authenticate via Touch ID or Face ID like you do for a Apple Pay transaction. Having to look at your phone to walk through a subway turnstile wouldn't be a great user experience, right? It takes too much time. Same goes for a student ID card being used to buy lunch or enter your dorm room. So an Express Card is exactly that, just an _express_ _card_. Please note, only some student ID and transit cards are supported, please click the links in the previous sentence to learn more.## Power ReserveOkay, Power Reserve is another simple thing to understand. If your transit card is on your phone and your phone dies, how do you get home? Power Reserve fixes this. Under very certain circumstances, your phone will allow you to use a Express Card after your iPhone dies due to battery depletion. Here are those certain circumstances:-\tThe iPhone must have been unlocked using Face ID or Touch ID before it shutdown-\tIt must be a system initiated shut down, e.g. you can't turn the phone off yourself-\tIt has been 5 hours or less since the phone shut down (the exact timing is a bit questionable. Apple says 5 hours, but that's in a best case scenario. Everytime you use a Express Card in power reserve, the battery reserved for it will drop significantly.)Assuming you meet all of these requirements, you can press the side button to get the standard \"plug me in\" screen as well as a note saying Express Card can be used. Just use it normally after tapping the side button. You'll feel a haptic when you do.# What's background tag reading?Background Tag Reading allows your iPhone XS (Max) or iPhone XR to constantly monitor for presence of a NFC enabled device\/tag. If it detects one, and it's NDEF message contains a URI record, you will get a notification just like any other allowing you to open whatever the URI is. Most of the acceptable URIs are Apple system provided URL handlers. They are:| URL Scheme               | Example                                                            ||--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|| Website URL (HTTP\/HTTPS) | `https:\/\/www.example.com`                                          || Email                    | `mailto:user@example.com`                                          || SMS                      | `sms:+14085551212`                                                 || Telephone                | `tel:+14085551212`                                                 || FaceTime                 | `facetime:\/\/user@example.com`                                      || FaceTime Audio           | `facetime-audio:\/\/user@example.com`                                || Maps                     | `http:\/\/maps.apple.com\/?address=Apple%20Park,Cupertino,California` || HomeKit Accessory Setup  | `X-HM:\/\/12345`                                                     |Outside of that, [Universal Links](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/ios\/universal-links\/) are supported. A Universal Link allows a third party app to handle URLs for their domain. For example, the Apple Store app will be opened whenever you click a `https:\/\/apple.com` product URL. # I don't have an iPhone XS, XS Max or XR. How can I use NFC?All iPhones starting from iPhone 7 support NFC (iPhone 6 and 6S have the required hardware but Apple somehow botched the implementation so it\u2019s not usable to third parties). However, iOS doesn't constantly scan for tags on devices older than a XS, XS Max or XR. Therefore, the only way for you to use NFC is by using an app that initiates NFC reader mode. This is a manual process and the app must of course have support via Core NFC to start that reader mode. The app most likely won't do anything with presented NFC tags that don't contain the data its looking for.# What's new in iOS 13 relating to NFC?In iOS 12, Apple introduced [Core NFC](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/corenfc) to allow apps to interact with NDEF formatted NFC tags. It was pretty limited as tags could only be read, not written, and only NDEF tags were supported. In iOS 13, that limitation was removed and Core NFC finally is pretty fully featured. Here's whats new:-\tCan read (and write) more than just NDEF tags-\tCan access the NFC tag unique identifier (UID), perfect to stop counterfeiting and identify individual tags-\tShortcuts now offers NFC as an automation# How does Shortcuts use NFC?Shortcuts in iOS 13 lets you use NFC tags to kick off shortcuts. You simply scan a tag, most likely a NDEF formatted one, Shortcuts records the unique identifier (UID) of the tag and then when that tag is scanned in the future the shortcut runs. At least, that's how we think it will work. Not really sure yet due to bugs in Shortcuts relating to NFC. It _should_ be different than the iOS 12 way of using NFC with Shortcuts where you would write a NFC tag with a URL like `shortcuts:\/\/run-shortcut?name=My%20Cool%20Shortcut`.# What does improved NFC support in iOS 13 allow me to do?Well, it's early days of course, but there's already been some interesting developments:-\t[Japan has announced that they will enable the new Individual Number Cards (national ID cards) to be read via iOS](https:\/\/atadistance.net\/2019\/06\/12\/ios-13-nfc-for-japanese-individual-number-cards\/)-\t[The official UK passport reading app that they are using to allow EU citizens to apply for citizenship post Brexit has announced iOS supports reading passports](https:\/\/readid.com\/blog\/ReadID-now-also-for-iOS)-\tA few weeks before WWDC, Apple announced they will be [enabling certain approved NFC tags to trigger Apple Pay to a company](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SteveMoser\/status\/1127949077432426496). For example, walk up to a parking meter, tap the tag, complete a Apple Pay transaction and you've just paid for parking without having to download an app.I expect to see more third party app developers announcing their NFC plans in the coming weeks. A whole new category of apps that interact with the physical world is now possible thanks to Core NFC improvements, you should be really excited by the possibilities. Here's some non-Shortcuts ideas i've come up with on my own:-\tYour transit card is running low on funds. Use the official transit card app to reload funds to your card and finish the process by tapping your card.-\tSet up a bank account without having to visit a branch, just by tapping your passport or NFC enabled drivers license to your phone. The same thing for any number of confirmed identity required things like credit cards, utility accounts, taxes, etc.-\tHave trouble waking up in the morning? Put a NFC sticker on the other side of your room. Your alarm won't stop until your phone touches the tag.-\tHate typing in long URLs for ads you see in the physical world? Just tap your phone to the ad and you can open the URL instantly.-\tKeep a NFC tag in your wallet as a digital business card. Anyone can tap it and be redirected to your website to connect with you.-\tTap an NFC tag to connect to your friends wifi network automaticallyObviously when you add NFC and Shortcuts together the possibilities are pretty endless.-\tPut a tag on your bedside that you tap at night to automatically trigger a \"go to sleep\" shortcut.-\tA tag next to your TV which will automatically turn the TV on and open Netflix on your Apple TV... before you even can sit down# What NFC tags should I buy?NFC tags are super cheap and come in all shapes and sizes. You can get them as stickers, keychains, bracelets, rings and more. You can even buy custom tags with your logo on them and your data of choice already written to the tag! You can find tags on Amazon for about $10 for a pack of 10. If you're willing to wait, they can be had on AliExpress too. I've seen a pack of 10 for $1 before. Usually just searching \"nfc tag\" will find what you are looking for. A specific model I like (if you're willing to spend a few pennies more per tag) is the NTAG216. It's the fastest and largest (storage) tag that NXP, the largest company behind NFC, makes. The NTAG213 and 215 are also great tags. The other keyword to look for is \"NDEF\".# FinaleIn conclusion, NFC in iOS 13 is super awesome and will directly improve your daily life. It's coming soon, to a iPhone near you.# ResourcesHere's everything that I used to generate this post:Apple provided resources:-\t[Apple's iOS security guide](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/business\/site\/docs\/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf).

I'm an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I'm not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I've used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bg2bb2\/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/galaxys10\/comments\/bo2ohn\/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10\/).I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4\" S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the \"smaller\" Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the \"smaller\" iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).**Performance & Software Experience**The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won't know the feeling that I'm talking about.For sure, I miss the S10+'s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It's really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience\/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone's software is usually supported for \\~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I'm wrong).**Processor Disparity**The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What's even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won't be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US\/Hong Kong\/South Korea\/Canada?). It's like you're using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying.\u00a0This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won't have to think about importing.**RAM Management**Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don't need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it's not a huge deal since the iPhone's performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.**Display**The S10+\u00a0has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn't bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn't overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+'s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in *Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration*\u00a0and *Camera*), so I'm not too annoyed at that.\u00a0For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro's cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I'm someone who can always tell the difference between FHD\/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6\/S7\/S9\/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than \"One Hand Operations\" and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can't put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro's slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.**Camera**Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR'd. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black\/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom\/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn't soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I'd still be fine with it today.\u00a0Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+'s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone's.**Physical Build**This is all preference here, and I think they're both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.**Inputs and Storage**The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn't enough for me. A \"pro\" phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.**Battery**The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I'm regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I'll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro's battery holds up.Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.**Speakers**Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It's just slightly louder I think.**Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness**For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have [annoying and intrusive ads](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DTqN7Uqr.jpg) on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don't want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don't want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don't want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it's not a huge deal.For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn't mean all apps are \"bad\" on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don't use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like \"Samsung Browser\", \"Samsung Health\" and \"Sound Assistant\" from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you'll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like \"PaymentFramework UI\" update from Galaxy Store, or \"Billing\" or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung\/Android just feels a bit weird.**File Management**S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.\u00a0**Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button**I personally don't like to use my voice too much, but here's my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn't a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into \"car mode\" when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can't just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn't perfect.The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don't like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn't have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.**Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration**The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn't that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it's just a camera image based scanner so it isn't secure at all, doesn't work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber\/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn't turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn't have an issue with!\u00a0 The iPhone's proximity sensor works fine.Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a \"loose vibration\" where as the iPhone vibration feels more \"compact and precise\" - hard to describe.Overall, the biometrics, sensors and \"little things\" are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.**Contactless Payment**Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+\u00a0 the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn't available. So when someone gives you the \"we don't have pay-wave\", you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I've only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn't bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it's located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn't a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.**Price ($AUD) and Value**Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be that much more expensive than an S10+.However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.**Verdict**Taking all these factors into account, right now I'd personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.Since I obviously like writing about tech, I started my own [blog](https:\/\/tech22space.blogspot.com\/) if you are interested.","619":"Hello Apple community,I've been holding onto this story for a long while now. I've told friends and family about this, and a few coworkers knew about this as well. I've never seen it posted anywhere before, so I figured this would be a good place to share the story. I'm fairly positive this was handled 100% silently and internally by Apple and their temp agency Volt. I don't think there's any reason not to share this publicly, so here it is.A long time ago, during the iPhone 4 and 4s era, myself and other recent computer science graduates from college took 'Technician' jobs at Apple in Elk Grove, CA, doing repair work on iPhones and iPads. That's what we were *told* it would be anyways; as it turned out it was mainly just 'diagnostic' work, and the 'diagnostics' were tapping the screen to make sure various features were working.This was a painfully boring job, and the tests were so poorly designed that we ended up failing probably close to a thousand iPads for wifi problems that actually had no wifi problems at all. There were many other issues with the tests that, to this day, still has me wondering how they managed to be implemented... but that's not what this story is about. I digress.The work was divided into stations. The first couple stations would grab the iPhones (or iPads in the iPad line) that came in and factory reset them using iTunes, each station using about 8 computers simultaneously for higher throughput. The rest of the stations down the line would take each phone and test it for a specific function to make sure it was working. Phone calls, speakerphone, wifi, screen issues, etc.The work was performed in a warehouse that was fenced in with metal detectors and security all over the entrances. At the time, you were allowed to bring in your phones. If you had an iPhone, you had to register the serial number with security. They would give you a laminated print out with your name and the serial number, and when walking through security you had to show them the print out as well as the serial number on your actual phone. You also had to move the screen around so they could verify it wasn't just a picture of the serial number that you put on the phone.Attempted theft was surprisingly common. I recall at least a few people that were caught attempting to sneak out iPhones. The most notable of which was the man who put a few phones into his pockets, walked through the metal detector after his shift, and when it went off he dashed for the door in a full blown sprint. Hilariously, *this guy was huge and didn't run very fast at all*, and security got to him *within seconds*.Successful theft also happened. One of my colleagues later admitted to me (after my employment was long over) that he got an iPhone out on his last day of employment by wearing a giant belt buckle and took an iPhone to the bathroom (located inside the secured area) and taped the iPhone to his skin directly underneath the buckle. When metal detectors went off, security would pull out those metal detector wands and scan you down, and if you showed them your belt buckle was setting it off they'd just let you walk through after the rest of your body was scanned. I always wondered if he prepped the night before making sure he was very smoothly shaven so he wouldn't rip out hairs when removing the phone (lol).Now to the main point of the story: one newer technician who we'll call Dave, about a few months into his 12 month contract, came up with a very creative way to get iPhones out of the building. During this time, none of us knew what was going on, all we knew was that Dave had a station that he really liked working at; the receiving station. For most of us it was the worst station to work at because your speed set the pace for the rest of the line, and it never had any downtime. We almost always just let him have that station. Even when stations were rotated or assigned by management, he usually managed to hang on to that one by talking his way into it.As time went on, some of us started realizing that Dave had 2 iPhones he would bring with him in to work, and then take out back through security every day. One of us asked him about it and he said he had a personal phone and a second phone for a side business he was running. A satisfactory answer for us; nobody asked him about it again.More months passed, and I got a job offer at another company for a 'real' IT position, and several of the techs hired with me were at the end of their 12 month contract, so there was a sudden rotation in people. A couple weeks after my employment ended, I got a call from one of my former colleagues about Dave. Apparently, one of the new techs was inspecting Dave's work really closely, and noticed that Dave was rooting (jailbreaking) some of the iPhones he was working on, and changing the serial numbers to match the serial numbers on his laminated print outs.Dave would simply walk out to his car with 2 iPhones during lunch, drop them off at his car, walk back in empty handed, and walk back out at the end of the day with 2 more iPhones.The tech reported him to management and he was arrested. Apple was quiet about the numbers and details, but those of us who worked that specific line who had been at Apple for a while could put 2 and 2 together, and we knew exactly how long this was going on. Figuring that Dave would have easily been able to steal 4 iPhones a day most days, 5 days a week, over a 3 to 4 month period, the total number of iPhones adds up fast!Last I heard many years ago, Dave was serving time in jail. If I had to guess, I'd bet he'd probably tell you now that the theft wasn't worth it.","620":"So, after 8 years and 3 Android phones I decided to give iOS another try after a long stay in Android land.The reason of my switch has absolutely nothing to do with me not being satisfied with Android, nor does it have anything to do with the apple ecosystem.I don't have a Mac, I don't have an iPad, I don't use iMessage and neither does anyone I know.Some of these things may change in the future depending on how much I like this phone but I just wanted to set the stage: I don't have an horse in the race and my choice of mobile OS doesn't define my personality, I'm just a guy who likes tech and wants to offer his perspective even if it's not exactly something new.My last iPhone was the iPhone 4 and at that time nothing came close, it was simply so far ahead of the competition that assuming you could afford one there wasn't even a choice.No other phone was able to impress me for a good few years, until the HTC One m7 came along with its amazing design, large screen and those front facing speakers, I liked the damn thing so much that i decided to switch and my iPhone 4 was on its last leg anyway.I kept the M7 for three years and i customized the shit out of it. I'm talking different launchers, custom ROMs, Rooting etc. I had a lot of fun and probably brought the thing to an early grave because despite being relatively tech savy I didn't always REALLY knew what I was doing.The next two upgrades were much more boring, an LG G6 on which I installed Nova Launcher and called it a day and then a OnePlus 7T on which I maybe changed wallpapers a couple of times.Point is I started customizing stuff less and less, so when my mother's last phone died I used it as an excuse to give her my OP7T and get a new phone (handing down stuff that still works well because I eyed a new shiny toy is something that unfortunately happens a lot with me).So I decided to try using an iPhone once again and give my honest impressions on the switch.This is not exactly a review, so I won't be talking about things like the cameras because there's tons of people who have already gone into way more detail than I ever could and frankly i don't think i can add anything more to the conversation.Cameras are amazing, go watch some tech youtuber if you wanna know more.Now let's talk about the switch.It was honestly way less of a hassle than i thought, with the one exception being migrating my WhatsApp chats history. I for the life of me cannot figure out why that shitty excuse for a messaging app has to backup its chats on either Google Drive or iCloud and not on its own servers like Telegram does.Unfortunately everyone in Italy uses WhatsApp, and I couldn't afford to lose the chats because I have lots of work stuff in there so i had to spend 20\u20ac to get a piece of software used to migrate WA chats. A monthly licence might I add, so fuck WhatsApp but that's neither Apple's nor Google's fault.Everything else was a breeze, my password manager synced with no problems and the google apps I use probably work better on iOS(!).Honestly the day to day use of my phone changed very little but there are a few things that I personally like more, a few I like less, some things that the iPhone does objectively better and a couple of things that are objectively worse, plus one where i'm in the middle.Things i like more on iOS:1) Visual language: some people may find iOS a bit boring but it obviously feels fresh to me. The thing I like the most is how everything feels very identifiable and how the visual language of iOS is very coherent without feeling samey. Coming from OxygenOs, which was very close to stock Android, I sometimes couldn't tell OP's apps from Google's, and while Material Design looks nice it's difficult for someone who doesn't use Gapps a lot to tell them apart based on their icon.2) OS design: Not exaclty something functional, but iOS looks great. The transparencies, the animations, everything feels really well thought out and crafted.3) Widgets: Apple took their sweet time putting them in iOS but they work really well and look like their visual style fits better than on android, even if they aren't always more functional. And again, super ironic how Google Widgets look much better on iOS.4) Settings: I am more familiar with iOS settings after a couple weeks of use than I ever was in 2 years with my OnePlus. Nuff said, I'm not putting this in the objective part of my comparison because Android settings are a bit more thorough.Things I like more on Android:1) The gallery: Maybe i'm missing something but why does the gallery app need to put every single pic or video in the main album? On my OP7T every single app had its own folder automatically and there still was a general folder with everything in it. I like iOS gallery visually but I hate not being able to acces only my camera roll.2) App drawer: I like how the App library organizes apps, I like an alphabetically sorted App drawer more.3) Separate volume sliders: Sometimes they can be confusing, my mother for example calls me at least twice a day to ask why she can't hear her ringtone, but it was useful once you got used to them.4) One handed usability: I liked being able to access the notification shade and quick settings without having to reach the top of the screen, or being able to go back from both sides of the screen. Maybe i'll miss those things less once i get used to iOS, maybe I won't, for now I'll let this here.Things that are objectively better1) App integration with the hardware: I'm still baffled by how most apps that use the camera just screenshot\/screencap the viewfinder on Android. Not the only example but the most infamous one for sure.2) Video: maybe the Pixel 6 will change this, but as of now the iPhone is king when it comes to video recording3) Haptics: This may be based on my limited experience, but between myself and a few friends i've had hands on experience with a lot of high end Android phones and none of them comes close to the iPhone's taptic engine. Things that are objectively worse1) Lightning: do I need to explain this?2) No background download\/upload: WHY?3) No universal back gesture: Not having a consistent way of going back is annoying.4.Siri: this one is minor for me since i\u2019ve never been a  big voice assistant  user, but Siri is a good couple of years behind Google Assistant .You can still technically use Google Assistant in iOS but it\u2019s nowhere near as integrated and therefore as useful compared to Android.The one thing where I'm in the middle, and this may be an unpopular opinion, is notifications.I like the notification center, it makes sense IMHO and it avoids the clutter that notification icons can create on android. On one hand it is true that being able to glance the top of the screen and see what notifications you have is handy but I realized that I really don't need them that much.I'm either on my phone or I'm not (duh); if I am i will see the notification as it comes ( and in this case the ability I have on android to instantly dismiss it by swiping it left or right is the superior way to handle it).If I'm not on my phone the first thing i'll see once I wake it up will be the notification center where the chronological order in which notifications are put is more useful to me. Also the fact that multiple sets of notifications from the same app are not grouped together makes it easier for me to figure out what happened while I wasn't looking at my phone.My ideal notification system would be something that combines iOS way of grouping notifications with android's ease of dismissal i guess.Pro vs Pro MaxOnce I decided that I wanted to try an iPhone once again it was time to decide which one. I knew i wanted to go with a pro model but i was unsure about which one. On one hand the reviews were praising the Pro Max absurd battery, on the other hand the Pro more manageable size was appealing as well and the battery seemed still pretty good.I really couldn't decide so I got both. In the EU you have 14 days to return something bought online no questions asked so i figured why not use this time to make an informed decision. I'm spending lots of money on this phone and i intend to keep it for at least 3 years so I wanted to be sure.Now let's look back on my upgrade history for one secondiPhone 4, HTC One, LG G6, Oneplus 7TOr3.5, 4.7, 5.7, 6.5 inches On average every time I upgraded I went up by 1 inch of screen size. None of those increases in size felt as significant as the 0.2'' difference between the OP7T and the 13 Pro Max. The thing feels huge and I'm a relatively big guy, 1.85m with 19.5 cm handsI think it's because the iPhone is wider or because it's heavier but this is the first time that a phone has felt a bit uncomfortable to use(see things i like better on android, point 4). The Pro on the other hand feels much nicer, maybe a tiny bit smaller than what i'd consider the perfect size.What the pro max heft affords you though is the most absurd battery i've ever experienced. Yesterday I had almost 7 hours of SoT and used just a bit more than 50% battery. Now sure most of those 7 hours were not super intensive stuff, mostly music and video streaming, but still that's legit bonkers battery life.The pro is no slouch either, last saturday I took it off the charger at 7am, went to work, used YT music for 2.5 hours during the commute to\/ from work, watched  video, went to a birthday party where I took plenty of video and photos in the evening and I came home at 3.30 AM with 5.5 hours on SoT and 28% battery left. Definitely impressed.On normal days, where I've tried to use the phones as normally and as similarly as possible, I usually end days with 50% battery on the 13 pro and 65\/70 on the pro max. I don't think i will ever consistently kill neither of them in a day, but the pro max is definitely in a league of its own.I'm still trying to decide if that extra 20% battery is worth the extra discomfort during everyday use. I'll update once i've made up my mind as I still have a few days before I have to return one of the two.For anyone who's considering one of the pros, try both if possible even just in a store. The Max is great but I can see it being borderline painful to use for people with smaller hands.Thanks to anyone who bothered reading all of this, I just wanted to share my experiences in the hope they may help someone else.","621":"**LONG POST INCOMING**I\u2019ve been an iPhone user since the first iPhone came out in 2007. I waited until they dropped price and then went out and bought it. Since then, I\u2019ve had every generation and have been a pretty die-hard iOS fan (and an Apple fan in general).I\u2019m also a gadget geek and a fan of technology, so when the opportunity came for me to get another phone for work (in addition to my iPhone 5s for personal use), I opted to get an Android device. My new job makes heavy use of Google services (Drive, Docs, Gmail, etc\u2026), so I figured why not get the phone that works best with these?After doing heavy research, I decided to ultimately settle on the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (unlocked, bought from Amazon, and running on the T-Mobile network). A few reasons for this:1. Screen size. I\u2019m a small guy with small hands. And I prefer using my phone one-handed. The 4.3 inch display is a still a little big for me (I really think Apple nailed it with the 4 inch display on the 5\/5s as the sweet-spot, and I\u2019m going to be highly disappointed when the 6 ups this size), but I\u2019ll deal with it.2. Uncompromising specs. Sony did something that I hope Apple does with the 6 (and what it does with the iPad Air and mini) by making the screen size the only differentiating factor between its Z1 and Z1 Compact models. Spec-wise, the Compact is still a screaming fast phone. Too often it seems device manufacturers think mini = slower (look at what HTC did with the Mini 1 & 2), but that\u2019s not the case here.3. Sony design. I do web design\/development for a living, and I\u2019m a huge fan of clean, minimalistic designs. It\u2019s why I love Apple and the work Ive puts out. I\u2019ve also always liked Sony\u2019s design language. It shows in the Z1 Compact. It may have a plastic back (and even then, I couldn\u2019t tell it was plastic - feels like glass), but it\u2019s a premium looking and feeling device. Feels great in the hand. Also: it\u2019s waterproof! Not water-resistant like that P.O.S. Samsung phone. That\u2019s just very cool.Quick disclaimer: I think Samsung is the scummiest company ever, and I have a serious bias against them. But just them! No problem with other Android OEMs like HTC (the One\u2019s design is cool too, and I would\u2019ve gotten it if it wasn\u2019t for that humungo screen) or Motorola or even LG.I\u2019ve used the Z1 Compact for a week now. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve used an Android device for that length of time, after years of using iOS. I\u2019m going to try to come across as unbiased, but below are my thoughts on the device and the OS (updated to KitKat). First, the criticisms:1. No dedicated voice command button. Now, this could be a hardware thing (I\u2019ve never used a Galaxy device, and I know they have physical home buttons), but it seems most other Android devices these days have eschewed those for software buttons. The problem there is, as someone who actually uses and loves voice command (Siri), there\u2019s no way to quickly pull up Google Now on my device. Say what you want about Siri\u2019s reliability, speed, accuracy, whatever, but it\u2019s always there at the hold of the Home button. Even when the screen is off. I\u2019ve used Siri to set timers, set reminders, set calendar events, get movie times, etc\u2026 and I\u2019ve often done this without looking at the phone (in the car, for example). Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but there\u2019s no easy way to do this on my Android device.2. On that same note- the software buttons are stupid. Here\u2019s the Apple fanboy in me coming out, but I think Apple did this right with having that physical home button. Android\u2019s software buttons basically do the same thing that the iPhone\/iPad Home button does. Go to the home screen? Single-tap the Home button. Bring up multitasking? Double-tap the Home button. But the worst thing Android does is that stupid \u201cback\u201d button. You never know what you\u2019re going to get when you hit this thing. If I\u2019m viewing a message in Gmail and I hit it, it brings me back to the Gmail Inbox. Hit it again and it brings me to the home screen. If I\u2019m in Chrome, it acts as a browser back button. From a design standpoint, it\u2019s confusing to the user. On top of that, there\u2019s redundancies. If you\u2019re viewing a message in Gmail in Android, you can already hit the button at the top left (the way iOS does it). Why have an extra button at the bottom that does this?And I think even with the slightly bigger screen, the software buttons took up real estate and ended up making the screen the same size as the iPhone\u2019s. Take something like Google Maps for example. With those persistent software buttons on the bottom, the Android app ends up showing less of the map than the iPhone app (we might be taking in millimeters, but still). I can see use cases where it might be useful to have those software buttons go away (or turn transparent) for stuff like viewing movies or in the camera app, but most apps leave these on the bottom (Chrome for example - again, the iOS version has slightly more screen real estate).3. Widgets. *This is more of a \"I don't get the big deal\" bullet-point rather than an outright criticism.* I found these things useless. I can see if you\u2019re using your phone for a very specific purpose how it might be good to have. But for the most part, I really didn\u2019t see the need for them. Maybe this is the iOS mentality, but I just wanted to get into an app and do my thing and not spend too much time on the home screens. I think that\u2019s the fundamental difference between the two OSs- iOS seems to be very much about the apps. It wants to get out of your way so you can be within an app. It\u2019s app-centric. Android is about itself. The one exception here is that I did like having a little weather icon on my lock screen. That\u2019s about it.And here\u2019s the other thing- I thought Android had dynamic icons. Maybe there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing (I\u2019m talking about out-of-the-box stuff here, not tweaks), but my Google Calendar app just displays \u201c31\u201d even though that\u2019s not the date. My clock icon is static. Same with any weather apps I download. Not that iOS has this (though it does have a dynamic stock clock and calendar icons), but I thought that this was a cool feature that Android would have.4. When I first got the phone, I started customizing it, moving stuff around, changing wallpapers, etc\u2026 I started having some issues with my T-Mobile service (unrelated to the phone, this turned out to be a T-Mobile problem), and they asked me to reset my phone to factory settings at one point in their troubleshooting process. When I did that, I had to start from square one again. Is there something I\u2019m missing here? I get the feeling that this is just me not knowing something rather than a lack of a feature, but where\u2019s \u201cRestore from backup?\u201d iOS does this brilliantly, in my opinion. You store everything (and I mean everything, every app setting, every downloaded app, etc\u2026) in iCloud, and when you restore your device or get a new one, it\u2019s almost like nothing has changed. On my Z1, I had to download everything again and configure my settings again. Is there no seamless way to do this?5. Redundancies. Redundancies, everywhere! Granted I don\u2019t have a stock Android phone, but I\u2019m guessing the majority of Android phones out there aren\u2019t stock (if Samsung\u2019s sales figures are to be believed), so I think this is a valid concern. \u201cJust root it\u201d isn\u2019t an answer here, I\u2019m talking out-of-the-box. I started up my phone and I have Sony\u2019s apps for Album and Camera, and I have Google\u2019s. I have Gmail and I have Email. I have a Sony app store (or whatever the hell Sony Select is) on here and I have Google Play. I had a Settings app and I had a Google Settings app. And I can\u2019t delete any of these, my only option is to download something that helps me \u201cHide\u201d them from my App Launcher. Which one do I use? Which one is better? I bet it\u2019s worse on Samsung devices with all the \u201cS\u201d branded apps. 6. When iOS introduced \u201cControl Center\u201d the immediate reaction from the Android world was \u201coh, you mean like Settings in the notification pull-down?\u201d But no, it\u2019s not like that. Control Center is better. A quick swipe up from the bottom of the screen and I can access a myriad of options on iOS. Including a flashlight and a timer! The Settings tab in the notifications pull-down on Android is an extra step. This might sound nitpicky, but considering I use Control Center ALL THE TIME, this extra step felt tedious.7. Touch response. I feel like this is only something someone coming from iOS would understand. And it\u2019s not a huge annoyance, but it\u2019s there. As \u201cbuttery\u201d as Android might claim to be, there\u2019s still something off about its touch response compared to iOS. Might be microseconds, and it might just be in my head. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a small delay between when you drag your finger down (like on Chrome) and when the screen actually moves down. Am I crazy? Maybe I\u2019m crazy.8. Apps. It\u2019s the good ones I miss when making that transition from iOS to Android. iOS seems to attract FANTASTIC developers who make really great apps. Maybe someone can suggest some to me, but I haven\u2019t found anything comparable to these iOS-only apps on the Google Play store: Tweetbot, OmniFocus, Fantastical, Dark Sky\/Weather Line, Reeder 2, AlienBlue (and no, Reddit is Fun and Bacon Reader are nice, but not nice enough IMO). And all these above are my frequently used\/front-and-center apps. There is nothing comparable on the Play store with the amount of polish and care that these developers have put into these apps. Also, something weird: I downloaded a Dark Sky rip-off called Arcus. And then since I like paying for apps (and hate ads), I went and bought something called the Arcus Weather Pro Key to upgrade. Both were in my app drawer. Is this how in-app purchases work on Android? Very clunky if so.9. The previous point brings me to this one\u2026 polish. The Android counterparts to iOS apps felt clunky and messy. There was no cohesiveness to them (this is coming from a design standpoint, of course). Evernote on iOS looks awesome. Clean, simple, minimalistic. Evernote on Android does not. Maybe Evernote will bring these changes to its Android app as well. But iOS was clearly the priority, and I think a lot of developers see it that way as well. Apps come to iOS first, and in my opinion, they look best on iOS. Hell, I actually think the Gmail app on the iPhone looks better than the one on Android. Ditto with the Hangouts app.10. Android doesn\u2019t feel like a finished or polished product to me out-of-the-box. It relies on you to tweak it and finish it yourself. It\u2019s like when you go to a Tex-Mex restaurant and order a fajita and they bring you everything separately and expect you to put it together the way you want. Some people like that experience (my dad, for one). I prefer just getting a burrito ready-to-eat.Ok, ok, I didn\u2019t like a lot of things. But there must be some stuff I liked, right? Yep! I tried to keep an open mind despite my iOS way-of-thinking, so-1. Clear all notifications button. Why doesn\u2019t iOS have this? It\u2019s such a no-brainer that its omission in iOS just seems silly.2. At least on my Xperia Z1 Compact, I had a dedicated camera button. As someone who takes a lot of pictures, I LOVED this. One tap of this and instant camera launch. This might be a feature that iPhones never get, but it\u2019s very useful.3. Default apps. I liked that I could make Gmail my default mail app, among others. This seems like another no-brainer for iOS to have. Maybe we\u2019ll see it with iOS 9.4. I think Tasker is pretty awesome. I could set it up so that when I plugged my headphones in, it would launch Spotify. If I\u2019m below a certain battery level, it can automatically turn off some things. It\u2019s a level of automation that I wish iOS would have as well, though I\u2019m sure if Apple did do this, it would be baked in and not through a third-party app.5. REALLY looking forward to getting SwiftKey\/predictive typing when iOS 8 comes out. Also: loved the way Android apps \u201cspoke\u201d to each other. With the dozens of APIs and Extensions coming with iOS 8, this is going to become less of a feather in Android\u2019s hat, but gotta give credit where credit is due in terms of having it before iOS.I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have more gripes and also more likes as I continue using this Android phone. Maybe I\u2019ll do a follow-up. Since I know people get worked up over criticisms of their favorite tech gadgets, I\u2019m going to note here that these are ALL MY OPINIONS. I might even be wrong with some of these criticisms, and I welcome anybody to politely point out workarounds or say \u201cbut Android DOES do that!\u201dBottom line: I\u2019m not switching. And at the trajectories both OSs are headed in, I don\u2019t see that changing for quite some time. What has changed throughout the experience of using a device with a different OS is that I can see why a LOT of people like Android. They like fajitas, and that\u2019s ok. Ultimately, even my criticisms can come off as nitpicks because both OSs are on equal footing these days in terms of capabilities (or at least will be with iOS 8). Those same nitpicks are important to me, however, because UX and UI are things that I look out for, and I just don\u2019t think Google and Android are there yet. Maybe some day.Sorry for the long post! If you read through it, I welcome your comments and will respond to as many as I can.Edits: Formatting, clarifications","622":"Noticed the popularity of yesterday's post, figured I'd offer my opinion in coming the other way. My first \"smart device\" was an iPod touch that I purchased back in 2008. I suppose this could qualify as my first iOS device, but since it is not a phone, I am excluding it from this list. Since then I have used  Android devices exclusively up until this week.meI am a tech enthusiast and love to tinker with my devices pushing them to their full potential. After considering several new devices, of which most were Android, I decided on the iPhone 5s (unlocked 32gb, off contract, bought from Swappa) for several reasons. 1. Appearance: The closest I've gotten to a \"Apple-esque\" style phone would have to be the HTC One. It was the first android I've owned that felt premium. The iPhone 5s, does not disappoint in this department. I paid several hundred dollars for this device, I'm glad that it doesn't feel cheap.2. Experience: Seeing as this was my first time back since **iPhone OS 2.1** I wanted to make sure I got the full experience. This is my first time on iOS 7 and 8, and I wanted to make sure the device was not my limiting factor on how I felt. 3. Walled Garden: I leaned towards the openness of Android, as I like to make everything my own, and highly customize it. With the introduction of iOS 8, I felt it was the first time that I was getting some of the control back (3rd party keyboards, etc).Background: I've owned a Droid X, Galaxy S3, HTC One (M7), and a Nexus 5. That is four different manufacturers, four different skins, and four different experiences. All of those have all been rooted, and custom ROM'd at some point except for the Droid X. I am also a heavy Google services user, but I shall try to avoid letting that skew my opinion. **So after one week on iOS what have I liked?**1. iCloud: There is simply no comparison on Android, for a complete backup solution, that is easy to work, and requires little effort. This is not a feature natively built into Android. With my HTC One I did have HTC Backup which keep my home screen settings, accounts, and passwords, and apps and settings. This was about the closest I've had to iCloud, but it is not a COMPLETE backup solution, which is very handy to have. 2. Apps: Simply put, they seem better built on iOS. Android still this day in age, seems to be an after thought for many developers. Even several Google apps that I used daily, have features that their counterparts lack. I've never had an issue with malware or spam apps, but there is no doubt that the Appstore is much more curated than the Google Play Store. 3. Siri: I used Google Now (GN) all the time on my Android devices, and while it worked well, it is built like a search engine, and not a personal assistant. You cannot change system settings with GN, something that Siri handles with ease, and Siri is able to handle a much wider range of questions. The voice recognition seems to work better as well (English, no accent). 4. Ease of use: Now this may be a downside to some, but the fact that the appearance has changed very little over time, makes iOS one of the easiest operating systems to use. I picked up the phone and felt immediately familiar to the days of my iPod touch. Each Android phone I've owned has had a vastly different feel, and while some of that does add to the experience and feature set, I can't help but feel slightly unfamiliar picking up a new Android phone.  5. Touch ID: My phone rarely leaves my sight\/pocket, and as such I typically leave my devices without a pin code setup. I'll check my phone for few seconds quite frequently, and having to type in a code  was quite bothersome. With that being said, I do have a pin code setup on my 5s, but with Touch ID that mitigates the necessity of having to type it in. It's quite quick, and the only times it's failed on me have been when my hands are greasy or dirty which is understandable. 6. Fragmentation: With having only a few devices, fragmentation is very limited on iOS devices. Updates are also available much more rapidly compared to Android. I've had devices abandoned much sooner then I would imagine, and this issue just doesn't really exist on iOS. **So after one week of not having Android (HTC One) what have I missed?**1. Screen Size: This is person dependent, and for me, the iPhone 5s is to small. I've played around with screen sizes from 3.5\" to 5.7\" and found that my sweetspot is around 4.7\". This is something Android has a benefit with as there's a multitude of devices, and screen sizes. 2. Front Facing Speakers: This was one of my biggest draws towards the HTC One, it looks amazing, and sounds amazing. There really is no mobile equivalent it terms of speaker quality. It makes a world of difference when showing a friend a video\/vine\/snapchat\/etc in a crowded\/noisy environment. 3. Default apps: If I don't like the default app that Google, or a manufacturer provides me out of the box, I can switch that app out for something else. This isn't possible on iOS, so you're stuck using the default, or trying to workaround the platform using a 3rd party app.4. Rooting\/ROMS: If I don't like the \"skin\" that my phone has, I can put a custom ROM on it, and completely change the look\/feel\/feature set\/performance. I've added things that even stock Android doesn't have, along with various tweaks, that enable me to change literally a million and a half settings for anything and everything I'd like. There is no comparison on iOS, jailbreaking enables but a fraction of what is possible on Android. 5. \"Specs\": Now I put specs in quotations for a reason. On a spec level, flagship Android device blow iOS devices out of the water. This doesn't necessarily mean iOS is slow, as we all know it's not. I don't put much weight on the CPU or RAM, as the experience on iOS is speedy, and it works well despite having much lower specs. The area that I do miss however, is having an HD screen. I don't think 2K is necessary at this point in time, but a 1080p screen I do miss having. With the smaller screen size of iOS, even a 720p screen would suffice well. But for the newest device, to not even have a HD resolution, that takes a point off for me. I do think the \"Retina\" display looks nice, but if the iPhone 6 is larger, I would hope for an HD resolution. 6. Onscreen buttons\/Physical buttons: With Android you have the choice in choosing a phone with onscreen buttons, or choosing a phone with physical buttons. I prefer onscreen buttons for several reasons. Onscreen buttons can follow the orientation of the phone, so if I'm holding my phone upside down my home button is still in the same location. I also change in and out of apps much more than a typical user, and as such I've enabled touch assist on my 5s.Same as any opinion, these obviously are my own, and several of these could be different if you held a different opinion. Bottomline: I'm switching. At this point in time, iOS fulfills more of my needs than Android, but if that changes in the future, perhaps I'll switch back. I chose the title to mirror the other post, but honestly, I'm neither an Android fanboy, nor an Apple fanboy. I choose the device that is best for me. EDIT: Seems I'm going to have to stop by \/r\/Jailbreak. I haven't used Cydia in at least 4 years, so I suppose much has changed. ","623":"I switched back to the iPhone just last night. I went from a Samsung Galaxy S4 back to an iPhone 5. To avoid any fanboyisms - as everyone has said - each platform has its strengths. I have to preface with the first thing that I noticed - The apps. The app store and the apps themselves are a definite 'step up' over Android.  Things such as my banking app, Starbucks app, etc, not only work better...they just...*look* better.  My S4 commonly had apps that looked like they scaled awkwardly with graphics that aren't as crisp as they should be. This drove me nuts at first but I learned to deal with it. My S4 started to annoy me by simply not working right when I needed it to. There was 2 occasions where my GPS would either crap out all together (thus crashing the Google Maps app) or cut off the turn by turn at the very last sentence...which often involved where I had to turn. This made me late for 2 meetings that I wouldn't typically be late to.  It was a series of the little things that added up to tons of frustration. The battery was another area that left me feeling a little frustrated. Particularly the 'sleep' mode where my phone would be resting by my bedside. This would result in a 20% decrease overnight. This could have been an app or something I had running that was periodically waking my phone overnight...but I never looked into it more.  That being said - expandable batteries were great to have and we constantly had a few with us at any given time. The Samsung bloatware also didn't help. It felt like the phone wanted to be two things...a great Android device...and a device that Samsung wanted to use to force their subpar services down peoples throats. This was a real killer for me...but much like everything else, I learned to deal with it over time. I will definitely miss MightySMS.  To be able to text from your desktop was a really nice feature.  I'm also a Google junkie (my life runs through Drive and Google services) So i'll miss the tight integration - but it seems everything I need is available on the iPhone.It's hard to explain. The iPhone has a smaller screen - no expandable battery - and alot less 'options' than what I was used to with the S4...but maybe that is it's strength. Apple is focused on doing one thing very well - making a great phone with great apps.  It's that focus that i'm happy to have re-discovered. Sorry if this was long - just had to share!
