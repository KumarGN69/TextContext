Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"},"10":{"post_title":"A 128GB Pixel 9 Pro should never exist, Google","self_text":""},"11":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Can't receive nudes via rcs\/sms?","self_text":"Title says it allThe girl I'm seeing at the moment was a bit upset with me today, given I hadn't responded to her spontaneous spicy pictures she's sent my way    I (*after reassuring her that I was in fact very appreciative of the gesture*) was very confused and showed her no eye cady had been received    We ran some tests together after having a laugh, and found out that my Pixel 9 Pro won't receive any nude pictures via google messages, but other messaging services like whatsapp and facebook messenger seem fine?

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"16":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL to start at $1,099 as more leaks confirm specs and AI features","self_text":""},"17":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.  For some context, I\u2019ve owned many iPhones starting with the iPhone 3G, 4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/x\/12pm\/14pm etc as well as many Nokia phones (N8,N9,N95,N97,N97 Mini, Lumia series etc), BlackBerries and of course Android phones (HTCs, Nexus 4,5,6P,Pixel 2XL, Pixel 7P,8P and now 9P XL).This is just an appreciation post for the Pixel 9 Pro\u2026.  While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season!

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"50":{"post_title":"Pixel Tablet Standalone + A Series Buds I\/O Bundle","self_text":""},"51":{"post_title":"Pixel Buds Pro 2- Unbiased review from someone who's used many earbuds.","self_text":"So, I've been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for a day now, and I'm pretty happy with them overall.

Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"53":{"post_title":"Switched to pixel 9 pro after 10 years of iPhone, help me keep my choice!

I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive. They suggested waiting until Monday so it would be cheaper - around \u20ac500, especially if it\u2019s on the route of the maintenance guy. So here\u2019s my dilemma \u2013 should I take the risk and pay to retrieve it, hoping it\u2019s still alive and functional, or leave it there and cut my losses? It\u2019s a brand-new, expensive phone, but \u20ac500 is a lot of money if it\u2019s completely broken\u2026What would you all do? Anyone else ever been through this? Could my protective gear have saved my Pixel 9 Pro?[lift shaft ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TZTSg3a.png)Update #1:Spend 1 hour with my magnet on a stick to poke around the shaft, but it's way deeper than my stick could reach. Tried to use my flashlight on every side to see if it's on the ground somewhere, but was unable to spot it. I think I was able to see only 5% of the whole area.I'll make some calls tomorrow to the building manager and the lift shaft maintenance company!Update#2I tried for 2 days to get contact with the company that does the maintenance. Called like 5-10 times. They would call back etc, but never did.Last time I called I said: \"I've read about a fire hazard risk, because the Li-on battery could be broken and explode in a few days, I've read about this online, could you add this to the ticket and let your supervisor know about this?\".Looks like that worked, because they will be at the building this week!Update #3Today was maintainance day and they found the phone. They will hand it over to me tomorrow. But they already made a picture and video and told us it was completely crushed, not working etc. I'll post the pics when I have it!

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV.

Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"57":{"post_title":"What does it take to break a Pixel phone?","self_text":"I've been using extremely budget-friendly smartphones all my life, but just a week ago, I upgraded during \"Black Friday month\" and purchased a Pixel 8a. While it's not a flagship model, for me, this was quite a significant investment.Within just seven days, I've managed to drop the phone twice, first onto the hardwood floor and then onto bathroom tiles. The last incident involved it falling from a height of about 2.4 meters (nearly 8 feet). I \"never\" drop my phone like this, so I'm somewhat in a state of disbelief.Surprisingly, I can't find a single scratch on the device, and all functions like the buttons, fingerprint reader, and other features seem completely unaffected.Have I just been incredibly lucky, or is there some kind of magic in this phone's build? Is it more slippery than the typical Samsung Galaxy A series, or have I just become extraordinarily clumsy?\\-------EDIT: Quick note about Spigen case cost...Spigen gets a lot of recommendations here, and sounds like a great brand. I was just puzzled to see it (Spigen Rugged Armor) is less than half the cost of the original Google Pixel 8a case (obsidian) in my country.

My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I've previously taken. - Problems I've had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as \"gimmicky\", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I've been wanting to try more foods, so I'll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it'll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It'll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used \"Add me\" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there's finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I've had the buds 3 for about a week and they've been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you're on the fence on switching - I'd suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you're worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I've had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds.

I actually liked the Pixel 4 better, maybe it was the form factor or Android 12, but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesn't. The OS now is fine but not great, though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher. But man, the apps on Android are still a mess. Everything\u2019s buggy, and Android ~~15~~ 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways. Notifications are a pain, the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy.

That thing is trash\u2014it\u2019s small, buggy, laggy, and the apps barely work. The photos from the P8P were fantastic, so no complaints there as expected.

When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering.

My wife says calls sometimes go straight to voicemail, meaning she literally cannot reach me in the event of an emergency. And when I can receive calls, the call quality is sometimes so bad that I can barely understand what she's saying.I've done some searching on Reddit and elsewhere and it seems I'm not alone. For every proposed solution, there's a dozen people immediately replying that it doesn't work, which leaves me rather hopeless.On top of that, the Pixel Watch's crown broke off with in the first month. No idea what happened. Just looked down one day and noticed it was gone. Thankfully I was able to get a replacement under warranty pretty quickly, but the warranty process was rather frustrating. When I tried explain that the crown broke off but the screen still works fine, the customer service rep straight up did not comprehend why I wanted a replacement.

The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

It looks like my Pixel is attached to a spacecraft when I do recordings where I move a bit.Also, just in the preview with 50 MP the screen lags all the time. The pictures looks way worse before I shoot em, and good after when I check in my photo folder. Why is it like that?Just scrolling on these apps is way slower and way less smooth on the Pixel.

Seriously?"},"84":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.","self_text":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"85":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL to start at $1,099 as more leaks confirm specs and AI features","self_text":""},"86":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.

While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season!

The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger.

It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen.

As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic.

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"97":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro Best Buy Test: Holy crap this telephoto lens!!!11one","self_text":"Pixel 9 Pro XL at Best Buy: OMG the Telephoto is Amazing------------------**Disclaimer:** Quick Share on these devices was disabled so I had no way to get photos off. I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs.

Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like?

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"108":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro cutting off last ~1 second of video recording","self_text":"I can't seem to find anyone else mentioning this specifically but when recording a video on the 9 Pro, when I hit pause, it seems to cut the video a full second if not more from when I remember hitting the button.For example, if I am panning I will pause the video at a certain reference point, but upon reviewing the footage, it ends roughly a second earlier than I expect.

","self_text":"If you are like me, one of the main things stopping you from going all in on the Pixel line is really poor performance from the modem. If a phone can't make calls, and access the Internet, none of the other features matter IMHO. So far things are very promising with the 9 pro. My office is a bit of a torture chamber for cell phones. I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers. If they ask for the wifi code I tend to take note of what device they are using. Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones. My company provided ATT iPhone is 1 bar of cellular, but no data. My pixel 6 & 7 pros were both completely no service, and would also burn up tons of battery just desperately trying to connect. Today is the first day I am sitting at my desk with the Pixel 9 pro XL, and it is doing fantastic. I decided not to enter in the wifi code right away, and see how it handled being at the very fringe of cell coverage. Not only can I both call, and browse the Internet at decent speeds, the battery is not taking a hit at all. It has been very miserly sipping standby battery, and hardly going down at all while idling, with no detectable heating up.I need to perform some more tests before saying for sure that it is on par with the QC modem in my Samsung, but this is definitely a big upgrade. I also noticed it came close to maxing out my 500mbps wifi at home last night. The 7 was better in that regard, but the 6 pro even had spotty wifi performance at times.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken. Yes we could still support an iPhone 6, but have you tried using one? It's so slow you can't really use it. Forced obsolescence is what pisses me off. Yes, I knew it from the beginning.

I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."},"118":{"post_title":"Pickle 9 pro magsafe case review I tried a bunch of them so you don't have to! ","self_text":"It was brought to my attention that I forgot to specify which pixel.  It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"119":{"post_title":"I've had my Pixel 7 for about a year now and I miss my Pixel 2 (rant)","self_text":"My pixel 2 died last year and I had to scramble to get a new phone by the end of the weekend.Sure, the 7 is nice, I like the battery saving features, it's fast, and the camera and screen are great but this phone sucks in comparison...I miss the squeeze feature to get my assistant, I miss the fingerprint scanner in the back-This new scanner is hot trash and doesn't detect my fingerprint nearly as accurately.

The option isn't even there, they just took it away.These are little things but they add up. My biggest gripe though is a two part,1. The phone is HEAVY, with a decent case it's like twice the weight of my Pixel 2. Kickstands on this phone are super handy to take weight off of your fingers and prop up the phone but2. The cases are garbage. Sure the case itself is fine, but they don't make cases with a good kickstands. I've been through 2 in less than a year with delicate use and they break like the cheap pieces of garbage that they are. This past weekend I pulled my phone out of my pocket and the kickstand came off completely.Google is apparently doing what Apple does and making so you have to buy their brand for accessories too....I wanted to get a dongle to watch youtube videos on my TV with my phone because I use an adblock browser (fight me) and I don't want the ads that come with Chromecast, but these newer phones are incompatible with dongles that let you do that.This will probably be my last pixel phone, I'm very disappointed with Google's business decisions and going along with the planned obsolescence like everyone else. Every generation seems like they take away good features and add unnecessary ones. I like smart lens, I like adaptive charging, but they didn't need to get rid of everything else to add those.I got 5 good years out of my Pixel 2 before it had any issues only to be reminded that newer isn't always better.  \\*Edit\\*I fully expected to get blasted into downvote hell and told that I'm wrong.

Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."},"122":{"post_title":"Long Post Ahead \u2013 My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User","self_text":"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos.

I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!  "},"123":{"post_title":"The things I like about Android","self_text":"Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."},"124":{"post_title":"Coming from an 8 Pro to the smaller 9 Pro","self_text":"It has been 24 hours and I have no regret with my upgrade. Yes, this is definitely an upgrade. You will have heard a lot of people talking about the build quality but until you actually experience it you have no idea what they mean. This thing is on another level. It really does make you think Google was playing all this time. Trust me, I have had every single pixel XL since Nexus died and it has never been on this level. I am using voice dictation for this post and it is 99% accurate. I have no idea what was going wrong on my 8 Pro but it was about 85 to 90% accurate. I spent so much time editing what I had dictated to my phone. Punctuation was non-existent too...and I have the same settings so it does make me wonder what else has gone on under the hood here. Anything that uses assistant is responding much quicker with a slickness that you knew the 8Pro was capable of but just never seemed to do consistently. Lastly, for me this size is perfect.

I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see a brand we believed in let its loyal customers down."},"128":{"post_title":"The pixel buds' google assistant calls my mother on WhatsApp (instead of normal calls, as I would like it to do)","self_text":"The title says it all.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"130":{"post_title":"What are some things you didnt know your Google Pixel could do?","self_text":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"131":{"post_title":"What makes you stick with Pixel?","self_text":"I've been a die-hard iPhone user since 2019.

To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone.

I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive.

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"139":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience","self_text":"Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"140":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL: Overpriced and Underwhelming in Europe?","self_text":"I'm really confused about what to do and whether it's worth continuing to use Pixel devices.

Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."},"143":{"post_title":"Pixel 8 pro, the perfect experience.","self_text":"I've had my pixel 8 pro for at least a month now and I'll go over to the main points but the title says the main thing.Camera: The camera shoots video better than professional cameras with perfect stabilization, 4k60fps framerate stable videos, the photos are perfect because of the ai running on the TPU chip, I don't mind the little loading after taking a photo because it makes them perfect even in the most unlikely and worst conditions. The 5x optical zoom does the difference too.UI and UX: The pixel experience is perfect, no bloatware, attention to the detail, perfect UI, simple, easy to root or unlock bootloader if you're that kind of person, It all couldn't be better. Kudos to Google for that.Hardware and performance:CPU is great, GPU is not the best but can run any game at **max settings** **at at least 50fps**, this includes genshin impact and fortnite at max settings btw. The TPU allows for lightning quick ai photo perfection, recording summarization, audio s\u00e9paration in video, message remixing and more. Also 12gb ram which is perfect. Build quality: Couldn't be better the phone itself is smooth to the touch, beautiful, doesn't break easily if you don't throw it on the floor, stable on a flat surface despite the camera and moreScreen: Georgous, adaptative refresh rate means always on display consumes about 0.7% battery per day if always on. Adaptative refresh rate also triggers when content on the screen doesn't move aka when you read which makes the device last multiple days. It's also OLED of super AMOLED I forgot so the colors are perfect and accurate and beautiful.Overheating: Doesn't, heats just a little bit while heavy gaming but not that bad (not **over**heating)Fingerprint sensor: It's optical so if your screen is dirty or your finger is wet it won't work well and even sometimes when everything is right it won't work, it will tho if you set your main finger two times work perfectly every time except if wet or way too dirty.Face unlock: Everything perfect except it doesn't work in the dark if youre too far from your screen because not enough light. It also detects if your eyes are closed or if you're not looking at it in which case it wont unlock.Battery life: On TikTok lasts an average of nine hours because dynamic refresh rate can't kick in, on heavy gaming 5 for the same reason and also heavy processing, for light gaming 8 because the dynamic refresh rate cant kick in either and processing, while for reading it lasts multiple days. If you use this phone normally it will last one day or two before requiring to charge, it also has adaptative charging so if you charge at night and you setup bedtime mode it'll turn on bedtime mode disabling notification for the night and charging your phone to about 80% and then it'll charge slowly hitting 100% when your alarm rings, slow charging preserves battery. The part of this phone that consumes way too much battery is the modem which is not energy efficient (what connects to the cell tower) meaning that heavy networking will consume more battery.Software updates: 7 years of android updates and feature drops garrented. (More than iphone)Price: 900 bucks, not expensive for a device this quality.Do I recommend: If you're ready to put in the price to get a perfect phone that lasts 7 years, then yeah buy it I promise you you will never regret it. Else buy the 8 or 8a but expect worse battery life, camera and slightly worse build quality and 8gb ram instead of 12, but you'll get he same chip so same general performance except the phone will heat slightly more while gaming because of reduced size"},"144":{"post_title":"My terrible experience with my brand new Pixel 8a","self_text":"It has been a week since I got my new Pixel 8a and honestly my experience so far has been terrible, in all these years having smartphones I never had such a bad first week and I would never have imagined to have so many issues with a Pixel phone.1. When charging, the phone has a very strong and strange \"electrical\" friction all over the metal frame, it's clearly as there's some discharge on the metal frame (no, it's not static electricity because it happens only when I charge it).2. Notifications are delayed even if I turned off \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Adaptive Connectivity\": sometimes I get them only when I wake the phone (they start to pop up the moment I wake it), sometimes they simply don't show unless I open the app for which the notifications are delayed (e.g: I open Whatsapp, I get the messages notifications), I even missed a Whatsapp call without any notification. This is a pretty serious issue (which I never had with any other phone in the past), if my Pixel 8a can't be reliable on basic phone features, I don't know if I want to keep it.3. After the Android 15 update (two days ago), Google Play Services is running in background 100% of the time (i.e.: from midnight to 8am you'll see 8 hours background usage for Google Play Services in the battery details), draining the battery. I see at least 10% drain over 6-7 hours during the night.4. A Samsung fast charger that charges rapidly all other phones instead charges my Pixel 8a very slowly (3 hour for 20-30%), I even tried another cable but inexplicably the issue persists.5. Pixel support is quite absent, I contacted them for issue #1 and then updated them with issue #4 (since it's charging related), they asked for pictures of the frame in the support chat, then for other pictures of the frame in the support email, but then nothing, now it's 5 days that I don't have any answer. Now I'll send details about issue #3, but I don't feel good about this situation.Any idea on what to do or any help would be really appreciated, factory reset is not an option (eSIM would be lost, I would lose access to banking apps which need one device always active, and so on). EDIT: \u00a0I've updated both Google Play (open the app => Settings => About => Update Play Store) and Google Play Services (manually going to its Google Play page).  I think the phone is defective due to #1, but #2 and #3 are not HW issues, so I'm thinking about buying another phone and return this (support not answering of course is a factor in this decision, 7 days of the 14 days for returning it are already gone). It's a pity because I really wanted a Pixel, I always had \"near stock Android\" phones (Nexus S, Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G8, Moto G100) and I thought this would be a sure choice and a solid improvement, but I've read so many threads here of people complaining about #2 and #3 that I'm not sure I want to keep trying with this phone.Thanks in advance! \ud83e\udd17"},"145":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL Bluetooth in Car - No sound for incoming or outgoing calls","self_text":"So this happens to a friend and to me, we both have a pixel 9 pro xl.

Pixel Launcher is the bane of my 8 Pro. The fact that it freezes the buttons once every 3 days or so and I have to open settings to force stop it is ridiculous.2. The native phone app can't be linked to Textra. I have to exit Textra to make a phone call from the phone app. Otherwise it tries to make me select from options like Google voice. 3. The aggressive conservation of RAM limits how fast apps can access location\/Bluetooth in some instances. I have to use an app called LATCH occasionally and there's always a freeze, even if the app is already open.4. Even if phone updates keep rolling out, it seems like Google is ignoring some of the persistent issues that limit functionality on Pixels--similar to the way they handle issues on Google docs, Sheets, etc. The lack of responsive software support will eventually make the phones \"outdated\" even if the hardware is good enough to hang with new gen phones.5. There should be an option to switch the back and multi buttons on the bottom of the screen. I highly doubt this is related to an IP issue since both Samsung and OnePlus have the same setup. Not sure if this is an oversight or a weird ploy to keep the same user base upgrading to a Pixel instead of changing brands.Ultimately, I am very happy with the performance on the 8 Pro. It is fast, has plenty of processing power, and capabilities like default trickle charging to 100% battery in the morning is ingenious. On the other hand, while the trickle charge feature ensures that users will be able to use their phones longer by protecting against battery degradation, it's also an example of a baby bumper, and I miss having the freedom to do whatever I would like to my phone--even if it isn't optimal."},"147":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - unable to connect to car bluetooth, help?","self_text":"I just upgraded from P6P to P9Pxl, and everything has been great, except that I'm unable to connect to my car's bluetooth.

Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.

A new SoC based on the Exynos 2400 with an improved fabrication process. It may not be significantly faster, but it should be much more power-efficient.3. A new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, similar to the one in the S24 Ultra (possibly slightly improved).4. A new modem based on the Exynos 5400, likely offering better sustained high speeds and improved coverage. We're hoping it's also more energy-efficient.5. A new cooling system and internal component structure for better heat dissipation. The benefits are still uncertain, but we're optimistic.6. An upgraded camera array system with a significantly improved selfie camera and enhanced wide and ultra-wide sensors (though the main sensor remains unchanged).7. A new housing design (whether it looks better is subjective).Is this an incremental update? Absolutely not. It sounds like a completely new device.

I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that \"120Hz smoothness\" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8's UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the \"Pro\" models. In conclusion, if you were concerned with the stuttering, I am happy to report, there is no issue with it.

Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

I posted a few heated complaints over my year of P8P ownership, and while the phone never got perfect, I did notice bugs get squashed and overall usage improve through software updates and then the jump to Android 15. Now, after a few weeks with my 9 Pro, I'm happy to say that I haven't had a single frustration with this one. No bugs, no overheating, nothing to make me feel like my \"flagship\" is lacking, like I felt with the 8 Pro.

Also, will they all remain on the lock screen?\\----I have had the OnePlus 12 since about May last year and it was a great phone in nearly every way. However, it has always had horrible notification issues that are now making me want to leave the phone. I had always wanted a Pixel, so I'm ready to make the switch, but need to make sure it doesn't have these issues.On the OP12, it is, for some reason, a feature to show a notification you get on your lock screen and then remove it from your lock screen if you unlock your phone at all. To explain further, if I get a text, it it will appear on my lock screen. If I then leave that text notification untouched and unlock my phone to do anything and then re-lock it, that notification will not appear on my lock screen anymore. At this point, the only way to know I have this notification still is to unlock the phone and see it at the top or to use always-on-display where the notification icons will remain.I *hate* this \"feature.\" I don't like AOD, but it forces me to use it if I want to quickly see that I have a notification. It's extremely common for me to get a notification for something, unlock my phone to do something else without looking at said notification, and then put my phone back down. With OP12, this means I can no longer easily see that I have a notification at all unless I use AOD or unlock it. This means I can't even preview a notification without fully unlocking my phone, typically. Frequently, I want to just tap my screen on, preview a text, and then lock the phone again. OP12 screws me on this constantly.To make it a bit worse, if I get several notifications, like overnight or something, I can't even see them all on the lock screen. I can scroll to see a few and then it just decides not to show the rest and I have to unlock to see everything.The other, more important, problem with OP12 is that it will just remove notifications randomly that I haven't looked at, yet. Trust me, I have every setting imaginable to prevent this from happening, yet it still does. It is not uncommon for me to get a notification and witness it disappearing as I am about to tap it to view. It's a major, major problem for me and is the main reason I don't want this phone anymore.There is also the problem of notifications being removed if you close all apps. This isn't a major issue, but is definitely annoying when I forget that doing it will just clear my notifications for no reason.Anyway, I ranted a bit there, sorry... I just want to know the P9 will retain my notifications when I get them until *I* remove them, and ideally those notifications will stay on my lock screen, too."},"201":{"post_title":"My experience with Pixel 9 Pro XL as daily driver for 10 days and why I'm returning it.","self_text":"Hey everyone, I know you're not big fans of negative opinions, but I wanted to share my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL after using it for almost 10 days.

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"203":{"post_title":"Verizon store warned me about Pixel issues.

Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"205":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another.

The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer.

"},"207":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing!","self_text":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices. To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone.

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"209":{"post_title":"Official Google support rep tried to phish my account","self_text":"***See bottom update, turns out the verification prompt was legit and how Google does things.***Hey folks,I posted this on r\/Scams but I figured it was warranted to share here as well given this began through the built in support system on my pixel 9 pro.Sooooo, I went through the tips & support menu of my new pixel 9 pro and requested a callback regarding pixel 4a appeasement issues (trying to switch from pixel store credit to either the cash or battery repair of my 4a). I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u\/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"211":{"post_title":"Pickle 9 pro magsafe case review I tried a bunch of them so you don't have to! ","self_text":"It was brought to my attention that I forgot to specify which pixel.  It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"212":{"post_title":"Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG).

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos.

Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one!

Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears.

Pretty good devices except software, on the other side these devices are reliable and work well but software can be boring if used for a long time.

"},"216":{"post_title":"The things I like about Android","self_text":"Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."},"217":{"post_title":"My terrible experience with my brand new Pixel 8a","self_text":"It has been a week since I got my new Pixel 8a and honestly my experience so far has been terrible, in all these years having smartphones I never had such a bad first week and I would never have imagined to have so many issues with a Pixel phone.1. When charging, the phone has a very strong and strange \"electrical\" friction all over the metal frame, it's clearly as there's some discharge on the metal frame (no, it's not static electricity because it happens only when I charge it).2. Notifications are delayed even if I turned off \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Adaptive Connectivity\": sometimes I get them only when I wake the phone (they start to pop up the moment I wake it), sometimes they simply don't show unless I open the app for which the notifications are delayed (e.g: I open Whatsapp, I get the messages notifications), I even missed a Whatsapp call without any notification. This is a pretty serious issue (which I never had with any other phone in the past), if my Pixel 8a can't be reliable on basic phone features, I don't know if I want to keep it.3. After the Android 15 update (two days ago), Google Play Services is running in background 100% of the time (i.e.: from midnight to 8am you'll see 8 hours background usage for Google Play Services in the battery details), draining the battery. I see at least 10% drain over 6-7 hours during the night.4. A Samsung fast charger that charges rapidly all other phones instead charges my Pixel 8a very slowly (3 hour for 20-30%), I even tried another cable but inexplicably the issue persists.5. Pixel support is quite absent, I contacted them for issue #1 and then updated them with issue #4 (since it's charging related), they asked for pictures of the frame in the support chat, then for other pictures of the frame in the support email, but then nothing, now it's 5 days that I don't have any answer. Now I'll send details about issue #3, but I don't feel good about this situation.Any idea on what to do or any help would be really appreciated, factory reset is not an option (eSIM would be lost, I would lose access to banking apps which need one device always active, and so on). EDIT: \u00a0I've updated both Google Play (open the app => Settings => About => Update Play Store) and Google Play Services (manually going to its Google Play page).  I think the phone is defective due to #1, but #2 and #3 are not HW issues, so I'm thinking about buying another phone and return this (support not answering of course is a factor in this decision, 7 days of the 14 days for returning it are already gone). It's a pity because I really wanted a Pixel, I always had \"near stock Android\" phones (Nexus S, Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G8, Moto G100) and I thought this would be a sure choice and a solid improvement, but I've read so many threads here of people complaining about #2 and #3 that I'm not sure I want to keep trying with this phone.Thanks in advance! \ud83e\udd17"},"218":{"post_title":"Your Google Store order was cancelled","self_text":"**Auto Cancellations:**  Last week, I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL with Preferred Care and a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, but 24 hours later, my order was automatically canceled.

I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8\/28.

They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.

I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.

Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.

Phone felt slightly warm while installing Android 15 but hasn't felt so while doing anything else like split screen GPS and music on 5G data which my previous phone struggled with. Haptic motor is impressive & I love the vibration patterns on the alarm tones. For the first time in my life, I can feel notification\/call vibrations when on vibrate mode.**Modem**: I had heard of the modem issues and my previous sim was quite old so I ordered a replacement sim for free when I ordered the phone to make sure that wouldn't hinder me. I am on voice calls during my work commute (London overground mostly) via WhatsApp or Google Meet and usually struggled with reception on the Redmi which is also a 4G device causing frustration on both ends of the call. On the Pixel I only had a network breakage once throughout the 40 minute route where the train goes underground for a few seconds. My mother was quite surprised when I pointed out I had reached work as there hadn't been any major breakages on call as usual.**Camera**I'm loving the camera, especially the telephoto lens. It does get a bit tricky to handle on zoom with shaky hands like mine. Here's an [album](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bHeykXh). The zoom is interesting. I can use the telephoto from the roadside to take pics of cool flowers in someone's driveway without getting close. But the macro mode isn't as good but I guess not a lot of people use it. Maybe I'm spoilt because the Redmi has a dedicated macro lens which is low MP but still takes solid shots. The lens change is very visible while in photos and in videos.And finally **battery**. I'll just put the numbers out here for you to see and draw your own conclusions.Day 1 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/FXLKdkM)) - 55% ootb battery used without charging to setup with 3hr 53min SOT and 1% left.Day 2 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/sLsmS9Y)) - Starting the day at 100% with Wi-Fi (65%) & Data (35%) of the time on a regular workday & gym routine. 6hr 26min SOT with 10% left.Updated to android 15 Beta overnight.Day 3 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/dtwCrxO)) - Full day at home on Wi-Fi. Long video calls. 9hr 13min SOT with 2% left.I'm assuming it could be either of the only Wi-Fi usage and android 15 upgrade could be the reason for the numbers on Day 3. I expect the numbers to improve over time.I hope this gives you a bit of an insight into my experience with the device. If there's anything I've missed, ask away and I'll try my best to answer it."},"224":{"post_title":"Pixel 8 feels underwhelming","self_text":"Edit: 50 comments is so many!! expected to get like one or two haha. Thanks all for your advice etc, it's calmed down a little now heat wise, and I do think this silly round boy will grow on me :)My Pixel 6 screen broke recently after three years of heavy use. I didn't want to spend \u00a3799 on the 9 when hardware updates seemed incremental, so I bought a new 8 for fairly cheap last week.All the UI bugs are still there. The phone gets warm really quick, from relatively minimal use. Charging speeds are _a snail's pace_ unless I turn the phone fully off (I'm assuming thermal throttling).This is my second Pixel 8, after buying one used and having the same experience. I assumed that was just its previous use, but all the issues are still present with the brand new one.It's mostly the heat problem that concerns me the most. It's literally always warm, even when typing this post. Is this a common issue for others also?"},"225":{"post_title":"Pixel 7 Pro review after almost 2 years of usage","self_text":"Before buying this phone, I was using a Galaxy S10. I received the Pixel on the 22nd of November 2022. In order to simplify this review, I will break it down into segments.1st- Build quality: (7 out of 10)The build quality is not bad by any means. However, the phone feels less rigid than the Galaxies and iPhones of the world. The glass to metal transition feels rough and not as smooth as other flagships. The volume rocker rattles, and when pushed at an angle pops up.2nd- Camera: (8.5\/10)Two years on and this camera system never ceases to amaze me. The stills I capture with this phone stack up nicely against current flagships, and beats them a lot of the time. But, and this is a big one, the videos coming out of this phone are disappointing. The sharppinning filter is through the roof, the exposure shifts are very noticeable. And the zooming transition is very choppy. 3rd- Display: (7.5 out of 10) Other than the excellent resolution, the display is mediocre. The first display I used, had a very apparent color shift to the color pink. When viewed from an angle, that is. The second screen shifts more towards blues. The compatibility with streaming apps is broken; the lowest brightness level in Netflix and amazon prime is blinding at night. The brightness under sunlight reached 1600 nits for 30 seconds and dims directly. Also it draws more power than competing flagships at the same brightness level.4th- Speakers: (5 out of 10)Lacks bass entirely. Flat. Imbalanced. Volume levels are not gradual. The only saving grace is that they don't distort at max volume.5th- Performance: (7 out of 10)For 1.5 years the phone kept on dropping frames left and right. Since March the phone feels snappy and very smooth. Gaming on the other hand is adequate. You start to notice the graphical limitations of Tensor real fast though. It also gets obscenely hot when doing anything.6th- Battery life: (6 out of 10)To put it simply, this battery is below adequate. Even for 2020 standards. It can barely reach 6 hours of SoT on wi-fi, and it really struggles to reach 4 hours on LTE\/5G. 7th- Software experience: (10 out of 10)No bloatware which is excellent. While customization is fairly limited, the theming is quite nice and organic. At glance widget and the songs identifying feature are excellent creature's comfort.Final rating: 7 out of 10.Hopefully the Pixel 9 Pro is a big improvement in these aspects."},"226":{"post_title":"Purchased a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold that has been stolen by delivery driver - Google refusing to help","self_text":"Posting on here as I\u2019m finding myself out of options.The short version is that I was waiting in for a new Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold today when the UK delivery company DPD updated me that the item had been delievered.The picture taken is clearly amongst other parcels, not my house.

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer.

It defaults to the podcast video unless otherwise specified.

While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"253":{"post_title":"Switched from iPhone 15 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro XL and holy moly it's fackin awesome!\n","self_text":"This is in response to this post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1ez8t91\/switched\\_from\\_iphone\\_15\\_pro\\_to\\_pixel\\_9\\_pro\\_xl\\_and\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1ez8t91\/switched_from_iphone_15_pro_to_pixel_9_pro_xl_and\/)  I did the same thing.

While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season!

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!  "},"259":{"post_title":"Just Upgraded from the Pixel 6 to Pixel 9 Pro XL, What a Difference!","self_text":"I've been a Pixel fan ever since the original Pixel XL. I was a Motorola Droid user before the Pixel series came out, and I fell in love with the simplicity of the original Pixel XL, the slick look, the fingerprint scanner, and the capability of the phone overall. I bought my Pixel XL in July of 2017, and kept it until the battery gave up in February of 2022, when I then got the Pixel 6. I was never really overly-happy with the 6, other than the size. I felt like the battery would drain really fast with minimal use, the camera was extremely disappointing, the phone itself felt really cheap, the camera shutter made a rattling noise every time my phone would move, I could go on. Because it worked however, I kept it. The battery finally died not too long ago, and I just went to T-Mobile to trade it in for a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Good lord, right off the bat, this phone FEELS far more premium, and more worth the price tag than the 6 ever did. I like the iPhone aesthetic the phone has going on with the rounded edges. I also love the nice, large screen. I know it's not significantly bigger than the 6, but it's still noticeable to me. I especially love the new camera spot, and the way that it's raised and protected by the aluminum body, as opposed to the all-glass camera on the 6. It also has a nice weight to it, not too crazy, but enough to know you have a high-end piece of tech in your hands.As for the software, the 9 operates like I think the 6 should have. It's very reminiscent of what it felt like to switch to the original Pixel XL from my cheap Droids. The animations are smooth, and I don't even have the smooth animation option on. The themes, stock wallpapers, even ringtones are excellent. The camera is also a HUGE improvement over the 6. I would take pictures of documents to scan them with my 6, and the picture would always come out looking like my lenses were smudged, and my astral photography always left something to be desired. The camera on the 9 Pro has been phenomenal. Close-up pictures are much more clear, and the options for getting the perfect shot are plentiful. I have not tried the astral photography settings on the 9 Pro yet, but I will be doing so as soon as there's a clear night and no moon. I will say, I don't believe that the 9 Pro camera is on par with the Samsung cameras, which are some of the best on the market, but it at least rivals, if not surpasses the camera on the iPhone.Overall, Google has dramatically improved the Pixel series from the 6. The 9 Pro has better battery life, smoother operation, an overall nicer look and more premium feel, and the camera actually lives up to the hype. As long as the battery has better longevity than the battery in the 6, I'm hoping to have this phone for at least as long as I had the original Pixel XL for. I feel like Google has outdone themselves with this phone!"},"260":{"post_title":"I\u2019ll be comparing the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and OnePlus 13 \u2013 Ask Me Anything!","self_text":"Hey everyone!I\u2019m about to receive my OnePlus 13 any moment now, and I\u2019ll be comparing it with the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"279":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Pixel 9 Pro Fold could be the name of Google's next foldable, not Fold 2","self_text":""},"280":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Review by MrMobile: \u201cThe End of the Beginning\u201d","self_text":""},"281":{"post_title":"[Exclusive] Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold price revealed; promo images show display size, AI features and more","self_text":""},"282":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold won't ship until September","self_text":""},"283":{"post_title":"Google officially confirms the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold will get an additional 2 years of OS updates","self_text":"The company has [updated a support page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-pixel-pro-xl-pixel-pro-fold%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold%2Cpixel-a-g-pixel-pixel-a-g-pixel-a-pixel-xl-pixel) to mention that these Pixel phones are guaranteed 5 years of updates - including 5 years of OS and security updates - starting from when they went on sale.This means the Pixel 6 series will get updates to Android 16 and Android 17, while the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold will get updates to Android 17 and Android 18.H\/T Nail Sadykov"},"284":{"post_title":"All Pixel 9 Pro upgrades over Pixel 9","self_text":"Below is the list of all the upgrades you get in the pro phone -1. 1mm extra screen size (insignificant)2.

My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling.

The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"310":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.  For some context, I\u2019ve owned many iPhones starting with the iPhone 3G, 4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/x\/12pm\/14pm etc as well as many Nokia phones (N8,N9,N95,N97,N97 Mini, Lumia series etc), BlackBerries and of course Android phones (HTCs, Nexus 4,5,6P,Pixel 2XL, Pixel 7P,8P and now 9P XL).This is just an appreciation post for the Pixel 9 Pro\u2026.  While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season! "},"311":{"post_title":"What are some things you didnt know your Google Pixel could do?","self_text":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"312":{"post_title":"All this Tensor hate is really annoying","self_text":"First of all, this is just my personal opinion. But all this Tensor hate really sucks. Just because the Tensor G4 can't quite keep up with the latest Snapdragon or Apple chip in benchmarks doesn't mean it's weak or a bad SoC. In fact, the Tensor G4 also offers flagship power and performance, and I'm pretty sure it won't have any problems with the 8-year update guarantee.In everyday use, Pixel phones with Tensor SoC run at least as smoothly as an iPhone or a flagship phone with a Snapdragon SoC. You will only notice a difference in specific use cases, for example when rendering a video. But is it really a big deal if your video does take a few seconds longer to render?In my opinion, Google is on the right track with its Tensor SoCs and much of the hate is unfounded.As I said, this is just my personal opinion.Thanks for reading - guess I'll take my down votes now - a happy Pixel 9 user."},"313":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 series price increase would've been better received if they had bumped up the base storage to 256 GB","self_text":"A lot of people seem unhappy about the price increases of the Pixel 9 phones, and rightfully so.

"},"318":{"post_title":"After 14 Years of iPhone, I Finally Switched to Android: My One-Month Review of the Pixel 9","self_text":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"319":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I\u2019ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I\u2019ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I\u2019ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any.

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."},"323":{"post_title":"Face Unlock on the Pixel 9 Pro is phenomenal","self_text":"It's instant, reliable, and now that it's a Class 3 Biometric (like Pixel 5 and 8 were), you can log into banking apps with it, and if you used face unlock to open your phone and then go to Google Wallet you don't have to re-authenticate to use a card. Just awesome, this is how it should be. The fact they can do it with a single camera is amazing."},"324":{"post_title":"Google refuses to start a return on a 8 PRO i bought 2 days ago.","self_text":"Last Update: I received a return label and I don't think it would of been possible without all the support from this post.

This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"348":{"post_title":"Android 15 will let you find your Pixel 8 even when it's off","self_text":""},"349":{"post_title":"Real-life pictures and specs of Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL","self_text":""},"350":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro smartphone review - The compact flagship with great cameras","self_text":""},"351":{"post_title":"Google officially confirms the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold will get an additional 2 years of OS updates","self_text":"The company has [updated a support page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-pixel-pro-xl-pixel-pro-fold%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold%2Cpixel-a-g-pixel-pixel-a-g-pixel-a-pixel-xl-pixel) to mention that these Pixel phones are guaranteed 5 years of updates - including 5 years of OS and security updates - starting from when they went on sale.This means the Pixel 6 series will get updates to Android 16 and Android 17, while the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold will get updates to Android 17 and Android 18.H\/T Nail Sadykov"},"352":{"post_title":"Confirmed: The Pixel 9 phones have a new modem, and that's a big deal","self_text":""},"353":{"post_title":"Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Google Pixel 9: You can\u2019t go wrong with either","self_text":""},"354":{"post_title":"The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Android Authority Editor's Choice winner for best phone of 2024","self_text":""},"355":{"post_title":"The Google Pixel 9 is a hit: Pixels earn double-digit market share for the first time\n","self_text":""},"356":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9\u2019s Tensor G4 chip isn\u2019t designed for speed or to beat benchmarks, says Google | Exclusive","self_text":""},"357":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Pixel 9 Buyers get Google One 2TB, Fitbit Premium & YouTube Premium included","self_text":""},"358":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google is finally adding an ultrasonic fingerprint reader to the Pixel 9","self_text":""},"359":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro wins Techradar Phone of the Year award","self_text":""},"360":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 phones don't support Qi2 charging, and Google told us why [Qi2 has \"no tangible benefits, weaker availability\"]","self_text":""},"361":{"post_title":"Poll result: The Tensor G4 is a Pixel 9 dealbreaker for many","self_text":""},"362":{"post_title":"So why is the Pixel 9 series more expensive?","self_text":""},"363":{"post_title":"128GB baseline storage for the Pixel 9 Pro XL feels stingy, huh?","self_text":""},"364":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro reportedly costs Google around $400 in materials to make","self_text":""},"365":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review","self_text":""},"366":{"post_title":"Android will no longer call slow chargers 'fast,' but only on Pixel 9 so far","self_text":""},"367":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel 9\u2019s Tensor G4 is the smallest upgrade to the series so far","self_text":""},"368":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: The longest battery life we've ever recorded","self_text":""},"369":{"post_title":"Introducing the Google Pixel 9 Pro","self_text":""},"370":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 leak reveals Tensor G4 specs, benchmarks","self_text":""},"371":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro review - GSMArena.com tests","self_text":""},"372":{"post_title":"Why is Google launching the Pixel 9 so early?","self_text":""},"373":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 - A Long Term User Review - Hardware Canucks","self_text":""},"374":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro is the small Android phone I've been waiting for - Android Authority","self_text":""},"375":{"post_title":"Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold leak reveals European prices, colors","self_text":""},"376":{"post_title":"December Pixel Drop: New features for your Pixel phone, Tablet and more","self_text":""},"377":{"post_title":"Android 15 could let your Pixel Watch control your phone's media output","self_text":""},"378":{"post_title":"Google Pixel Watch 5 might be getting a custom Tensor chip \/ After five generations of Tensor-based phones, Google might also be putting a custom chip in its smartwatches.","self_text":""},"379":{"post_title":"Sources: Pixel Watch 3 will have 45mm size, Pixel Buds Pro 2 also coming","self_text":""},"380":{"post_title":"First-gen Pixel Buds Pro are now getting Gemini support","self_text":"Last week, Google sent out an email stating that Gemini will be \"coming soon\" to the Pixel Buds, and it's [now rolling out to some users](https:\/\/ibb.co\/album\/cXNKTD).

Here are the results.","self_text":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"386":{"post_title":"I just put a PebbleBee and an Apple Air Tracker in a box and am mailing it to a family member a few states away to test the Android Find My Device capabilities.","self_text":"I did a local test around town today to see if our nely arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens. *Update 1* July 3rdAfter the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.*Update 2* July 4As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.*Update 3* July 5I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.*Update 4*  July 6The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.*Conclusion*It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future."},"387":{"post_title":"One of the areas that is often overlooked with modern smartphones that are equipped with bigger camera sensors is the quality of lenses, and the blur they produce","self_text":"Quality of blur is a bit of a pet peeve of mine and I don't ever seem to see it mentioned by reviewers on YouTube, or even websites like GSMArena. Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"388":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"389":{"post_title":"Are Pixel and OnePlus the only real alternatives to Samsung Galaxy?","self_text":"I've been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time, but I'm tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone (though they're fine with doing that on their tablets?).I want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile, but that's just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phone.I don't want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products (and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds), but it really doesn't look like adding multiple profile options is something they're going to do.But it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone, so I think I'm going to have to choose which one I want more.

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails.

Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"},"393":{"post_title":"I think for the first time, I cannot think of a single realistic feature I would want from a smartphone","self_text":"Just like I imagine most tech enthusiasts, I have my list of criteria for what I would consider to be my \"perfect smartphone\". Slim bezels, a high frequency screen, a flat screen, faster storage, a fast and efficient SoC, enough RAM, great battery life, fast charging, wireless charging, good connectivity chips (BT, Wi-Fi, 5G, GPS), good cameras, water-dust resistance, good unlocking tech, Type-C, SIM + eSIM, good audio codes, etc. Before, whenever a new phone would come out I would check its specs out, and there was always something that was not quite up to scratch, be it thicker, uneven bezels, or a slow storage, it was pretty much always back to \"This is almost perfect, but wait for the next year's model\". But for 2025, I think for the first time I have absolutely nothing that I could realistically wish for in a smartphone. For example, I just checked out OnePlus 13. That phone has it all. If I had to nitpick, I would say it needs better cameras, but what it currently has is fine too. Even in 2024, the phone specs were already there, the only things I was not happy with was the base storage still starting at 128GB for some smartphones and the lack of ubiquitous UWB. Samsung also used Exynos for Europe in their Galaxy S24 phones which I would not get. For 2025 though, the base storage *should* start at 256GB with UFS 4.0 and UWB should be more available too. All flagships that will come out will be more than enough, I wonder how they will even differentiate themselves. Now, not to offend anyone, but there are some specs that I would consider as fantasy specs right now, features such as: a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSD slot, an IR blaster. And I would not expect them. So, for me, the specs are there. Which I am quite happy with, I love when a technology overtakes my wants. There is nothing else I can even really think of what I would want in a smartphone conceptually. Maybe a full screen fingerprint reader? Two USB Type-C ports? I still wish for a true mini flagship smartphone. But, that again, is probably unrealistic.Is there anything where the current smartphones are quite there for you? What would you like, realistically?"},"394":{"post_title":"What keeps you on Android in 2024?","self_text":"Honest question. I\u2019ve spent years on both Android and iOS, but I\u2019ve leaned more towards iOS is the past 5 years for sure. The reason I ask is because Android is starting to intrigue me again after being on iOS this long. I\u2019ve used both extensively over the years, and I really miss playing around with my phone and truly making it mine, mostly with Nova Launcher, icon packs and wallpapers. But, there\u2019s reasons why Apple does so well. For me, it\u2019s utility. My phone is a communication device well before it\u2019s a toy these days, and in recent years I\u2019ve just felt that the iPhone does a better job at communication (iMessage being a huge deal breaker for me). I was a big BlackBerry fan before this, that\u2019s how important communication was to me. In fact, one of the last Android devices I had was the BlackBerry Key2. The physical keyboard had so many functional benefits. Anyways, here\u2019s my brief list for why I\u2019ve stayed with my iPhone in recent years. Please feel free to share why you agree or disagree, I low key want to be persuaded into getting an S24 Ultra \ud83d\ude021. iMessageEasily the biggest reason. Some people don\u2019t see it as a big deal, I do. I live in Canada. Almost everyone I know has an iPhone. I hate when I text someone with a green bubble. It\u2019s like, did they get my message? Can I send them the video I just took of my dog without it looking choppy? Oh it\u2019s a 1 minute video, ya forget it. Oh I wanna FaceTime my friend quick\u2026 oh wait, they\u2019re the green bubble friend, never mind. Okay I need to start a group chat to plan my dad\u2019s 60th birthday party. Oh wait, that friend I have to text separately. There\u2019s so many reasons why iMessage is great! Yes, WhatsApp works great, but not everyone has it, and it\u2019s an extra step to get everyone to download it. I also find that video files get compressed in WhatsApp and show up blurry. With iMessage, things look exactly how they were shot on my phone. I hate that the iPhone fans are right about this one because most of them haven\u2019t given Android a chance like I have, but they are. iMessage works so good and it\u2019s still not matched yet. 2. Ecosystem IntegrationYes, I own a MacBook Air, AirPods, and Apple Watch. They all work great, and they\u2019ve all become routine parts of my life. This is far less important to me than iMessage\/Facetime though. I could probably find some other earphones or smartwatch that I like on Android. 3. App SupportApps are generally prioritized for the iPhone, and years ago I would see countless examples of an iPhone app running smoother than its Android counterpart. Not sure if that\u2019s still the case.4. Apple PayAlways works flawlessly. Reasons I absolutely LOVE Android:1. Customization - Self explanatory 2. Freedom - I love how an Android device feels more like a computer. Mostly with file management, side loading capabilities etc. I just feel like where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way on these phones. 3. Hardware choice - This isn\u2019t as important to me because I almost always have opted for Samsung or Pixel devices, but usually Samsung. The Pixels feel too iPhoney to me. 4. Cool Factor - There\u2019s just always a cool party trick you can do with your Android that you can\u2019t with your iPhone "},"395":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"396":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

On Android we have something similar called \"Quick Share\" but nobody knows about it, nobody knows that they can send and receive things through it; in fact I even hear some people say things like \"I wish Android had its own \"Air Drop\"I think this happens because Apple is very good at publicizing the features and functions of its products but Google and other Android brands do not know how to do it as well, they have to better advertise the functions of their products; and this not only happens with Quick Share, but with other functions such as Circle to Search on the Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S22 and higher that even if everyone has their phones updated and with all those functions, they do not know that they have them and therefore do not use them."},"401":{"post_title":"Google officially confirms the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold will get an additional 2 years of OS updates","self_text":"The company has [updated a support page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-pixel-pro-xl-pixel-pro-fold%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold%2Cpixel-a-g-pixel-pixel-a-g-pixel-a-pixel-xl-pixel) to mention that these Pixel phones are guaranteed 5 years of updates - including 5 years of OS and security updates - starting from when they went on sale.This means the Pixel 6 series will get updates to Android 16 and Android 17, while the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold will get updates to Android 17 and Android 18.H\/T Nail Sadykov"},"402":{"post_title":"128GB baseline storage for the Pixel 9 Pro XL feels stingy, huh?","self_text":""},"403":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review","self_text":""},"404":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: The longest battery life we've ever recorded","self_text":""},"405":{"post_title":"Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold leak reveals European prices, colors","self_text":""},"406":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra","self_text":""},"407":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL vs iPhone 15 Pro Max vs S24 Ultra - Heavy Workload Test","self_text":""},"408":{"post_title":"Ice Universe on X: \"The S25 Ultra will be the thinnest and lightest of all Ultra flagship phones to be released soon, including iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pixel 9 Pro XL.\"","self_text":""},"409":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"410":{"post_title":"Real-life pictures and specs of Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL","self_text":""},"411":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is one of the top 10 premium phones in the US","self_text":""},"412":{"post_title":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\"","self_text":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\" but will be coming to more high-end devices in the near future according to Terence Zhang, a Developer Relations engineer at Google, [during #TheAndroidShow](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pou4o1X1DI4).The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have the same chipset (Tensor G3) but different amounts of memory (8GB versus 12GB).

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Thanks!"},"427":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"428":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"429":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android.

The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Turns out, Verizon has a sneaky \"feature\" on their business accounts that **blocks RCS by default**.**The Fix:**1. Contact your Verizon business account admin.2. Have them log into the account dashboard.3. There's a setting called \"Block RCS\" (or something similar). **Make sure it's turned OFF.**Boom! RCS instantly connected for me after that.

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model.

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"433":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early.

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me \/ Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP\/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?"},"435":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to!

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."},"439":{"post_title":"This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"440":{"post_title":"What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?","self_text":"I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI\/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit\/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit\/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI\/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in \"flagship\" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the \"old\" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the \"normal\" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water\/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \\*trying\\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have \"extra space\" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a \"flagship\" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit\/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit\/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit\/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a \"flagship\" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for \"security concerns\" (which are valid, except that these \"security concerns\" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta\/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN\/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN\/password is entered, the orientation\/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often\/with what parameters you need to use a PIN\/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI\/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom\/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom\/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel), navigation bars, \"recent apps\" screens, or other integral UI\/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called \"navbar\") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show\/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides\/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel) (the app I use is called \"oneshade\") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \\*mostly\\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \\*can\\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort\/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point\/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a \"flagship\" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with \"flagship\" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a \"flagship\" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior\/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the \"solution\" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory \"capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first\" to the theory of \"this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things\" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules\/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."},"441":{"post_title":"What I miss as a new Pixel user - Any suggestions?","self_text":"I am new to Pixel and recently got a new Pixel 8a, and generally, I love it. It's extremely smooth and fast in comparison to my aging Oppo A91.

I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting the screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly, you have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on\/off the device.** This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega\/giga bytes consumed per day.** I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.**\u00a0This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app?

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"453":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"454":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3.

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"456":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder\u2019s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"},"457":{"post_title":"How I Organized My Google Pixel 9 Home Screens for Functionality and Aesthetic (Only Using It's Internal Settings, No Screen-Apps)","self_text":"My Google Pixel 9 layout is meticulously designed to reflect my needs, interests, and a desire for clean, purposeful organization.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"460":{"post_title":"My wish list for the perfect phone","self_text":"6.2\" size120 Hz bright LTPO OLED s24 antiglare screen glassOnePlus 13 Aqua Touch 2.0camera and processing from Pixel pro 9 video quality of the iPhone 16 prosnapdragon 8 elite chip 16gb of fast ram6000+ mAh battery 512, 1000 and 2000gb for storage options (ufs4)USB 4 and 75watt fast chargingQi2 charging but 25wattshoulder buttons for shortcuts and emulationface and fingerprint unlock"},"461":{"post_title":"Android VS iPhone.

Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life \/ wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life\/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean\/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc \/ payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good.

Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings.

If they don't, they're going to be too far away and outdated compared to the competition. For example, Google with the Pixel 9 updated all its camera sensors and now all the sensors in the Pixels are 50 Megapixels; for example, the main sensor of the camera went from being a Samsung GN2 sensor to the new Samsung GNK.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"464":{"post_title":"Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25","self_text":"Alongside updates to [Gemini](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/) and [Circle to Search](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https:\/\/www.resound.com\/en-us\/) and [Oticon Intent](https:\/\/www.oticon.com\/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."},"465":{"post_title":"Xiaomi 14 Pro is an extremely underrated phone.","self_text":"I sell phones as a little side hustle and get to try all the top Flagships in the United States.

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"468":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color.

All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"474":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"475":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release.

It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now.

I used it for awhile, enjoying the new features. But then I found out I can't select text in a text message? Fucking what? Turns out this has been an issue for pixel enjoyers for a long time. Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it. Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps. I'd be losing my fucking mind otherwise lol. Samsung messages also allows you to create folders, which is so handy for separating spam\/auto messages from important numbers.

"},"477":{"post_title":"Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment]","self_text":"I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.Usecase 1) -\u00a0**Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -**\u00a0I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away.\u00a0***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.***\u00a0I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread -\u00a0[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1)Usecase 2) -\u00a0**Standardized gestures to move back -**\u00a0iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page\/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen\/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.Usecase 3) -\u00a0**Selecting files\/images -**\u00a0Selecting multiple images\/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.Usecase 4) -\u00a0**Blocking spam message senders -**\u00a0Most of us get probably dozens of spam\/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks\/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.Usecase 5) -\u00a0**View images\/documents on Files app -**\u00a0Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page -\u00a0[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/255068777?sortBy=best](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/255068777?sortBy=best)It seems to be happening on ipads as well.So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience.

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD\/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

The content remains the same\u2014just easier to follow. If you would rather see my poorly written review DM me lol. Original post:I was initially skeptical of the widespread criticism surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but after receiving my 1TB model, I quickly understood the frustration. I had planned to trade in my Galaxy S22 for $600, expecting a substantial upgrade. However, after testing the S25 Ultra, I found the differences to be minimal\u2014certain aspects even felt like a downgrade.Underwhelming Improvements for a Premium PriceWith a starting price of $1,400, I expected significant enhancements, but the S25 Ultra left me unimpressed. The phone doesn\u2019t feel noticeably faster, and the cameras actually seem to perform worse than previous models. The macro photography, which I was particularly excited about, was a letdown\u2014my old Note 5 captured better close-up shots. Additionally, Samsung removed Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, reducing its versatility.Samsung\u2019s AI Promises Were MisleadingSamsung heavily marketed AI as the defining feature of the S25 Ultra, claiming during its launch event that all AI processing could be done locally on the device. This turned out to be misleading. Even after enabling the \"local AI\" setting to keep data on-device, I found that many features still required cloud access to function. This raises privacy concerns and contradicts Samsung\u2019s core marketing message.AI and Image Generation Fell FlatBeyond the misleading AI claims, the phone\u2019s generative image features were disappointing. Samsung positioned AI as the main selling point of the S25 Ultra, yet the execution feels rushed and underdeveloped. Instead of true AI innovation, it seems like Samsung is simply riding the AI hype train without delivering a meaningful user experience.Not Enough to Justify the Price TagAt $1,400 and up, the S25 Ultra needed to bring substantial improvements, but it doesn\u2019t. This release feels more like an incremental iPhone-style update\u2014something unexpected from Samsung, which was once known for pushing boundaries. Rather than innovating, they seem to be cutting corners while relying on AI buzzwords.For the first time ever, I\u2019m returning a Samsung device.

I\u2019ve spent years on both Android and iOS, but I\u2019ve leaned more towards iOS is the past 5 years for sure. The reason I ask is because Android is starting to intrigue me again after being on iOS this long. I\u2019ve used both extensively over the years, and I really miss playing around with my phone and truly making it mine, mostly with Nova Launcher, icon packs and wallpapers. But, there\u2019s reasons why Apple does so well. For me, it\u2019s utility. My phone is a communication device well before it\u2019s a toy these days, and in recent years I\u2019ve just felt that the iPhone does a better job at communication (iMessage being a huge deal breaker for me). I was a big BlackBerry fan before this, that\u2019s how important communication was to me. In fact, one of the last Android devices I had was the BlackBerry Key2. The physical keyboard had so many functional benefits. Anyways, here\u2019s my brief list for why I\u2019ve stayed with my iPhone in recent years. Please feel free to share why you agree or disagree, I low key want to be persuaded into getting an S24 Ultra \ud83d\ude021. iMessageEasily the biggest reason. Some people don\u2019t see it as a big deal, I do. I live in Canada. Almost everyone I know has an iPhone. I hate when I text someone with a green bubble. It\u2019s like, did they get my message? Can I send them the video I just took of my dog without it looking choppy? Oh it\u2019s a 1 minute video, ya forget it. Oh I wanna FaceTime my friend quick\u2026 oh wait, they\u2019re the green bubble friend, never mind. Okay I need to start a group chat to plan my dad\u2019s 60th birthday party. Oh wait, that friend I have to text separately. There\u2019s so many reasons why iMessage is great! Yes, WhatsApp works great, but not everyone has it, and it\u2019s an extra step to get everyone to download it. I also find that video files get compressed in WhatsApp and show up blurry. With iMessage, things look exactly how they were shot on my phone. I hate that the iPhone fans are right about this one because most of them haven\u2019t given Android a chance like I have, but they are. iMessage works so good and it\u2019s still not matched yet. 2. Ecosystem IntegrationYes, I own a MacBook Air, AirPods, and Apple Watch. They all work great, and they\u2019ve all become routine parts of my life. This is far less important to me than iMessage\/Facetime though. I could probably find some other earphones or smartwatch that I like on Android. 3. App SupportApps are generally prioritized for the iPhone, and years ago I would see countless examples of an iPhone app running smoother than its Android counterpart. Not sure if that\u2019s still the case.4. Apple PayAlways works flawlessly. Reasons I absolutely LOVE Android:1. Customization - Self explanatory 2. Freedom - I love how an Android device feels more like a computer. Mostly with file management, side loading capabilities etc. I just feel like where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way on these phones. 3. Hardware choice - This isn\u2019t as important to me because I almost always have opted for Samsung or Pixel devices, but usually Samsung. The Pixels feel too iPhoney to me. 4. Cool Factor - There\u2019s just always a cool party trick you can do with your Android that you can\u2019t with your iPhone "},"481":{"post_title":"How to convince google to be serious about biometric authentication to stop thieves?","self_text":"I'm from Brazil and thieves force you to tell your PIN with a gun to your head then take your phone. Android always allows for the fingerprint to be bypassed by the PIN so there's no way to protect from this. Also they get into your messaging apps and start asking relatives for money, not to mention looking for photos for extortion. People's bank accounts are being drained. Android Identity Check is nice but much more needs to be done to enforce biometric only unlock of the phone and let people lock apps with biometric authentication easily. But most importantly, it needs to be convenient otherwise people will not use for everyday apps like Whatsapp.On iOS it's possible to lock all apps with Face ID which is more convenient because you can switch between them all day and you don't even notice face id is there. On Android people would only lock some apps but today our information is all in WhatsApp which no one would put behind a fingerprint because they use it all day. Android should use AI to detect faces if it does not want to include 3D face scanning like Face ID, but it needs it.Also apps should be able to enforce biometric only authentication if they want, something which is not possible today. Also prevent phone calls to be answered with the phone locked as 2FA codes can be received over phone calls.  Android meeds much better al security against thieves by enforcing biometric only authentication but google seems to not care much about this, or maybe manufacturers as well ehich never implemented face scanning technology. Is there a way to convince google? Samsung? Can this reach a google employee eith power to change?"},"482":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"483":{"post_title":"System apps that could be uninstalled without breaking any functionality in Samsung devices","self_text":"I was trying to debloat my Samsung A14 5G device without root using [Canta](https:\/\/github.com\/samolego\/Canta) and [Shizuku](https:\/\/github.com\/RikkaApps\/Shizuku).

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder. These four apps are exclusive to Samsung devices, and their extensions enable the following actions to be taken:*   **Samsung Calendar**    *   Create, edit, and delete events on your calendar    *   Capture info from images to create events    *   List events for a date range and create repeating events*   **Samsung Clock**    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show alarms    *   Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch    *   Create, delete, find, update, and show timers*   **Samsung Notes**    *   Create and summarize notes    *   Retrieve your notes based on descriptions and titles*   **Samsung Reminder**    *   Create reminders for a specific time or date    *   Edit a reminder\u2019s name, time or date    *   Search for reminders by name, time or date    *   Delete reminders"},"485":{"post_title":"OnePlus unveils OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15, here are 10 of its new features","self_text":"OnePlus will roll out OxygenOS 15 ([based on Android 15](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgB98WkAAmjUM?format=jpg&name=large)) to the OnePlus 12 next week, and here are 10 new features in the new release:  1) There's a [new split notification shade](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgHZwXsAArz8P?format=jpg&name=large) \u2026 but it is optional! OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you\u2019re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I\u2019ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it\u2019s easy to switch between the two.2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!3) Circle to Search, my beloved! [OxygenOS 15 brings Google\u2019s Circle to Search feature](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgOP6XMAAQHEb?format=jpg&name=large) to OnePlus phones, finally.4) New animations throughout the OS, including for pulling down the notifications panel, charging your phone, launching an app, or unlocking via fingerprint. There are also now new fade-in\/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass\/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It\u2019ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it\u2019ll basically let you ask questions like \u201chow much is my next phone bill?\u201d and then it\u2019ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing\u2026but honestly it seems like it\u2019s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently?

Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.For a full price handset of \u00a31100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. Here's the obvious reasons why:- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.- Excellent phone reception and sound quality\/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3\/4\/5G to boost your base voice call quality too- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour- While Samsung S24 series have \"circle to search\", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera\/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)However, here's the bits that could be better:- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications - Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer\/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get."},"490":{"post_title":"Why is it that almost everyone who uses Android phones doesn't know about \"Quick Share\"?","self_text":"Let me explain, everyone, absolutely everyone who uses an iPhone knows that their devices have an option to send and receive things that is called, in Apple's case, \"Air Drop\". On Android we have something similar called \"Quick Share\" but nobody knows about it, nobody knows that they can send and receive things through it; in fact I even hear some people say things like \"I wish Android had its own \"Air Drop\"I think this happens because Apple is very good at publicizing the features and functions of its products but Google and other Android brands do not know how to do it as well, they have to better advertise the functions of their products; and this not only happens with Quick Share, but with other functions such as Circle to Search on the Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S22 and higher that even if everyone has their phones updated and with all those functions, they do not know that they have them and therefore do not use them."},"491":{"post_title":"The Pixel Launcher is starting to roll out a new \"search engine\" settings page","self_text":"This page lets you change the search provider used for the search bar on the home screen.One user tells me they received a notification from the Search Engine Selector app to choose their search engine.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"493":{"post_title":"My experience with the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem","self_text":"I was curious how well the integrations between phone and laptop would work, so I decided to test all of the relevant ecosystem apps and features. I\u2019ve included a description of each app\/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn\u2019t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn\u2019t able to get notes to sync reliably. It\u2019s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can\u2019t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn\u2019t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/office\/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn\u2019t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It\u2019s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn\u2019t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn\u2019t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google\u2019s desktop Quick Share app](https:\/\/www.android.com\/intl\/en_ca\/better-together\/quick-share-app\/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there\u2019s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren\u2019t. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It\u2019s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on\/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works. It makes sense since those are all Chromium-based browsers."},"494":{"post_title":"Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here's everything you need to know!","self_text":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"496":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"497":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3.

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"500":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"501":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true.

My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"502":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "},"503":{"post_title":"Android should really change how it works","self_text":"As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn\u2019t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting\u2014the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument."},"504":{"post_title":"ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro - Buyer Beware","self_text":"Let me know if this needs to go elsewhere, but after doing quite a bit of searching here and across the web, there aren't many places to actually leave reviews for this device, including ASUS' own site. I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"},"505":{"post_title":"This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"506":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!   "},"507":{"post_title":"Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions","self_text":"I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https:\/\/oukitel.com\/products\/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the \"Force full GNSS measurements\" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood\/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone."},"508":{"post_title":"A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus","self_text":"In case it matters, I'm in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends\/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided \"No Samsung\" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's \"Smart Panel\" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."},"509":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Review: The End of the Beginning - MrMobile","self_text":""},"510":{"post_title":"Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here's everything you need to know!","self_text":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Turns out, Verizon has a sneaky \"feature\" on their business accounts that **blocks RCS by default**.**The Fix:**1. Contact your Verizon business account admin.2. Have them log into the account dashboard.3. There's a setting called \"Block RCS\" (or something similar). **Make sure it's turned OFF.**Boom! RCS instantly connected for me after that. Hope this saves someone else the headache I went through.Edit: Sharing this as there is absolutely no information about this anywhere including Verizon support or Google support."},"513":{"post_title":"Made by Google 2024 event mega thread","self_text":"[Keynote live stream ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N_y2tP9of8A)[The made by Google after party Livestream ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cWGt2ybsVMk)[Made by Google 2024 blog post](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/platforms-devices\/made-by-google-2024-collection\/)[Meet Pixel Buds Pro 2, the first Buds built for Gemini](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-buds-pro-2\/)[Introducing Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Google's newest foldable phone](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-pro-fold\/)[9 things to know about Pixel 9 cameras](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-ai-camera-features\/)[The new Pixel 9 phones bring you the best of Google AI](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-pro-xl\/)[Loss of Pulse Detection: A first-of-its-kind feature on Pixel Watch 3](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection\/)[Google Pixel Watch 3: bigger, brighter, fine-tuned for fitness](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-watch-3\/)[4 new AI-powered Pixel and Android accessibility updates](https:\/\/blog.google\/outreach-initiatives\/accessibility\/google-pixel-camera-accessibility-update-2024\/)[14 new things you can do with Pixel thanks to AI](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features\/)[Android is reimagining your phone with Gemini](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/android\/android-gemini-google-ai\/)***Pixel lineup:*****Pixel 9**[Google Pixel 9 unveiled: Here's all the details of the new Google phones - android faithful](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/google-pixel-9\/)[Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold: What a Gemini - Joshua Vergara](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uAs8iJoGDos)[Google Pixel 9 Pro: AI that ACTUALLY WORKS?

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology.

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"516":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"517":{"post_title":"Here's everything that's new in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2","self_text":"# What's available right now  * The top-level Settings homepage redesign that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) is [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sWk5RxGP)  * The keyboard quick switcher feature that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-keyboard-switcher-revamp-3475688\/) is also [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sd0qyPhE)  * Another feature that [I previously reported on](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-screen-recording-chips-3474411\/) is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [new status bar chips for screen recording\/screen casting.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sp6myIx8)  * Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [partial\/compact heads-up notifications layout](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tMN0RLaH) that I [previously reported about!](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061\/)  * The [color correction intensity slider](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tg0dR7Da) that I [previously reported about](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-color-correction-slider-3458931\/) is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2!

My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color.

All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data.  * **Offline Device Lock** automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time.  * **Remote Lock** lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil.

Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"528":{"post_title":"Fast charging is fucking amazing!!","self_text":"I just got the Pixel 7 Pro and this is the first \"new\" phone I've ever had. All my other phones have always been 3-5 year old hand me downs, I was finally in a position to be able to afford a nice one and damn I love it so much. Whenever I see the words \"charging rapidly\" I get a huge burst of dopamine, and don't even get me started on the speed of the phone.

All I said was the words \"charging rapidly\" gives me dopamine and I've had 10 people tell me how slow my phone charges. Is this a toxic community?

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3.

Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**.

Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"},"533":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"534":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.For a full price handset of \u00a31100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. Here's the obvious reasons why:- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.- Excellent phone reception and sound quality\/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3\/4\/5G to boost your base voice call quality too- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour- While Samsung S24 series have \"circle to search\", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera\/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)However, here's the bits that could be better:- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications - Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer\/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get."},"537":{"post_title":"Starlink satellite messaging support is rolling out to the Pixel 9","self_text":"Looks like T-Mobile and Starlink are starting to let some Pixel 9 users into the satellite messaging beta.Just heard from two Pixel 9 Pro XL users that they were invited to the beta.

Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"539":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"540":{"post_title":"My experience with the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem","self_text":"I was curious how well the integrations between phone and laptop would work, so I decided to test all of the relevant ecosystem apps and features. I\u2019ve included a description of each app\/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn\u2019t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn\u2019t able to get notes to sync reliably. It\u2019s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can\u2019t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn\u2019t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/office\/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn\u2019t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It\u2019s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn\u2019t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn\u2019t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google\u2019s desktop Quick Share app](https:\/\/www.android.com\/intl\/en_ca\/better-together\/quick-share-app\/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there\u2019s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren\u2019t. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It\u2019s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on\/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works.

But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life \/ wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life\/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean\/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc \/ payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try.

Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue.

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"545":{"post_title":"Finally got a Desktop Mode working!!","self_text":"Thanks to the new version of scrcpy and Android 15!

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"563":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"566":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to!

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."},"568":{"post_title":"Those who are equally Samsung and Google fans, which is the more fun option?

"},"569":{"post_title":"This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"570":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"573":{"post_title":"Fast charging is fucking amazing!!","self_text":"I just got the Pixel 7 Pro and this is the first \"new\" phone I've ever had.

"},"574":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"575":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all.

"},"577":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"578":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"579":{"post_title":"Thinking a little bit about the future Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus ","self_text":"I explain: I am a dual user of a Galaxy S22 Plus. I live in the USA and therefore here the Galaxy of the series \"S\" are all released with the Snapdragon of the series 8 of the year; that means that the Galaxy S25 here will come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 with its new Oryon cores  The Galaxy S25 strikes me to buy them as they will use those new Snapdragon with totally new architecture, but it is not the only change I expect. since the S22, the 3 sensors of the camera have not changed at all and all the improvements have come via processing and software, but there are already 3 generations with the same camera sensors and it would be ridiculous from my point of view that they did not update them for the new S25 and S25 Plus. If they don't, they're going to be too far away and outdated compared to the competition. For example, Google with the Pixel 9 updated all its camera sensors and now all the sensors in the Pixels are 50 Megapixels; for example, the main sensor of the camera went from being a Samsung GN2 sensor to the new Samsung GNK. I think if the S25 and S25 Plus do not update at least the main sensor of the camera, I will not buy it. "},"580":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"582":{"post_title":"Here's everything that's new in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2","self_text":"# What's available right now  * The top-level Settings homepage redesign that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) is [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sWk5RxGP)  * The keyboard quick switcher feature that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-keyboard-switcher-revamp-3475688\/) is also [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sd0qyPhE)  * Another feature that [I previously reported on](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-screen-recording-chips-3474411\/) is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [new status bar chips for screen recording\/screen casting.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sp6myIx8)  * Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [partial\/compact heads-up notifications layout](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tMN0RLaH) that I [previously reported about!](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061\/)  * The [color correction intensity slider](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tg0dR7Da) that I [previously reported about](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-color-correction-slider-3458931\/) is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2!

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"584":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!   "},"585":{"post_title":"Xiaomi 13T Pro Review (South Europe) ","self_text":"Backstory: I was an iPhone guy for a well until I enlisted in the army and decided to get a cheap phone with me because in training especially I was afraid I would break the expensive iPhone. Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"586":{"post_title":"Is Huawei worth it after this new GMS method came out?","self_text":"I'm a huge Chrome,YouTube, Play Store & Social Media user but I'm impressed by Huawei phones especially the Pura 70, i wasn't planning to buy from Huawei despite loving it because of the lack of GMS. However, i found out that an app called MicroG came out that lets you install and use google apps quite natively, so this made me rethink if i should buy from Huawei or not.The lack of Google Assistant isn't a big deal to me and i don't care about the lack of Google Pay because i can use my other Android device to make payments.So the question is: after this nice new method to use google apps on it, is the Pura 70 worth it over S24 or Pixel 9 if i love the Pura 70 design the most?Note: planning to buy a Tablet and Earbuds afterwards that must be from the same company."}}}
