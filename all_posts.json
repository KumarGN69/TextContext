Tested performed using the same Pixel Buds Pro earbuds and Pixel A series Buds.  Spatial Audio disabled.Apps used: Spotify, Apple Music, Pocketcasts, Antenna Pod**Result**:  Flawless bluetooth sound quality on Pixel 8 series.  Pixel 9 series lower sound quality, issues with Equalizer function and constant interference and crackling sounds.**Sound Quality**: Equalizer function in both Apple Music and Spotify decreases sound quality\/volume in the Pixel 9 series (9 and 9 Pro). On switching the Equalizer ON -  the sound volume actually goes way down. The only way to fix it is to hit the Surround button on the Equalizer drag it to zero.  Keep repeating that until sound increases.  It will again flip back to lower volume, and you have to fiddle with the Surround sound setting again.The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are flawless and have better sound quality and ofcourse no volume decrease using the Equalizer.**Bluetooth Interference and Sound Cutting Out:**   Using both the podcast apps, the sound keeps cutting out intermittently on the 9 Series.  There is also cracking sound many times with volume levels going up and down.  The only way to fix this is to reboot the phone.   Happens quite frequently especially when the phone is in the pocket or covered.Does anyone know whether these are software bugs or are BOTH my Pixel 9 series phones defective?

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"5":{"post_title":"Ordered a Pixel 9 Pro from the Google Store, and they sent me an EMPTY box.

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"},"10":{"post_title":"A 128GB Pixel 9 Pro should never exist, Google","self_text":""},"11":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Can't receive nudes via rcs\/sms?","self_text":"Title says it allThe girl I'm seeing at the moment was a bit upset with me today, given I hadn't responded to her spontaneous spicy pictures she's sent my way    I (*after reassuring her that I was in fact very appreciative of the gesture*) was very confused and showed her no eye cady had been received    We ran some tests together after having a laugh, and found out that my Pixel 9 Pro won't receive any nude pictures via google messages, but other messaging services like whatsapp and facebook messenger seem fine?

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"16":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL to start at $1,099 as more leaks confirm specs and AI features","self_text":""},"17":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.

I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.

As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I\u2019ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition \u2014 it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! \ud83d\udc4fAnyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences? Drop a comment \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your stories!"},"34":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro: New Report Reveals Bundled Offer Worth $240","self_text":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/paulmonckton\/2024\/07\/27\/pixel-9-pro-new-report-reveals-bundled-offer-worth-240\/"},"35":{"post_title":"I have half a dozen USB-C chargers in my house \u2014 none of them charge the Pixel 9 Pro XL at full speed","self_text":""},"36":{"post_title":" From Google Pixel 7 pro to Google Pixel 9 pro XL , my thoughts and opinion if anyone is considering switching.","self_text":"I went from a P7Pro to a P9Pro XLAfter using it for 1 week now here are some observations that might help anyone considering switching.1 - DesignI personally love the 9 design, the 7 pro is not bad but I never really liked the classic pixel camera, always looked pretty fugly to me and not really premium looking. So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"37":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro Best Buy Test: Holy crap this telephoto lens!!!11one","self_text":"Pixel 9 Pro XL at Best Buy: OMG the Telephoto is Amazing------------------**Disclaimer:** Quick Share on these devices was disabled so I had no way to get photos off. I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."},"38":{"post_title":"I just saw someone still using a Pixel 2 ","self_text":"I recognized it immediately by the rear fingerprint scanner and out-of-color power button.

Granted, it was in a coffee shop and dude was seated a little closer to the window but still... The 5300 is several generations newer. It's also a nice testament to Google's chosen 7-year support.

Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services.

This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone. "},"72":{"post_title":"My Pixel 5 quit on me.

I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive. They suggested waiting until Monday so it would be cheaper - around \u20ac500, especially if it\u2019s on the route of the maintenance guy. So here\u2019s my dilemma \u2013 should I take the risk and pay to retrieve it, hoping it\u2019s still alive and functional, or leave it there and cut my losses? It\u2019s a brand-new, expensive phone, but \u20ac500 is a lot of money if it\u2019s completely broken\u2026What would you all do? Anyone else ever been through this? Could my protective gear have saved my Pixel 9 Pro?[lift shaft ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TZTSg3a.png)Update #1:Spend 1 hour with my magnet on a stick to poke around the shaft, but it's way deeper than my stick could reach. Tried to use my flashlight on every side to see if it's on the ground somewhere, but was unable to spot it. I think I was able to see only 5% of the whole area.I'll make some calls tomorrow to the building manager and the lift shaft maintenance company!Update#2I tried for 2 days to get contact with the company that does the maintenance. Called like 5-10 times. They would call back etc, but never did.Last time I called I said: \"I've read about a fire hazard risk, because the Li-on battery could be broken and explode in a few days, I've read about this online, could you add this to the ticket and let your supervisor know about this?\".Looks like that worked, because they will be at the building this week!Update #3Today was maintainance day and they found the phone. They will hand it over to me tomorrow. But they already made a picture and video and told us it was completely crushed, not working etc. I'll post the pics when I have it!

I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."},"92":{"post_title":"Well done Google.

While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"99":{"post_title":"120hz Scroll stutter is still pathetic on the Pixel 8","self_text":"# EDIT: The Android 15 update has improved scrolling a lot, apps like Messages, Playstore and Spotify are noticeably smoother.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"105":{"post_title":"Preorder deals for the Pixel 9 are up!

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"},"115":{"post_title":"A 128GB Pixel 9 Pro should never exist, Google","self_text":""},"116":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro - Can't receive nudes via rcs\/sms?","self_text":"Title says it allThe girl I'm seeing at the moment was a bit upset with me today, given I hadn't responded to her spontaneous spicy pictures she's sent my way    I (*after reassuring her that I was in fact very appreciative of the gesture*) was very confused and showed her no eye cady had been received    We ran some tests together after having a laugh, and found out that my Pixel 9 Pro won't receive any nude pictures via google messages, but other messaging services like whatsapp and facebook messenger seem fine?

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"125":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL to start at $1,099 as more leaks confirm specs and AI features","self_text":""},"126":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.

I did enjoy certain aspects of the phone and it's a wonderful device. However, after switching back to a Pixel 9 pro recently (a family member needed a phone and I game them my S24 Ultra), I can say that this phone out performs the 24 Ultra day to day and the camera quality isn't even close.

"},"146":{"post_title":"After 14 Years of iPhone, I Finally Switched to Android: My One-Month Review of the Pixel 9","self_text":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"147":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I\u2019ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I\u2019ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I\u2019ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you\u2019re in a country that has one!"},"148":{"post_title":"Google replaced the faulty brand-new Pixel 9 phone with a refurbished one. How is it a fair trade?","self_text":"I ordered a brand-new Pixel 9 as a gift for my dad, who only uses two apps in addition to the default apps on the phone: Facebook and Facebook Messenger. However, the phone couldn't open the apps and often got stuck in indefinite restarting loops. It also heated up dangerously. I reached out for a refund, but Google insisted I resolve the issues through their support, which turned out to be unsuccessful. By the time I followed up, it was past the 15-day refund window, and they only offered a replacement. They provided two options: the Advanced Replacement option, where I would pay for a new phone upfront and then return the faulty one for reimbursement, or the Normal Replacement option, where I wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything upfront\u2014I would just return the existing phone and they would send me a replacement. Unfortunately, I received a bare-bones refurbished phone without any accessories, as they said it depended on availability. I emailed them with my concerns below. Is this a fair trade, in your opinion? Why is Google conducting business like this? I am extremely disappointed.*\"Hi Julia, Thank you for the update. I appreciate your clarification. However, I wish I had been clearly informed about the key differences between the two replacement options when they were initially presented to me. Specifically, I would have liked to know that the Advanced Replacement option, which requires upfront payment and later reimbursement, guarantees a brand-new phone, while the standard replacement option may provide a refurbished device. Additionally, how does Google determine \"availability\"? Does Google prioritize distributing brand-new phones as replacements before considering refurbished ones, or is it the other way around? If you were in my position as a rational customer, would you want to pay the price for a brand-new phone in exchange for a refurbished one that is about 30% lower in price? Not to mention the inconvenience of receiving a faulty phone which I ordered as a gift, and having to go through the hassle of getting a replacement after long conversations with Google support. How is this a fair trade? I would like to escalate this issue further, or you can agree with me on one of the following options: 1) Refund me. 2) Refund the difference between a brand-new phone and a refurbished one. 3) Send me a brand-new phone as if I had opted for the Advanced Replacement Option.

As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I\u2019ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition \u2014 it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! \ud83d\udc4fAnyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences?

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"158":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro Best Buy Test: Holy crap this telephoto lens!!!11one","self_text":"Pixel 9 Pro XL at Best Buy: OMG the Telephoto is Amazing------------------**Disclaimer:** Quick Share on these devices was disabled so I had no way to get photos off. I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."},"159":{"post_title":"I just saw someone still using a Pixel 2 ","self_text":"I recognized it immediately by the rear fingerprint scanner and out-of-color power button.

Granted, it was in a coffee shop and dude was seated a little closer to the window but still... The 5300 is several generations newer. It's also a nice testament to Google's chosen 7-year support.

I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers.

Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones.

Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"},"202":{"post_title":"After 14 Years of iPhone, I Finally Switched to Android: My One-Month Review of the Pixel 9","self_text":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"203":{"post_title":"Switched to pixel 9 pro after 10 years of iPhone, help me keep my choice!

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"207":{"post_title":"What does it take to break a Pixel phone?","self_text":"I've been using extremely budget-friendly smartphones all my life, but just a week ago, I upgraded during \"Black Friday month\" and purchased a Pixel 8a. While it's not a flagship model, for me, this was quite a significant investment.Within just seven days, I've managed to drop the phone twice, first onto the hardwood floor and then onto bathroom tiles. The last incident involved it falling from a height of about 2.4 meters (nearly 8 feet). I \"never\" drop my phone like this, so I'm somewhat in a state of disbelief.Surprisingly, I can't find a single scratch on the device, and all functions like the buttons, fingerprint reader, and other features seem completely unaffected.Have I just been incredibly lucky, or is there some kind of magic in this phone's build? Is it more slippery than the typical Samsung Galaxy A series, or have I just become extraordinarily clumsy?\\-------EDIT: Quick note about Spigen case cost...Spigen gets a lot of recommendations here, and sounds like a great brand. I was just puzzled to see it (Spigen Rugged Armor) is less than half the cost of the original Google Pixel 8a case (obsidian) in my country.

My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I've previously taken. - Problems I've had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as \"gimmicky\", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I've been wanting to try more foods, so I'll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it'll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It'll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used \"Add me\" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there's finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I've had the buds 3 for about a week and they've been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you're on the fence on switching - I'd suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you're worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I've had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds. Full ecosystem! If you have any questions about the switch, let me know!

I actually liked the Pixel 4 better, maybe it was the form factor or Android 12, but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesn't. The OS now is fine but not great, though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher. But man, the apps on Android are still a mess. Everything\u2019s buggy, and Android ~~15~~ 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways. Notifications are a pain, the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy.

That thing is trash\u2014it\u2019s small, buggy, laggy, and the apps barely work. The photos from the P8P were fantastic, so no complaints there as expected. Pixel Buds Pro were really good, again no complaints there. But overall, I was just let down and really wanted it to be better.

Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering.

It's so useful. (note I am aware of the android app that does this but it's flaky and crap.)Playing music hands free using Siri - if I'm cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it.  Pixel Gemini won't as it says it needs to be unlocked first. Very irritating.  There is a work-around for this, which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock, but there shouldn't need to be.Add reminders hands-free using Siri - same as above.  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly.  Pixel again asks to be unlocked first.Add location-based reminders hands free using Siri - can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home.  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here.  Most of the time it just says it can't do that, but occasionally it says it has done it, but nothing happens.  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesn't announce itself but is there!  This is my biggest bugbear with Gemini.Customising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion - I love swiping for different colours, looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff.  And I LOVE the multicoloured time.Using collections of images as lock screen pictures - this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this.

(again yes I'm aware there is software for this but I haven't managed to find one that's free that works the same without ads or isn't flaky etc.)Interaction generally between calendar, reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel.  Every option I need is on there.  Location based reminders, repeating, adding locations with a link to Maps, everything.  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited. Baffling.\u2018Bouncing\u2019 animated photos - where you can get a top-shot image (eg short video) and select it to 'bounce' back and forth. This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app.  Not possible on Pixel.Copy and paste from phone to MacBook\/iPad and vice-versa.  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time.  Obviously Pixel is unable to do this.AirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music. Yes I'm a weirdo and use AM not Spotify.  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app. (Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM can't natively, so this is a bonus for Pixel)The Journal app - I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default (happy to hear people's recommendations here for one which works with iOS\/AndroidWiFi QR codes\/share WiFi password - this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform. As far as I know it isn't on Pixel.Safari reading mode - I hate adverts; I mean I really really HATE modern advertising.  So I use this feature all the time.  Pixel does not have it. But... actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google.  See my comments on my Pixel list.Removing annoying ads in Safari - another iOS18 feature. God I love this! Just delete all those shitty, irritating adverts and read in peace. Works in MacOS too.Measurements tool - I use this quite a lot in my job and it's great.  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes.  The measure tool works really well. Image crop to screen size - another small but neat feature.  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen, a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized image.Swipe down to search is much, much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel. I use this feature a lot and it's great.  In fact I use this to do almost everything.  You can search for videos, photos (by person or by subject eg 'dog', 'beach', 'York Minster' etc), music, emails, images, apps, news stories, anything.  It's brilliant.  The Pixel one is just really really limited.Keyboard- space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard, the Google one only moves left and right. This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying.  Apples solution is just better here.Note on keyboards: I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was, but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main. There is no noticeable difference for me between them.Night view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock.  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up.  Really nice feature.Calendar entries: If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries. Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries.  Siri is pretty shitty generally, but this is one area it really nails.Apple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far. I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and re-swiping every time.  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused.  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone.  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single time.Apple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together, setting reminders to work out and so on.  Just really well thought out.Screen attention (and by extension, face unlock) is much better on the iPhone; Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimes.*Now for my Pixel observations:**(Note these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14)*\u2018Now playing\u2019 on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me. Just love love love this feature.\u2018Now Playing\u2019 list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen.  So I don't even need to pay attention now, I can take a look later at what the song was.  Such a cool feature.\u2018Watch later\u2019 for YouTube suggestions, previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications.  This is brilliant and so much easier than Apples.Notifications are a bit better generally, but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification, or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three, BBC etc.Replying directly to messages from the notifications is great too.  Apple just doesn't do this.Cast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify. I don't use it but my daughter does and it's really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers. iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers, not all of them.Gemini generally better than Siri by a mile (except having to unlock phone nonsense, and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc.). It's such a shame it isn't all integrated properly, because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff.  Night and day better for asking about events, places, facts, news stories, pretty much anything. Siri's \"I've found this on the web\" is embarrassing and it's not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improves.Pixel screenshots is really handy too, just started using this and find it useful.  It's great you can create reminders from it as well, but why does it not back it all up?!  Annoying.Night Sight camera is amazing.  Four minute long exposure images, very cool.Not sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories, editing, and so on.  They are pretty closely matched for me. Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but it's very close.  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offer.Gemini live isn't there yet.  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying, I don't need my *phone* to remind me that all people are equal, or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google.  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links, show photos, play music and so on. And do it when the phone is still locked Google!Call screening - I haven't used it yet but presuming it works it's a great feature.The reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone.  Google has a free download called \"Reader mode\" and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen - this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too. It doesn't include images though, which the Apple Safari one does. This doesn't come preinstalled though.Recorder app with summary and text translation is a great feature.Split screen, although it is a bit flaky on Android 14 - Reddit always crashes using it for example.  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15? (or remove it...)Hold for me! Amazing if it works, again I haven't used it yet though.Direct my call, as aboveNotification history is a nice touch - being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one. Nice.Gemini feature 'ask about this screen' - option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it. Works quite well.Selecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news - you can block any providers you don't like completely; Apple news leaves a big sign there saying 'you have blocked this news provider - click here to unblock' which is a big 'screw you' from Apple as far as I can see.Google lens (although this is coming in iOS) is quite cool too.Magic eraser is really good for removing things from photos; works far better than I thought possible. (Again, it is coming to iOS in the coming months.  I used the beta though and it was poor)Now a couple of observations about smart watches:Apple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking, working out and listening to music.Sleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3, my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleep.Exercise stuff seems pretty similar, although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects, corrupting my data.  Very annoying.  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fine.It is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch. On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you aren't using the standard faces.Ultra is far tougher than the pixel Watch, I'm still nervous about scratching my PW3.I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2's so no comparison there yet.Well I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful. \ud83d\ude42 I'm sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features. If so, thanks.

The Apple presentation feels fake, CGI and AI generated.* Besides that, Apple showed a lot more hardware and software novelties than Google. The hardware makes a lot better impression. The Pixel 9 Pro should have no chance against the iPhone 16 Pro when it comes to processing power and things like 4K 120 FPS recording. The audio mixing with the new microphones could be awesome. I like the new camera button. That's as cool as the capacitive fingerprint sensor that allowed us to drag down the notification bar until Pixel 5.* Google focused entirely on Gemini, while Apple showed many other interesting software features. I really like the new photo, video and audio recording and editing features they showed. They added some things our Pixel phones already have for many years. * I don't know if this is because Google wants to focus on Gemini or because Google doesn't have the new Android version yet but I'm a bit worried that the new Android version won't come with that many new software features. At the same time Gemini isn't as good as GPT here so the Apple Intelligence combined with the free access to GPT seems much better.* The Pixel 9 (128 GB) costs 899\u20ac in Germany, the iPhone 16 (128 GB) costs 949\u20ac here.* The Pixel 9 Pro (128 GB) costs 1099\u20ac, the iPhone 16 Pro (128 GB) costs 1199\u20ac here.* I would say the iPhone 16 has a much better price performance ratio than the Pixel 9.

This post isn't exhaustive but might help those considering switching to the Pixel 8 Pro.First, the iPhone is undeniably a great device, and there are reasons why people love it. My issue isn't with the device itself but with Apple as a company and the culture they've created. I dislike Apple's arrogance and greed, which is why I've decided to avoid their products from now on. The iPhone is well-rounded but quite boring.I then switched back to Android, opting for the S24 Ultra. While the hardware is excellent, the software is disappointing. The camera performance is subpar (especially for moving objects) , and surprisingly, the battery life didn't meet my expectations. I couldn't tolerate the inconsistency across the device and the constant clash between Samsung and Google ecosystems.Finally, I returned to my first love - Pixel. I owned every Nexus device years ago, and Google phones always had something special about them. Although the magic isn't as strong as it once was, the Pixel is arguably the best all-around Android device. Despite not having the latest and greatest hardware and some occasional bugs, it works well overall, takes great pictures, and maintains consistency across the device.If you have similar priorities to mine, don't waste time and money buying and selling different phones. Go for the Pixel and stick with it. You won't find anything better. The hardware is sufficient, even with the Exynos-based Tensor chip. The only area that really needs improvement is connectivity.

Definitely switching back or buying a Samsung.","self_text":"I constantly see all these ex iphone users switching to Pixel and there's only praise. Well here's a different kind of post to potentially save someone from making a mistake if the below issues are big enough\u2022 Being able to share my screen from iphone to a smart tv is such an easy to do process. I just use AirPlay (Cast) and it mirrors my screen to any smart tv that's on the same wifi network. With Pixel that's not possible. You either have to have a Chromecast device or use a third party app that's full of ads. As someone who likes to watch movies for free by casting them from my phone to the TV, this a deal breaker.\u2022 No native gallery app. The photos\/videos are saved in Google Photos app which is inconvenient. For example if I take screenshots\/screen recordings, in order to find them in the app I have to navigate through several menus (Collections -> On This Device -> Screenshots\/Movies) in order to view them which is more complicated than just having them available in the main gallery with everything else. \u2022 When typing and if you long press on the spacebar, on the iphone you get to move the cursor through the entire text. On the Pixel you can only move the cursor horizontally. Since the phones are big, I don't want to have to reach across the screen in order to select a specific part of the text that I want to edit.\u2022 Setting a timer is more complicated than it needs to be. You have 6 slots (HourHour:MinuteMinute:SecondSecond) and let's say you want a timer for 1 hour and 20 minutes. You have to input the timer number values manually via a number pad and the number values go in order from right to left. So setting up a 1 hour 20 minute timer means you press 1 then 5 then 8 then 0 then 0 so that way the timer is 01:58:00. So if you're new to Pixel, very tired or in a rush, having to set up a timer can feel like a chore.\u2022 Selling my Pixel will be a bad experience because it doesn't hold as much value as an iPhone over time and because nobody wants a used Pixel\/Android.This is less than a month of me owning the device so I'm sure I'd find even more things to complain about as time goes on. The biggest deal breaker is definitely the Cast situation. I ain't buying a pricey gadget just so I can mirror my screen. People like to say Pixel\/Android is freedom and more customizable than the restrictive iphone but so far I'm feeling way more restricted compared to iphone.

Especially the \"a\" series?","self_text":"(I'll mainly talk about the Indian market cuz I don't have any idea how it's pricing is in other countries)Pixel Phones are really good and minimal with that classic stock  Android. But the pricing of pixel Phones are really weird. Like, why does the normal variant of every Pixel Phones when launched costs over 80k rs? (I think for whatever it's offering, 50-60k should be good enough for that).The Fold and the Pro version are understandable, as they'll price higher. But the Pro version also should not be priced above 1 Lakh I believe?And even after that, if we talk about the a series, It's meant to be a mid ranger right? Then why the hell it's pricing reaches above 30k?Like they get priced mostly above 40-50k when launched.Whatever the pixel a series phones offer, they shouldn't be priced above 30-35k at all normally. Even with the that many years of OS updates policy.Cuz other than the great camera and stock android and update support, everything else is pretty much normal and it makes it more overpriced. The base series and a series are nonsensely priced I believe. Okay. Some one said I should make my point more clear. Right. As per Nothing and Samsung (won't talk about Motorola but it can also be considered here), they all are non Chinese phones and all of them kinda gives that premium vibe. But look at Samsung. They have Ultra models pricing more than a Lakh rs, and they have very cheap budget models aswell. They have proper midrange phones which also provides around 4-5 years of OS Upgrades, good performance and also a great camera all that with good after sales service and? They are perfectly priced very often (if you're not talking about the S Fe series).Then look at Nothing. They are also doing the same. Although less os upgrades comparatively, they are also giving near stock android experience with their own touch. And they are performing really good. They have an upper midrange series (which is kinda overpriced too).But? Their budget series (which is also a series) are perfectly priced around 23k to 28k rs at launch including the upgraded + models. And? They also have a budget series which is also a very great choice called CMF PHONE 1. And it's performing well in the budget segment too! Although less features, still a great experience!Same with Motorola aswell.Even though Pixel phones are kinda overpriced as per what they offer (and yes! They do get down in price after a bit time later of release), their a series is also meant to feature less features and it does! And it should be priced not more than 30k-35k even at launch imo.Idk how it is sold in other countries tho. This is a reason why in comparison to these premium brands, Google Pixel still sucks in terms of pricing, especially their Midrange a series.

The quality of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (in both sound and usability) is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the Airpod Pros 2. I'm no tech guru but as an average consumer (who listens to music while doing admin work in the office or while running outdoors), the sound quality on these things (Pixel Buds Pro 2) is magnificent. The bass quality had me dancing almost right away. And the noise cancellation works SO well.As far as usability is concerned, it always drove me nuts on the Airpod Pros 2 whenever I'd need to switch songs while I was out for a run. I hated having to squeeze both sides of an airpod multiple times just to change a song, go back, or pause. Perhaps it's just me or the shape of my ears but whenever I would squeeze the airpod, I'd have to quickly re-adjust the airpod in my ear. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 **are so simple to use** -a quick tap on the outside of the bud does the job! Accessing Google Assistant or enabling Noise Cancellation feels so easy to do.Also, I love that there are color variations to choose from on the Pixel buds! This may not be important for everyone but it is to me.It was worth every penny switching over to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 from the Airpod Pros 2!

Third Pixel to bite the dust","self_text":"I've always loved the clean UX and overall flexibility of these phones, but it just feels foolish to keep buying a premium phone that will only last a couple of years before becoming unusable.Started with a 2XL, which was a pleasure to use. Power button started having trouble about a year and a half in, and the charging port got wonky shortly thereafter. Fine, I can understand the early iterations having some things to work on, and I wouldn't be surprised if I bent the charger by accident somehow.Decided to try the 5a next, since I was strapped for cash at the time. It was adequate, though notably laggy at times. Made sure to put a heavy-duty case on it and keep the ports protected, since it wasn't rated as well for moisture, dust, etc. Despite being very easy on it, this one just straight-up bricked about two years after getting it. Completely unrecoverable. It was diagnosed as a motherboard issue.So I thought I'd learned my lesson and decided to go for the premium model again with a 7 Pro. Great performance, a killer camera, and my only minor gripes usually get fixed with updates. It overheats too easily, but whatever.  AGAIN, it's been less than two years and it's got some kind of internal hardware problem. Bricks itself randomly, won't turn on for hours at a time (even in safe mode, regardless of charge). The first time it did it, it was off for so long that I thought it was completely fried. Magically turned on by itself a few hours later. Would work for a few minutes or an hour or a day, then repeat the process. I didn't have any issues for a few months, and it just started doing it again over the past few days. It's completely unreliable, and I'm just waiting for the day it's going to strand me or make me miss something important for work. I'm currently praying it will turn back on in a few hours.Is this just bad luck? I always use cases that are well-rated for drop protection. I keep the software up-to-date. Heck, I've even done a factory reset roughly every year as preventative maintenance\/ housekeeping. I'm not visiting any sketchy websites or downloading anything wild.I can only think of two things I've done that might be or have been detrimental:  I fidget by tapping on my phone in my pocket sometimes. Not like beating the crap out of it or anything, just tapping. Nothing harder than if you were excitedly playing a game or doing the double-tap gesture to show notifications when it's locked. I suppose I could see this shaking something loose over a long period of time or something, but that feels like a flimsy excuse.  The other thing only applies to the 5a\u2013 I bought some NFC tags and played around with some NFC and automation apps. Everything was from the Play Store if I recall, but they required pretty liberal permissions to use how I wanted. I'm no hardcore developer or anything, but I generally knew what I was doing. I was using resources and instructions from trustworthy places. I did some neat stuff with my smart lighting and saved a lot of time automating work things. There never seemed to be any directly observable issues.   After my 5a bricked so suddenly, I thought I'd be cautious by staying away from anything too far out of the box, and never used those apps or things in that realm on the 7 Pro. I doubt it was a problem in the first place, but again, I'm no h4x0r and I might've been a bit out of my depth.I still owe $480 on this 7 Pro that is currently unresponsive, and I can't help but notice that iPhone users don't seem to have this kind of consistent trouble. It's not even like the price difference is that stark anymore.Fool me once, etc"},"248":{"post_title":"Bluetooth connectivity issues on Pixel 9 Pro XL","self_text":"I've been using the pixel buds pro without problems for the past 2 weeks and now it has terrible range all of a sudden for some reason.

Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and I'm not a pro reviewer or anything.Firstly, wow these are so small and light!  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big.  They are really comfy to wear too. Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2.117 for buds and 1.55 for case.The sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s.  I haven't played with the EQ and probably won't to be honest, because songs are recorded at so many different levels you'll be constantly fiddling with it, so I just leave it as is.  I'm also over fifty now so my hearing isn't top notch!The noise cancelling is excellent, and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far. All of it feels really nicely made, the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is like.Now for the problems.Now this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned, but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far.  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially, but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit.  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering, my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding.  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phone.Then when I put my hood up and starting jogging back, the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off.  Very annoying! Especially in the rain with a dog.Anyway, once this happened it was like the earphones crashed.  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again.  So I don't know if this is a software glitch or not, but I'm not going back out into the rain too test then again!Another thing is knowing where to tap them.  You can't see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance, you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track.  I'm going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment.  Airpods just work so much better in this regard.Anyway, these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours.  Perhaps after some use I'll get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them.  I hope so because they're lovely and sound and cancelling are great.EDIT: Forgot to mention, the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for it.EDIT2: multi-point connection works really really well for me.EDIT3: after saying all that about the multi point, it's stopped working!  Nothing will play on my Pixel now.  I had to put the buds back in the box, shut down all my media apps, shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work.  Poor!  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future. Sigh ..."},"254":{"post_title":"Do I return my pixel 9 pro xl?

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"256":{"post_title":"For those of you who have a Pixel phone but have a Galaxy Watch and\/or Galaxy Buds, how's the integration?

If you have anything currently in \"escalation,\" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen\/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their \"certified repair partner\" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a \"certified\" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a \"Manager,\" \"Supervisor,\" or member of the \"Escalation Team\" in 24-48 hours?

As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the \"extended warranties\" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly.

But there's a lot of stuff that the pixel needs to implement which I think would make it 100x better.1. Revamp the control center and make it similar to what iOS and oneui 7 are doing. Swipe left for notifications and swipe right for control center. I think the control center looks a bit ugly.  2. Better lockscreen customization. The pixel falls behind in lockscreen customizations compared to apple and samsung. First, they should add widgets to the lockscreen as well as specific places to put the clock etc. in the center and stuff like that3. Make minimum volume more quiet. I sleep with my brother and want to watch something but putting it on the lowest volume slider still makes it very loud in a quiet bedroom since it wakes him up. On my iPad, the volume is just right4. Ability to disable mobile data usage for certain apps (for the people with low data amounts). My brother plays this game called block blast which shoudn't use any data at all but its still consuming data and in large amounts too. Brands like apple, samsung, oneplus, xiaomi and more all have thios feature but for some reason the pixel just doesn't have it (I don't need disabling data in the background, I want it to be disabled in the foreground)5. Transparent navigation and status bars. Most apps like chrome make the gesture navigation bar surrounded by a huge grey box which is very annoying and not aesthetically pleasing. Same thing for status bar but I can't remember which apps display either a grey or black box around it. 6. Ability to make bigger status bar icons (without making text look bigger). I know how to increase the icon size but it makes everything else look a lot bigger which I don't want it to. Make a specific setting which changes how big the icons appear or make the icons bigger by default like iOS. 7. (optional feature) Make face unlock use the same sensors as the iphone and make it work in low light areas as well as wearing accessories like sunglasses or masks since its very bad in those senarios. It only works in the dark sometimes.  The thing that really ticks me off is the control center and lock screen customizations. The pixel would be the really good after these stuff.

Also, every single one of them always had some degree of case defect, as the lid didn't align to the rest of the case, making an awful sound when closing. Hey, at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 10-20 days, it wasn't too bad after all. Well, unfortunately issues didn't end there. Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues? Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one. And the only way to fix this was\u2026 to stop any audio coming from them, wait for a couple of seconds, and then play again. Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing? It was horrible, silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds. Anyways, issues persisted all the time I've owned them and recently new ones started appearing, such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does. Well, this of course only happens when I'm just listening to anything, because when I'm in a call they only last 15-20 minutes. And last but not least, some of these buds sometimes think they're charging when they're actually not, and sometimes they think the case is open while it's actually not.Before anyone says anything, yes I've contacted multiple times Google support, even with Google One, and they always had the same troubleshooting process: charge them and factory reset them. Needless to say this didn't work ever.Anyways, yes this looks like a rant and it probably is. These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google, they have absolutely awful support and they're terrible on every aspect. I've also never owned any other wireless earbuds before, so I can't even say they're terrible compared to X. No, they're terrible, period. All this, for an even more awful price tag of 200 \u20ac. That's disgusting. And no, I'm not trying to boycott Google. I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch, and they're great. Great price (not so much for the watch, but if we compare it to Apple's\u2026) and great functionalities.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

It looks like my Pixel is attached to a spacecraft when I do recordings where I move a bit.Also, just in the preview with 50 MP the screen lags all the time.

Seriously?"},"309":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.","self_text":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"310":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL to start at $1,099 as more leaks confirm specs and AI features","self_text":""},"311":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.

No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger.

I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14.

As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic.

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"322":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro Best Buy Test: Holy crap this telephoto lens!!!11one","self_text":"Pixel 9 Pro XL at Best Buy: OMG the Telephoto is Amazing------------------**Disclaimer:** Quick Share on these devices was disabled so I had no way to get photos off. I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs.

","self_text":"If you are like me, one of the main things stopping you from going all in on the Pixel line is really poor performance from the modem. If a phone can't make calls, and access the Internet, none of the other features matter IMHO. So far things are very promising with the 9 pro. My office is a bit of a torture chamber for cell phones. I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers. If they ask for the wifi code I tend to take note of what device they are using. Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones. My company provided ATT iPhone is 1 bar of cellular, but no data. My pixel 6 & 7 pros were both completely no service, and would also burn up tons of battery just desperately trying to connect. Today is the first day I am sitting at my desk with the Pixel 9 pro XL, and it is doing fantastic. I decided not to enter in the wifi code right away, and see how it handled being at the very fringe of cell coverage. Not only can I both call, and browse the Internet at decent speeds, the battery is not taking a hit at all. It has been very miserly sipping standby battery, and hardly going down at all while idling, with no detectable heating up.I need to perform some more tests before saying for sure that it is on par with the QC modem in my Samsung, but this is definitely a big upgrade. I also noticed it came close to maxing out my 500mbps wifi at home last night. The 7 was better in that regard, but the 6 pro even had spotty wifi performance at times.

They wouldn't let me pop in a SIM card to test the modem, but I can give you some more details about the rest.The phone's a bit heavier than I expected, but it feels really comfy in hand. I've got mixed feelings about the sides - they're pretty prone to fingerprints, but overall it feels way more premium than any other Pixel before. The screen is incredibly bright, I'd say even a bit brighter than my S24 Ultra. It's slightly narrower and taller than the S24 Ultra, but we're talking tiny differences here.I snapped some quick photos, which was a bit tricky since the guy was scared of getting fired for letting me handle it. The pics look really nice - much brighter than what I took in the same conditions with my S24 Ultra. It's possible that the screen is just super bright, but I'm pretty sure it's not just that - the pictures looked really bright and contrasty, maybe the best I've seen from a phone so far.What I didn't like was that it still stutters here and there, especially noticeable in the Photos app. I haven't seen the same thing with the S24 Ultra, but who knows, maybe it'll get optimized with Android 15.Overall, I think a lot of people will dig it because of the premium feel. Maybe not so much for power users though, as it's not quite as snappy as the S24 Ultra is (and the S25 Ultra will probably be even faster).I guess this isn't news to you, but I thought I'd mention it anyway."},"345":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing!","self_text":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices. To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone. "},"346":{"post_title":"My Pixel 5 quit on me.

I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close.

It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"361":{"post_title":"120hz Scroll stutter is still pathetic on the Pixel 8","self_text":"# EDIT: The Android 15 update has improved scrolling a lot, apps like Messages, Playstore and Spotify are noticeably smoother.

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

The 5x optical zoom does the difference too.UI and UX: The pixel experience is perfect, no bloatware, attention to the detail, perfect UI, simple, easy to root or unlock bootloader if you're that kind of person, It all couldn't be better. Kudos to Google for that.Hardware and performance:CPU is great, GPU is not the best but can run any game at **max settings** **at at least 50fps**, this includes genshin impact and fortnite at max settings btw. The TPU allows for lightning quick ai photo perfection, recording summarization, audio s\u00e9paration in video, message remixing and more. Also 12gb ram which is perfect. Build quality: Couldn't be better the phone itself is smooth to the touch, beautiful, doesn't break easily if you don't throw it on the floor, stable on a flat surface despite the camera and moreScreen: Georgous, adaptative refresh rate means always on display consumes about 0.7% battery per day if always on. Adaptative refresh rate also triggers when content on the screen doesn't move aka when you read which makes the device last multiple days. It's also OLED of super AMOLED I forgot so the colors are perfect and accurate and beautiful.Overheating: Doesn't, heats just a little bit while heavy gaming but not that bad (not **over**heating)Fingerprint sensor: It's optical so if your screen is dirty or your finger is wet it won't work well and even sometimes when everything is right it won't work, it will tho if you set your main finger two times work perfectly every time except if wet or way too dirty.Face unlock: Everything perfect except it doesn't work in the dark if youre too far from your screen because not enough light. It also detects if your eyes are closed or if you're not looking at it in which case it wont unlock.Battery life: On TikTok lasts an average of nine hours because dynamic refresh rate can't kick in, on heavy gaming 5 for the same reason and also heavy processing, for light gaming 8 because the dynamic refresh rate cant kick in either and processing, while for reading it lasts multiple days. If you use this phone normally it will last one day or two before requiring to charge, it also has adaptative charging so if you charge at night and you setup bedtime mode it'll turn on bedtime mode disabling notification for the night and charging your phone to about 80% and then it'll charge slowly hitting 100% when your alarm rings, slow charging preserves battery. The part of this phone that consumes way too much battery is the modem which is not energy efficient (what connects to the cell tower) meaning that heavy networking will consume more battery.Software updates: 7 years of android updates and feature drops garrented. (More than iphone)Price: 900 bucks, not expensive for a device this quality.Do I recommend: If you're ready to put in the price to get a perfect phone that lasts 7 years, then yeah buy it I promise you you will never regret it. Else buy the 8 or 8a but expect worse battery life, camera and slightly worse build quality and 8gb ram instead of 12, but you'll get he same chip so same general performance except the phone will heat slightly more while gaming because of reduced size"},"379":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL","self_text":"Guysssss....

"},"380":{"post_title":"Just Upgraded from the Pixel 6 to Pixel 9 Pro XL, What a Difference!","self_text":"I've been a Pixel fan ever since the original Pixel XL. I was a Motorola Droid user before the Pixel series came out, and I fell in love with the simplicity of the original Pixel XL, the slick look, the fingerprint scanner, and the capability of the phone overall. I bought my Pixel XL in July of 2017, and kept it until the battery gave up in February of 2022, when I then got the Pixel 6. I was never really overly-happy with the 6, other than the size. I felt like the battery would drain really fast with minimal use, the camera was extremely disappointing, the phone itself felt really cheap, the camera shutter made a rattling noise every time my phone would move, I could go on. Because it worked however, I kept it. The battery finally died not too long ago, and I just went to T-Mobile to trade it in for a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Good lord, right off the bat, this phone FEELS far more premium, and more worth the price tag than the 6 ever did. I like the iPhone aesthetic the phone has going on with the rounded edges. I also love the nice, large screen. I know it's not significantly bigger than the 6, but it's still noticeable to me. I especially love the new camera spot, and the way that it's raised and protected by the aluminum body, as opposed to the all-glass camera on the 6. It also has a nice weight to it, not too crazy, but enough to know you have a high-end piece of tech in your hands.As for the software, the 9 operates like I think the 6 should have. It's very reminiscent of what it felt like to switch to the original Pixel XL from my cheap Droids. The animations are smooth, and I don't even have the smooth animation option on. The themes, stock wallpapers, even ringtones are excellent. The camera is also a HUGE improvement over the 6. I would take pictures of documents to scan them with my 6, and the picture would always come out looking like my lenses were smudged, and my astral photography always left something to be desired. The camera on the 9 Pro has been phenomenal. Close-up pictures are much more clear, and the options for getting the perfect shot are plentiful. I have not tried the astral photography settings on the 9 Pro yet, but I will be doing so as soon as there's a clear night and no moon. I will say, I don't believe that the 9 Pro camera is on par with the Samsung cameras, which are some of the best on the market, but it at least rivals, if not surpasses the camera on the iPhone.Overall, Google has dramatically improved the Pixel series from the 6. The 9 Pro has better battery life, smoother operation, an overall nicer look and more premium feel, and the camera actually lives up to the hype. As long as the battery has better longevity than the battery in the 6, I'm hoping to have this phone for at least as long as I had the original Pixel XL for. I feel like Google has outdone themselves with this phone!"},"381":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro line: A Leap Forward or Just Another Incremental Update?

Based on the information we have from leaks so far:1. A new display featuring the latest technology, expected to be brighter and more energy-efficient.2. A new SoC based on the Exynos 2400 with an improved fabrication process. It may not be significantly faster, but it should be much more power-efficient.3. A new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, similar to the one in the S24 Ultra (possibly slightly improved).4. A new modem based on the Exynos 5400, likely offering better sustained high speeds and improved coverage. We're hoping it's also more energy-efficient.5. A new cooling system and internal component structure for better heat dissipation. The benefits are still uncertain, but we're optimistic.6. An upgraded camera array system with a significantly improved selfie camera and enhanced wide and ultra-wide sensors (though the main sensor remains unchanged).7. A new housing design (whether it looks better is subjective).Is this an incremental update? Absolutely not. It sounds like a completely new device.

I was previously an iPhone user (from the iPhone 8 Plus to the 14 Pro Max), but before my first iPhone, I had a Galaxy Note 5, so I know how using an Android phone is. I returned to Android with the Pixel 9 Pro because of its advertised AI features, and because I wanted more customization options.  It's been a bit jarring to realize that Android still isn't as smooth and polished as iOS.While Android offers many software features I love, such as Gemini, instant Google search, and text selection from the home bar\u2014things I wish Apple would integrate\u2014the app optimization is baffling!  Apps often look better and function more smoothly on iOS. For example, WhatsApp's UI is far superior on Apple, and the scrolling through apps and web pages are smooth like butter on iOS compared to Android.Another frustration is third-party launchers. I expected them to work seamlessly, but the phone glitches every time I try to return to the home screen. The default Pixel Launcher works perfectly, but I really want to customize my home screen without these annoyances!And to add to the list of my frustrations, I find Google photos to be lacking a lot in terms of navigation through media compared to iOS.I know, I could just ditch this phone and go back to an iPhone, but I won't.

Haven't changed phones since 10 XS Max, as I've been waiting for that damn \"island\" to disappear. 16 was the straw. Also, not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking (apple intelligence?!) and their hypocritical sales policy. You're not a force for good, you're just like most companies, in it for the money, stop pretending. Always been in the garden, but never, ever a fan boy. Being a fan boy\/girl for technology is ridiculous. Be a fan of peace, politeness, and respect and good things, like good food, good weather, good times and  good tech, regardless of the brand.  Love the box. Minimal and eminently recyclable. I know it costs them peanuts, but still it's a gorgeous, minimalist, eco design. Better than the shoeboxes from before. All you need. I look at and use my phone, not the box\/casing. If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays, you're in for a hard life.Lighter than my 10 XS Max. Most phones probably are nowadays.

Simplicity. Plus have insurance, so not worried about crippling drops. Set up\/moving across was a breeze. Used a cable. Took about an hour.Don't mind redoing all my passwords, like keychain or 1 Password. Gotta delete a lot. So an excuse to spring clean. Disappointed with subscription 1Password, bought a premium account, twice, a while ago. Bitwarden seems to be working fine. Also, no heating issues at all. Phone temperature stayed ambient, like the room. Even everyday usage doesn't heat it at all. But then I don't game or watch films\/series on it, that's what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for. I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though (on the weekends). Bonus, Sony uses Android TV, so I can control and talk to my TV. What a world we live in. Scary. And good. Keyboard is noiiiice. Love the haptic feedback without clicks. As I have stubby thumbs\/fingers (like pig's tits), typing seems to be pleasurable again.

I was getting some crazy, nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone. Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard, permanently. And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks. The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere, not just one line at a time. Still, not a massive deal. Or even a small one. I'm sure an app may solve it. Like jailbreaking. I'll live and learn. Usage is easy to get used to. Swipe gestures are like ios. The universal back is a god send. Love the simplicity and logic behind usage. Although, such in depth settings too. And deep search within settings. Gobsmacked. Battery life has been stellar. All day (0700 - midnight) use with 30% left at night. 9 hours screen time. And I'm constantly playing with it and editing photos. Which brings me to the camera. One of the main reasons for getting this phone. It's amazing. Does all I want and the quality is crazy good . The built in ai is mind boggling and fun. So easy to use, especially with the pixel tips app. Macro and astrophotography in one bundle, count me in. The zoom is excellent, especially for a phone. Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast, especially when adding 2 of the same person. Magic Eraser is also useful, better\/more convenient than using another app. Also, changing backgrounds is astoundingly good. Portait is also not too bad, when you adjust the blur manually. The pan and long exposure is fantastic, especially on a phone. Haven't tried much else, such as video. No bluetooth problems. No connection issues at all. One of the best things? The monochrome\/night mode. Absolutely love it. Like I get a new phone each night. And the always on lock screen. What have I been doing in life to miss out on these things?Gemini is fun too. Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily, includung Hue lights, TV, disappointing but true prognosis for my team's prospects, and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music (for the lossless, still use wired speakers, earbuds). Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all. Only things missing, the spacebar (see above), the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up (know I can get it with Touch the Notch). Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings. Absolutely no regrets at all. Love it. Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working, even though I live in France. Well done APK mirror and side loading, not achievable on iphone unless jail broken (which I used to do a bit of, to get Android features). Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone? Who knows. They just work. Overall, a highly recommend phone, coming from a 5 year old iphone. But highly recommend just the same. Magnificent piece of technology, hardware, os and cloud. Maybe I'll be back in a month complaining, but I highly doubt it. I hope. If anyone wants more in-depth details or has questions, ask away.

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like?

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"408":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro cutting off last ~1 second of video recording","self_text":"I can't seem to find anyone else mentioning this specifically but when recording a video on the 9 Pro, when I hit pause, it seems to cut the video a full second if not more from when I remember hitting the button.For example, if I am panning I will pause the video at a certain reference point, but upon reviewing the footage, it ends roughly a second earlier than I expect.

","self_text":"If you are like me, one of the main things stopping you from going all in on the Pixel line is really poor performance from the modem. If a phone can't make calls, and access the Internet, none of the other features matter IMHO. So far things are very promising with the 9 pro. My office is a bit of a torture chamber for cell phones. I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers. If they ask for the wifi code I tend to take note of what device they are using. Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones. My company provided ATT iPhone is 1 bar of cellular, but no data. My pixel 6 & 7 pros were both completely no service, and would also burn up tons of battery just desperately trying to connect. Today is the first day I am sitting at my desk with the Pixel 9 pro XL, and it is doing fantastic. I decided not to enter in the wifi code right away, and see how it handled being at the very fringe of cell coverage. Not only can I both call, and browse the Internet at decent speeds, the battery is not taking a hit at all. It has been very miserly sipping standby battery, and hardly going down at all while idling, with no detectable heating up.I need to perform some more tests before saying for sure that it is on par with the QC modem in my Samsung, but this is definitely a big upgrade. I also noticed it came close to maxing out my 500mbps wifi at home last night. The 7 was better in that regard, but the 6 pro even had spotty wifi performance at times.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."},"418":{"post_title":"I've had my Pixel 7 for about a year now and I miss my Pixel 2 (rant)","self_text":"My pixel 2 died last year and I had to scramble to get a new phone by the end of the weekend.Sure, the 7 is nice, I like the battery saving features, it's fast, and the camera and screen are great but this phone sucks in comparison...I miss the squeeze feature to get my assistant, I miss the fingerprint scanner in the back-This new scanner is hot trash and doesn't detect my fingerprint nearly as accurately. My pixel 2 was accurate almost every time as long as my finger wasn't wet or dirty AND you could access your drop down menu easily by scrolling your finger on the scanner; I need 2 hands to do that now.I miss my old assistant and voice to text. It may be because of an Android update but the new assistant isn't as good, the voice to text is ALWAYS WRONG I CAN'T TRUST IT EVER.My old phone was super accurate with voice to text; it rarely betrayed me like this phone does... and last November it didn't even sing me happy birthday in the morning like my old phone did.Today my assistant kicked on for no reason at work.

The option isn't even there, they just took it away.These are little things but they add up. My biggest gripe though is a two part,1. The phone is HEAVY, with a decent case it's like twice the weight of my Pixel 2. Kickstands on this phone are super handy to take weight off of your fingers and prop up the phone but2. The cases are garbage. Sure the case itself is fine, but they don't make cases with a good kickstands. I've been through 2 in less than a year with delicate use and they break like the cheap pieces of garbage that they are. This past weekend I pulled my phone out of my pocket and the kickstand came off completely.Google is apparently doing what Apple does and making so you have to buy their brand for accessories too....I wanted to get a dongle to watch youtube videos on my TV with my phone because I use an adblock browser (fight me) and I don't want the ads that come with Chromecast, but these newer phones are incompatible with dongles that let you do that.This will probably be my last pixel phone, I'm very disappointed with Google's business decisions and going along with the planned obsolescence like everyone else. Every generation seems like they take away good features and add unnecessary ones. I like smart lens, I like adaptive charging, but they didn't need to get rid of everything else to add those.I got 5 good years out of my Pixel 2 before it had any issues only to be reminded that newer isn't always better.  \\*Edit\\*I fully expected to get blasted into downvote hell and told that I'm wrong.

So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.

Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one.

Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"420":{"post_title":"Every Pixel Pricing","self_text":"| Model       | Storage (GB) | US Pricing (USD) | Canada Pricing (CAD) | UK Pricing

Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."},"422":{"post_title":"Long Post Ahead \u2013 My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User","self_text":"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."},"424":{"post_title":"Coming from an 8 Pro to the smaller 9 Pro","self_text":"It has been 24 hours and I have no regret with my upgrade. Yes, this is definitely an upgrade. You will have heard a lot of people talking about the build quality but until you actually experience it you have no idea what they mean. This thing is on another level. It really does make you think Google was playing all this time. Trust me, I have had every single pixel XL since Nexus died and it has never been on this level. I am using voice dictation for this post and it is 99% accurate. I have no idea what was going wrong on my 8 Pro but it was about 85 to 90% accurate. I spent so much time editing what I had dictated to my phone. Punctuation was non-existent too...and I have the same settings so it does make me wonder what else has gone on under the hood here. Anything that uses assistant is responding much quicker with a slickness that you knew the 8Pro was capable of but just never seemed to do consistently. Lastly, for me this size is perfect. I was tired of wielding around massive phones for the last 10 years or so. (I also had the Nexus 6 the Motorola one so I have been doing large phones for ages). This is refreshing. And yet another + \ud83d\ude04, Hazel colour was a foray into the unknown for me. I normally get the porcelain in memory of my Pixel  2 Panda. I am so pleased with this colour.

There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions. Happy to answer them."},"429":{"post_title":"Heads up: 10% off Google Store email","self_text":"It looks like Google is sending out 10% off coupons to certain Pixel 9 owners for use on some accessories.

Being able to just say \"stop\" is **so convenient**.I have a Google Pixel 9 Pro. I just checked - I don't have any app, security, or system updates.

Thanks to the comments (especially u\/FlowEasyDelivers and u\/EddieRyanDC), I was able to figure out what happened and it's fixed now!CharGPT was down the other day, so I tried Gemini on my phone, and in order to use it, Google forced me to switch to it over from Google Assistant as my phone's main voice assistant.So far I haven't seen any other side-effects from it, but it seems that one side-effect is it somehow toggled off the setting that allows using the \"stop\" verbal command - I think because it's under \"Google Assistant\" settings. **If you open up the system settings (not the Clock app settings) and search for \"Quick Phrases\", there's a toggle for \"Alarms and Timers.\" Re-enabling this toggle worked for me.**Initially I could not find this support article by googling my question, but in that settings screen they link to the following which is helpful.

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty\/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up. (Now if only we could adopt longer battery life to smart watches ::cough:: pixel watch ::cough::)Edit 4 - ended my day of normal-high usage at 25%. Woke up with it at 6:45 AM and laying down in bed with it now at 11:30 PM. ## Performance I don't really game much on my phone but it played Pokemon Go very easily.## Gemini vs Google Assistant? It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. \ud83d\ude02The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro. New phone has me with new lingo already Edit 5 - reworded the Gemini and Google Assistant section to make more sense.

I\u2019m hoping to see if anyone has any advice about whether it\u2019s the device itself or if it\u2019s a software issue. To preface - all apps are up to date and I have the latest software installed. The problems: * Instagram keeps putting a weird red tint on any pictures taken within the app. Whether it\u2019s stories or a DM pic, any picture gets processed with a red flush on my skin. I\u2019ve confirmed my normal camera doesn\u2019t do this, and I\u2019ve turned off the Ultra HDR setting as many people seem to recommend. It gets briefly fixed when I uninstall and then reinstall the app, but it doesn\u2019t last long before the red tint returns. * Snapchat takes super laggy and buggy videos. My friends with Pixels don\u2019t notice anything, but my friends with iPhones find the videos nearly unwatchable. The app itself also seems a bit slow when moving between chats and different areas of the app. * Scrolling and normal gestures sometimes glitch and lag. When swiping up to view previously open apps, I\u2018ve had the phone refuse to open\/show the tabs. When I shut the phone off and reopen then it usually performs as normal. Going left and right between views has proven occasionally slow or unresponsive. * Thumbprint recognition and face recognition appears to be spotty and sometimes not work. * Battery is draining unusually fast. I\u2019ve been told this should fix itself within 7-10 days as the phone optimizes itself, but I\u2019m unsure how true this is. * Phone is overheating. I\u2019m giving this one grace as it seemed to only overheat when I was doing a lot, like backing up photos or downloading music, but it doesn\u2019t feel promising. In short, I can never predict when the phone will glitch and lag and prevent me from a smooth experience, and when it will act as a normal phone. I\u2019ll include the relevant settings I have on below, but I\u2019m really not loving this experience.

XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my \"Google\" folder is [even bigger](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify\/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+\/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a \u00a31400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."},"442":{"post_title":"Recent Pixel 9 Pro Fold Bargain!","self_text":"Just wanted to share an awesome series of discounts etc. I got for my recent Pixel 9 Pro Fold purchase the other week on the Google Store.

No help from Google!","self_text":"I am posting here as a last resort as I have already tried to get support from Google through various channels - including their live chat, telephone support, Twitter support. They just reiterate the same copy-pasted responses without actually understanding the issue. I have also tried to DM PixelCommunity here on Reddit as well as opened a ticket on dmziggy's Reddit Request form and also DM'ed him directly, receiving no response from all of these channels.I have now turned to post here as I have seen others have had their issues resolved or rectified after posting here and following the subsequent exposure to their issues. Seems Google does not care unless there is an outcry.To summarise what happened, I ordered a the 9 Pro XL directly from Google Store with an estimated delivery date of 22nd August (I have ordered the 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, Buds, Tablet etc all before with no issues). When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it. Therefore, I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold, the phone was not in the actual phone box, and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the space.I immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them. They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there. When I contact DPD, they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and they'll have to rectify\/correct.Google Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and they've ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week.

I don't have conversations with it, as a rule.I got my Pixel 9 yesterday. Hardware-wise: lovely, solid little phone (literally: it's smaller, and I'm thrilled about that). Zippy, bright screen, lightning-fast fingerprint sensor, great camera. Overall I'm pleased, as an every-three-years updater.I turned on Gemini,  briefly, to see if it had improved.It... mostly hasn't.Of the things I listed above, the only thing it does reliably is turn lights on and off. Everything else? It flat-out refused to create a Calendar event (said it 'couldn't do that yet'), could not see items on my calendar that I could see with my own eyes in the app (like when my next dentist appointment was), and though it can add things to Keep, it does it by creating a brand-new list with the same name as the one I told it to add the item to (a brand-new list I then *cannot see* in Keep), unless the request is phrased very, very carefully. It took three tries.Maybe it's just because I'm in Canada? Canadians only get one voice in Gemini, at least according to the bot itself. I haven't yet been able to find confirmation of which features are and aren't available here, and it would be par for the bloody course that select, invisible features of this fancy new LLM simply aren't there for us (I've seen US users saying the Calendar stuff, at least, was working for them as far back as February). But boy, is this frustrating. Switching back to Assistant for now (again).ETA: Despite helpful advice (switching all the languages in the system and Google to US English), this still isn't working. I get \"Sorry, I can't help with that. You can create calendar events by using the Google Calendar App.\" And now I'm fed up with poking at it, so I'm sticking with Assistant for the time being, which already does all the stuff I want it to do. Thanks to everyone anyway!ETA2: I did eventually get Create Calendar Event working, by uninstalling\/disabling Gemini, turning off activity and extensions at the account level in browser, and starting from scratch with *only* the language in Gemini set to US English (changing device language to US English broke it again), then enabling the Workspace extension only when prompted. I documented my testing, I repeated the steps, and if I did any of that after the fact, or in a different order, it failed. Officially too much trouble as an end user, and at the moment, not worth it to me, as it still can't do better than half the other basic tasks I currently use Assistant for. (If you enjoy having conversations with your phone, and all the summarizing and email-writing stuff, more power to you. That's not what I need or want a voice assistant to do. I want it as an interface into my phone's operating system.)I also feel pretty strongly that a flagship product shouldn't require me to jump through so many hoops to get it to perform a basic, advertised function. E.g., if it's supposed to be available in my region, I shouldn't have to change languages to get it to work.(And it still can't tell me when my next dentist appointment is. \ud83d\ude02)Going back to Assistant.

It's a good thing I bought my fold when I did because now the pixel 7 Pro is worth nothing..I actually bought a Google pixel 7 Pro from eBay for \u00a3200 and traded it in for \u00a3700. So I made a \u00a3500 saving on the Pixel 9 Pro fold.That's why on eBay in the UK pixel 7 pros were selling between \u00a3150 to \u00a3200. But when people found out that this was happening where people were purchasing pixel 7 pros on eBay and trading them in for \u00a3700. The prices started going up but it was very hard to find a very good condition one because you wanted you to get the full \u00a3700 for a mint condition one.Which I did I bought 2 \u00a3150 for a hazel colour and \u00a3195 for a black fully boxed with cable and a mouse case!

I'm just going to mention issues I experienced personally that I wish I\u2019d known earlier. So please go easy on me.**P.S. If it\u2019s too long, just read the headlines in CAPITAL LETTERS.****DISPLAY**\u25cf THE SCREEN IS UNSATURATED, EVEN WITH 'ADAPTIVE COLORS' ACTIVEIn my opinion, it\u2019s not trying to be \u201caccurate,\u201d it\u2019s just extremely bland. I tested almost every flagship phone at stores, and the Pixel looks the most lifeless.\u25cf IT HAS 240 Hz PWM DIMMING, THE LOWEST IN THE MARKETiPhone and Samsung have 480 Hz. Chinese brands have 1000+ Hz. People say only PWM-sensitive users may get affected, but that\u2019s not true. Even if you don't actively experience discomfort, it is said to damage your eyes in the long run.Yesterday, after using my phone for a while, I went to the bathroom and noticed one of my eyes was red with a dark red nerve line. I even felt light strain, like zooming in and out. This has never happened to me on any phone.**CAMERA PHOTOS (after trying all settings)**\u25cf THE DEVICE CAPTURES UNSATURATED PHOTOSBoth front and back cameras. In the viewfinder, they somewhat look decent, but after the 3-5 second post-processing, the colors are completely washed away.I sent photos from this phone, iPhone, and Samsung to my MacBook Air. The Pixel was the most colorless. Not accurate at all. Couple this with the above-mentioned unsaturated screen, and you get a ghost town.This unsaturation is really bad. My dark blue bedsheet looks sky blue. Skin tones look extremely white\/grey (I\u2019m brown), while hair looks extremely dark. It's a mess. I compared it with my friend's iPhone and, BOY, I actually saw my real skin color on it.\u25cf 50 MP CAMERAS DON'T MATTER THAT MUCH. YOU'LL BE CAPTURING WITH 12 MP 90% OF THE TIME(1) The 50 MP camera takes way more time to capture (shutter lag) and process (2) You need to be VERY still with it. (3) It creates a blurry mess indoors if you don\u2019t follow (1) and (2). iPhone doesn\u2019t have this issue at higher megapixels.\u25cf HORRIBLE EDGE DETECTION IN PORTRAITThis phone doesn\u2019t have Lidar like the iPhone. It just goes yolo and creates hilariously bad portraits, even with AI. Plus, the bokeh looks artificial most of the time.**CAMERA VIDEOS**\u25cf WEIRD STABILIZATION (ALL 3 MODES)Not intelligent at all, especially indoors. It tries to lock in on a subject too hard. So when you move the camera, it\u2019s like trying to drag a kid. This creates constant jerks and stutters.Whenever I move my camera fast and stop, the frame abruptly jerks in different directions before stopping.\u25cf VIDEOS HAVE STUTTER\u25cf LENS TRANSITION IS BADMakes you not want to zoom.\u25cf FRONT CAM VIDEO IS HORRIBLE AT NIGHT (VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE)The video is completely covered in small vertical moving lines, making it look like a heavy rain filter. I don\u2019t get how reviewers didn\u2019t catch this.**SOUND**\u25cf NOT AS LOUD AS OTHER FLAGSHIPS IN MY OPINION\u25cf NO DOLBY ATMOSI loved this in my S23 Ultra because I could instantly set audio to 'Voice' while listening to ASMR.\u25cf NO BUILT-IN EQUALIZER AT ALLYou have to download third-party apps for this. I couldn\u2019t get any to work smoothly.**MINOR ISSUES**\u25cf YOU HAVE TO SWIPE DOWN TWICE TO CHANGE BRIGHTNESS MANUALLYLiterally, every other phone in the market lets you change it with one swipe.\u25cf THE BACK CAMERA GLASS ISN'T COATED WITH SAPPHIRE LIKE... EVERY OTHER PHONE IN THE MARKETThis means it\u2019s low-quality, weak, and prone to scratches, especially since it\u2019s a huge long glass. I\u2019ve already read many people saying they\u2019ve scratched theirs.**Done.**By the way, I just checked something. I pointed the camera at my bed and took a screenshot in the viewfinder, then took a photo. I compared the two, and BROTHER, it\u2019s night and day. Even after turning HDR and P3 Colors on and off. The viewfinder is much more accurate and color-rich.Fk the modern post-processing. Wtf!?"},"463":{"post_title":"First time Pixel user.

I also reviewed my friends' Pixel 9\/9 pros. The colors seem washed out, and the screen lacks natural real life saturation. When compared to an iPhone, a Galaxy device, pixel 7 or even a professional monitor, the display looks almost lifeless.I understand that Pixel displays are often described as more \"natural,\" but I'm also comparing it to real-life colors, like those in a park, and the difference is still glaring. The problem is so noticeable that photos taken on the Pixel look far better when viewed on a monitor. Additionally, white on the screen often have a yellowish tint, which further detracts from the overall experience. I\u2019ve already tried adjusting both the \u201cNatural\u201d and \u201cAdaptive\u201d color settings, but neither seems to resolve the issue.What\u2019s strange is that when I\u2019m outdoors, where auto-brightness kicks in, or when I manually set the brightness above 80%, the colors seem to improve. It\u2019s almost as if the device recalibrates itself under these conditions. However, at lower brightness levels, the color reproduction becomes muted and off, making the display feel less vibrant and accurate.I strongly believe Google should implement a simple, user-adjustable setting for color calibration, similar to what\u2019s available on iPhones or Galaxy devices. Alternatively, I would love to see the return of the \"Boosted\" mode that was previously available.As a partial workaround, I\u2019ve found that adjusting the color correction settings in Accessibility (by selecting the \"Blue-Yellow\" or \"Red-Green\" filters and setting the intensity to 0 on the left) it improves the color quality. Interestingly, when this is done, a \"Picture Color Mode: Use sRGB\" option appears in the developer options, removing the \"Adaptive\/natural Color\" in the settings. If you turn off the color correction, this mode disappears from the developer options.This adjustment is a bit clunky, but it shows that there is potential for improvement in color reproduction accuracy and vibrancy. It would be great if Google could introduce a more intuitive solution."},"467":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL Keeps Restoring Deleted Texts","self_text":"So I just upgraded from a Pixel 7 to a Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Take off the sticker on the Ringke Case covering the magnets and take out a section of magnets from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock.

Google assistant works perfectly.All banking apps I have work, as like my as \"Exploit protection comparability mode\" is enabled for each of them. I'm unsure what this is exactly - aside from just extra protections but into GrapheneOS - but disabling them on a per app basis seems necessary for my banking apps.Google services without network permissions. GrapheneOS adds the ability to deny any network access to individual apps. This was great for me because I love GBoard, but didn't love the idea of every keystroke being sent to google.

The vapor chamber definitely makes a big difference.

I was looking into Pixels but they've been out of my price range at the time.Fast forward a few years, I've gotten myself a job and I'm looking for a company phone, which I've \"settled\" with a Pixel 7 Pro, as the non-pro was out of stock and work would cover the price difference. Great. I got the phone and immediately changed my perspective on high-end Android phones, and Pixels as a whole. It's genuinely the best phone I've owned up until that point. My only complaints were the software bugs that took forever to fix, weak haptics (coming from an iPhone), large size and the curved display, which I've never been a fan of. Looking for a personal phone, I've set my eyes on the Pixel 9 series when the leaks about a smaller \"Pro\" model came out. When it actually came out, I was quite frankly disappointed. AI slop all over the marketing, no Qi2, a very ambitious price hike, and stingy launch promo compared to the past. But I was in the need of a new purely personal phone, and with the reviews praising the battery life front and back, I decided to still take the shot, luckily having saved up for how much I expected the 256GB model to cost.  Week 1, I loved it. Got a solid 9-10h of screen-on time with my normal use, and it was my first time ever going to sleep with the intention to charge the phone the next day. Mind-blowing. There were  a few minor issues which got solved with the first software update, but otherwise, it's genuinely the best phone I've ever owned, yet again. I did however, encounter an issue with RCS, that took TWO MONTHS to fix - my carrier providing all the info I'd ever need to resolve it with Google, but Google then just stonewalled me and told me to do what the previous rep told me to, despite the very previous email being a response to that.   The issue was never resolved. After about a month of use, the battery life just kept getting weaker and weaker, with the battery lasting \"only\" for the whole day, hitting 10% when I was heading to sleep, with only 4h of screen-on time. That's considerably worse than what I got on the Pixel 7 Pro. What the hell??   There was also the Android 15 update, which only introduced the same annoying bugs that wouldn't get fixed for two updates that I had with the Pixel 7, which is unacceptable when you're paying 1100\u20ac+ for a smartphone. Quoting a colleague, \"if it doesn't give you head for that price, it's a waste of money\". Next up is the camera. What happened to the zoom quality?? I took a picture of a car in the Ikea parking lot at 10x, and the asphalt looked sharper than the car itself - if you zoomed in, it looked like some AI-generated asphalt texture that's just a repeating texture with the wrong perspective. On top of the fact that this phone tends to oversaturate EVERYTHING. And let's not get started with how awful the stabilization is in any situation where you're not still. I expect better. On the bright side - for the battery issues, I've sent the phone in for repair, and the RMA was accepted. I'm suspecting it's a bad modem - it's my only explanation for how it could be this bad with daily use. Props to Google for actually taking it in instead of stonewalling me again, but having these issues on a 1000\u20ac+ smartphone is again, unacceptable. I do hope not many people are having issues with them. For a phone that's 1) gotten a considerable price hike this year 2) no longer has good value deals and 3) has the exact same kinds of issues as my now two-generations-behind Pixel 7 Pro, it's just way too overpriced. Even the Black Friday deals absolutely sucked for my region, 50\u20ac off a 1100\u20ac 128GB base model? Seriously??All of the issues combined with the price hike and the sour experience with Google overall these past few months, caused me to decide to sell my Pixel 9 and get an iPhone instead. I'm done with Pixels for personal use, and genuinely cannot in my right mind recommend anyone to get a Pixel - even if it's like me and it's for \"3-4 years\". The price just plain isn't worth it for what the phone offers.Hopefully Google gets their shit together by the next time I'm buying a phone for work. Tldr;The Pixel 9 Pro is great, but I can't recommend it in any right mind. Too many issues for a too high of a cost.

I need to share my wife's frustrating experience with Google's recent Pixel 4a \"Battery Performance\" update. You know, the one where Google forced an update that bricked her perfectly good phone and then gave her $100 credit as \"compensation\"? Well, buckle up, because it gets worse.Here\u2019s what happened:1. The Issue: Like many others, my wife's Pixel 4a was essentially ruined after Google's mandatory forced update.\u00a0Google\u2019s handling of this update has created waves of frustration across its user base. Battery life? Toast. Usability? Gone. Her once-reliable phone was rendered useless.\u00a02. The \u201cFix\u201d: Google offered $100 store credit to use toward a new Pixel device. Fine, we thought\u2014not ideal, but at least it's something, right?3. The Catch: We went to the Google Store to buy a Pixel 8a that was already on sale. But when we tried to redeem the $100 credit, the system wouldn\u2019t let us\u2026 because the phone was \"already discounted.\"Let me say that again: Google gave my wife $100 credit because they broke her phone\u2026 but won\u2019t let her use it to buy the replacement device because it\u2019s on sale. The sale price has nothing to do with the situation\u2014this is supposed to be compensation, not a coupon!1. Google\u2019s Support Response: We reached out to customer support (full transcript here: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/w3uBueZ) ). We explained that this isn\u2019t a typical promo code\u2014it\u2019s a voucher to make up for their forced update ruining her phone. After being bounced around and asked to \"try incognito mode\" (seriously?), they ultimately said they couldn\u2019t help us. When we attempted to further explain the situation, they abruptly disconnected the chat without resolving anything.The excuse? \"Promo codes cannot be combined with other promotions.\" But nowhere in the terms does it say that this credit can\u2019t be used on a sale item. Even worse, others have apparently been able to use their vouchers on discounted phones. Why the inconsistency?1. Adding Insult to Injury: If she had chosen the $50 cash option instead of the $100 store credit, she wouldn\u2019t have been restricted like this. The $100 store credit is essentially Google saying, \"We\u2019re sorry for ruining your phone, but please consider buying a Pixel again.\" Yet when we try to, they make it as difficult as possible.2. Even Worse: To add fuel to the fire, we\u2019re now seeing reports from others who, after being refused the ability to use their store credit, are also being denied the option to go back and choose the $50 cash alternative. So not only is the credit worthless in many cases, but once you\u2019ve picked it, you\u2019re stuck with it.My Takeaway: This \"compensation\" is essentially worthless if my wife can\u2019t use it to buy the replacement phone it\u2019s meant for. Google\u2019s update broke her phone, and now they\u2019re nickel-and-diming us on their so-called solution. It\u2019s insulting.Here\u2019s the simple solution Google should offer:* Option 1: Let her uninstall the update and return her phone to its previous, fully functional state.* Option 2: If that\u2019s not possible, honor your commitment and compensate her properly for her broken phone\u2014whether that means unrestricted store credit, cash, or a direct replacement.I wanted to share this here because:* Awareness: If you\u2019re dealing with the same issue, you\u2019re not alone.* Advice: If anyone\u2019s successfully navigated this nonsense, I\u2019d love to hear how you did it.* Accountability: Google needs to know this isn\u2019t okay. Their lack of support is unacceptable, and they need to do better.Let\u2019s make some noise. If you\u2019ve dealt with this or have thoughts, drop them in the comments. Google, if you\u2019re reading this: Fix this mess.We\u2019ve fallen in love with Pixel devices over the years because they\u2019ve been so reliable. We\u2019ve purchased several Pixels, trusting Google to deliver great products. But now, Google has destroyed that trust with how they\u2019re handling this issue.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"505":{"post_title":"What are some things you didnt know your Google Pixel could do?","self_text":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"506":{"post_title":"What makes you stick with Pixel?","self_text":"I've been a die-hard iPhone user since 2019.

But there's always that nagging thought of switching back to iPhone or trying a Samsung for the first time ever.So, Pixel fans, why do you stick with it?

As I browse this sub it seems like there\u2019s a lot wrong with the pixel line in general. So far I\u2019ve seen issues like battery, screen, not being able to text\/call, alarms not working. Before I shell out money I need to know if it\u2019s really that bad or if it\u2019s something to do with a crappy update or is it kind of like an echo chamber?

It's extremely smooth and fast in comparison to my aging Oppo A91. However, there are a couple of features that I wish Google could bring from their rivals:1. **Floating windows.**\u00a0This is perhaps, the feature that I miss the most. I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting my screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly. You have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on\/off the device.**\u00a0This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega\/giga bytes consumed per day.**\u00a0I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.**\u00a0This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: *Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app?* I sometimes get several notifications from Duolingo, but they are always split. I wish I could have all of them coming from one app in one place instead of several.Thanks for your ideas or extras that you wish you could also have!"},"509":{"post_title":"Bluetooth connection issues since the December 2024 Android 15 update.","self_text":"So both my wifes Mazda 3 2012 and my Mazda 6 2011 are having bluetooth connection issues.

JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on\/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on\/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too.

To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone.

I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive. They suggested waiting until Monday so it would be cheaper - around \u20ac500, especially if it\u2019s on the route of the maintenance guy. So here\u2019s my dilemma \u2013 should I take the risk and pay to retrieve it, hoping it\u2019s still alive and functional, or leave it there and cut my losses? It\u2019s a brand-new, expensive phone, but \u20ac500 is a lot of money if it\u2019s completely broken\u2026What would you all do? Anyone else ever been through this? Could my protective gear have saved my Pixel 9 Pro?[lift shaft ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TZTSg3a.png)Update #1:Spend 1 hour with my magnet on a stick to poke around the shaft, but it's way deeper than my stick could reach. Tried to use my flashlight on every side to see if it's on the ground somewhere, but was unable to spot it. I think I was able to see only 5% of the whole area.I'll make some calls tomorrow to the building manager and the lift shaft maintenance company!Update#2I tried for 2 days to get contact with the company that does the maintenance. Called like 5-10 times. They would call back etc, but never did.Last time I called I said: \"I've read about a fire hazard risk, because the Li-on battery could be broken and explode in a few days, I've read about this online, could you add this to the ticket and let your supervisor know about this?\".Looks like that worked, because they will be at the building this week!Update #3Today was maintainance day and they found the phone. They will hand it over to me tomorrow. But they already made a picture and video and told us it was completely crushed, not working etc. I'll post the pics when I have it!

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"514":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience","self_text":"Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"515":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL: Overpriced and Underwhelming in Europe?","self_text":"I'm really confused about what to do and whether it's worth continuing to use Pixel devices.

Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG).

The 5x optical zoom does the difference too.UI and UX: The pixel experience is perfect, no bloatware, attention to the detail, perfect UI, simple, easy to root or unlock bootloader if you're that kind of person, It all couldn't be better. Kudos to Google for that.Hardware and performance:CPU is great, GPU is not the best but can run any game at **max settings** **at at least 50fps**, this includes genshin impact and fortnite at max settings btw. The TPU allows for lightning quick ai photo perfection, recording summarization, audio s\u00e9paration in video, message remixing and more. Also 12gb ram which is perfect. Build quality: Couldn't be better the phone itself is smooth to the touch, beautiful, doesn't break easily if you don't throw it on the floor, stable on a flat surface despite the camera and moreScreen: Georgous, adaptative refresh rate means always on display consumes about 0.7% battery per day if always on. Adaptative refresh rate also triggers when content on the screen doesn't move aka when you read which makes the device last multiple days. It's also OLED of super AMOLED I forgot so the colors are perfect and accurate and beautiful.Overheating: Doesn't, heats just a little bit while heavy gaming but not that bad (not **over**heating)Fingerprint sensor: It's optical so if your screen is dirty or your finger is wet it won't work well and even sometimes when everything is right it won't work, it will tho if you set your main finger two times work perfectly every time except if wet or way too dirty.Face unlock: Everything perfect except it doesn't work in the dark if youre too far from your screen because not enough light. It also detects if your eyes are closed or if you're not looking at it in which case it wont unlock.Battery life: On TikTok lasts an average of nine hours because dynamic refresh rate can't kick in, on heavy gaming 5 for the same reason and also heavy processing, for light gaming 8 because the dynamic refresh rate cant kick in either and processing, while for reading it lasts multiple days. If you use this phone normally it will last one day or two before requiring to charge, it also has adaptative charging so if you charge at night and you setup bedtime mode it'll turn on bedtime mode disabling notification for the night and charging your phone to about 80% and then it'll charge slowly hitting 100% when your alarm rings, slow charging preserves battery. The part of this phone that consumes way too much battery is the modem which is not energy efficient (what connects to the cell tower) meaning that heavy networking will consume more battery.Software updates: 7 years of android updates and feature drops garrented. (More than iphone)Price: 900 bucks, not expensive for a device this quality.Do I recommend: If you're ready to put in the price to get a perfect phone that lasts 7 years, then yeah buy it I promise you you will never regret it. Else buy the 8 or 8a but expect worse battery life, camera and slightly worse build quality and 8gb ram instead of 12, but you'll get he same chip so same general performance except the phone will heat slightly more while gaming because of reduced size"},"519":{"post_title":"My terrible experience with my brand new Pixel 8a","self_text":"It has been a week since I got my new Pixel 8a and honestly my experience so far has been terrible, in all these years having smartphones I never had such a bad first week and I would never have imagined to have so many issues with a Pixel phone.1. When charging, the phone has a very strong and strange \"electrical\" friction all over the metal frame, it's clearly as there's some discharge on the metal frame (no, it's not static electricity because it happens only when I charge it).2. Notifications are delayed even if I turned off \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Adaptive Connectivity\": sometimes I get them only when I wake the phone (they start to pop up the moment I wake it), sometimes they simply don't show unless I open the app for which the notifications are delayed (e.g: I open Whatsapp, I get the messages notifications), I even missed a Whatsapp call without any notification. This is a pretty serious issue (which I never had with any other phone in the past), if my Pixel 8a can't be reliable on basic phone features, I don't know if I want to keep it.3. After the Android 15 update (two days ago), Google Play Services is running in background 100% of the time (i.e.: from midnight to 8am you'll see 8 hours background usage for Google Play Services in the battery details), draining the battery. I see at least 10% drain over 6-7 hours during the night.4. A Samsung fast charger that charges rapidly all other phones instead charges my Pixel 8a very slowly (3 hour for 20-30%), I even tried another cable but inexplicably the issue persists.5. Pixel support is quite absent, I contacted them for issue #1 and then updated them with issue #4 (since it's charging related), they asked for pictures of the frame in the support chat, then for other pictures of the frame in the support email, but then nothing, now it's 5 days that I don't have any answer. Now I'll send details about issue #3, but I don't feel good about this situation.Any idea on what to do or any help would be really appreciated, factory reset is not an option (eSIM would be lost, I would lose access to banking apps which need one device always active, and so on). EDIT: \u00a0I've updated both Google Play (open the app => Settings => About => Update Play Store) and Google Play Services (manually going to its Google Play page).  I think the phone is defective due to #1, but #2 and #3 are not HW issues, so I'm thinking about buying another phone and return this (support not answering of course is a factor in this decision, 7 days of the 14 days for returning it are already gone). It's a pity because I really wanted a Pixel, I always had \"near stock Android\" phones (Nexus S, Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G8, Moto G100) and I thought this would be a sure choice and a solid improvement, but I've read so many threads here of people complaining about #2 and #3 that I'm not sure I want to keep trying with this phone.Thanks in advance! \ud83e\udd17"},"520":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL Bluetooth in Car - No sound for incoming or outgoing calls","self_text":"So this happens to a friend and to me, we both have a pixel 9 pro xl.

Pixel Launcher is the bane of my 8 Pro. The fact that it freezes the buttons once every 3 days or so and I have to open settings to force stop it is ridiculous.2. The native phone app can't be linked to Textra. I have to exit Textra to make a phone call from the phone app. Otherwise it tries to make me select from options like Google voice. 3. The aggressive conservation of RAM limits how fast apps can access location\/Bluetooth in some instances. I have to use an app called LATCH occasionally and there's always a freeze, even if the app is already open.4. Even if phone updates keep rolling out, it seems like Google is ignoring some of the persistent issues that limit functionality on Pixels--similar to the way they handle issues on Google docs, Sheets, etc. The lack of responsive software support will eventually make the phones \"outdated\" even if the hardware is good enough to hang with new gen phones.5. There should be an option to switch the back and multi buttons on the bottom of the screen. I highly doubt this is related to an IP issue since both Samsung and OnePlus have the same setup. Not sure if this is an oversight or a weird ploy to keep the same user base upgrading to a Pixel instead of changing brands.Ultimately, I am very happy with the performance on the 8 Pro. It is fast, has plenty of processing power, and capabilities like default trickle charging to 100% battery in the morning is ingenious. On the other hand, while the trickle charge feature ensures that users will be able to use their phones longer by protecting against battery degradation, it's also an example of a baby bumper, and I miss having the freedom to do whatever I would like to my phone--even if it isn't optimal."},"522":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - unable to connect to car bluetooth, help?","self_text":"I just upgraded from P6P to P9Pxl, and everything has been great, except that I'm unable to connect to my car's bluetooth.

Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.

Let's see.    **Why I chose the 9 and not a different model** (or even an iPhone\/Samsung): I've had my 4a for almost exactly 4 years now. It's still in working order, no damage to it. Of course security updates stopped (I think last year). Battery still lasts me a whole day! However, I'm not a \"power user\". I don't play any games and only occasionally watch a video on YouTube, X or Instagram. I also almost never use Instagram.    The 4a's performance was honestly still fine. So, when looking at upgrading I noticed that a lot of new phones still come with just 8gb ram, even iPhone 16 is rumored to be coming with just 8gb ram. The 4a has 6gb I believe. Therefore, I didn't feel the 16gb with the Pro was necessary.     I'm also not a gamer, so I didn't feel I needed the advanced cooling in the Pro.    The zoom camera and better\/bigger selfie camera would've been nice, but I think that's really it for me.     I'm in Japan, and the Pro phones only come with 6 months of Gemini advanced. I also already did a trial of it, so there's a chance I might not have even gotten those 6 months.     I also considered the 8a. I decided against it because it seemed like the fingerprint sensor and facial unlock were a big upgrade on the 9. Those are actually useful features. Additionally, the fingerprint reader on the 4a was good, so I was worried the 8a might be a downgrade in that regard. That's something that might annoy me the life of the phone! There are also the stories of overheating.    The cameras also seemed to be improved somewhat from 8a to 9, and for basic use, that's important to me.     Last, the 8a only gave me about \u00a56,000 (\\~$41) for the 4a trade-in whereas the 9 gave me \u00a518,000 (\\~$124).    The 9 also seemed to be a nicer piece of hardware. It looks fantastic in my opinion.     **Review of 9:** It looks and feels like it's expensive. It's a little bit bigger than the 4a, but not so much that it's awkward to hold. The screen seems a lot more spacious though.    The screen is a lot nicer than the 4a. That's been a nice upgrade.    Battery life seems great so far. Much better than the battery that I assume is fading on my 4a.     Charging speed seems about the same? I've been using it three days and I charged it once (it came charged at around 60%). When I charged it, it went from 48% to 98% in one hour. I used my old pixel 4 charger and cable.    There are a few nice features in android that I didn't get on the 4a. Some more comprehensive safety stuff, double tap the back of the phone for an action of your choice (mine does a screenshot), flip the phone to put it in \"do not disturb\" mode, use the phone as a webcam and a couple of other things. Maybe they were there and I just never noticed the updates though.     I haven't really had a chance to play around with the cameras. However, I can say the selfie camera is a lot better on the 9 than the 4a. There are already lots of reviews about the cameras though.     Finally, performance. I might get a lot of backlash for this, but the app loading\/switching, web browsing, etc. is only a bit faster. Things seem smoother, but for what I do on the phone, I don't think \"speed\" has been that big of an upgrade.    I will say I was starting to have some problems with apps crashing or not responding sometimes on the 4a, and I haven't noticed that on this phone yet. So I guess reliability is better.     Regarding the phone's temperature, like a lot of people have reported, it got hot during setup.     While on the subway, browsing the web and listening to my earphones it gets a little warm after about 30 minutes, but not hot. Searching for signal might play into that, I don't know. Signal connectivity on my train route has unfortunately not improved.    I think that's it for now. I will say I'm a little nervous using it still sometimes because it's so expensive. I'm just not comfortable playing with a $1,000 piece of equipment on busy trains and what not. And it's not that I can't afford the phone, it's just much more expensive than any phone I've ever owned. The prices have gone up so much since 2020.    This phone was \u00a5129,000 ($891) and the pixel 4a was \u00a540,000 (about $424 with the 2020 exchange rate).    I really like the 9, but the price was a hard pill to swallow. In hindsight, I probably should've just gotten a new case to make my 4a look a little newer and waited for the 9a. I'm glad I didn't go for the Pro model.    These are just my opinions and my experiences! I'm not trying to take away anyone's happiness, we all see things differently and are in different situations. I'm happy for everyone enjoying their phones! This Pixel 9 is great!"},"529":{"post_title":"Google 9 Pro Impressions as an iPhone user","self_text":"Got my Pixel 9 Pro yesterday from Google in the mail and there are many many things that are fantastic about this phone. For context I'm coming from an iPhone 14.**The Good***This thing is fast*. I haven't used a pro phone before, but navigating the interface, opening the play store, downloading an app, opening it, everything feels incredibly snappy. I feel like I can just move so much quicker on this phone than my iPhone.*Material you is amazing*. One of the aspects of my iPhone that I loved the most was the beautiful design of its hardware, and of iOS. I remember using a Samsung for a while back in high school, and it was fine, but always felt that its design sorely lagged behind Apple. Pixel 9 pro's hardware is gorgeous, and the design of material you is a triumph, the pixel launcher is just a delight to use. From the bounciness of everything, to how response it is. There are so many little touches that make the experience feel engaging, and fun, in a way that Apple can't compete with. Having your theme replicated in all your other apps is really great too.*The screen is beautiful*. My iPhone also had an OLED screen, but would have red smearing when black objects were moving around on screen at low brightnesses, which was very distracting at night. This Pixel's screen has a great refresh rate, great colors, and great performance at high brightness and low brightness. I'm not a display expert, but I'm very happy with it.*It feels amazing in the hand*. Google's doing some magic with the materials on this phone, nearly every surface is a delight to hold.*Gemini Live is extremely impressive*. When you launch Gemini live, it has the ability to run in the background as you hold a conversation. Speaking with it is surprisingly natural, I launched it and had conversations with it about setting up various aspects of the phone. It's really, really good, I will be using this feature very frequently. I wish it was easier to launch directly though, it's not great to have to go through Gemini first. I would prefer to use Google assistant, and have the option to quick launch into Gemini Live. I'm sure if I did some tinkering I could figure something out. **The Bad***Gemini, in its current state, should not be the default assistant*. This morning, I asked Gemini to play some music on Spotify, something that Google Assistant does with ease, and instead of playing music, ... it generated **python code** for calling a mysterious music API. I asked it about some good technology podcasts that I could listen to, and it decided to reach out through its YouTube Music integration to put together a special playlist for me... of random songs from YouTube Music. At the moment Gemini is the center of everything, and it reaches out to Google Assistant if it needs help. I really think that this relationship should be inverted. Google Assistant should reach out to Gemini as a last resort. Coming from iPhone though, both Gemini and Google Assistant are wiping the floor with Siri. For the time being, I've set Google Assistant to my default assistant.*Slow charging*. To be seen how much of an issue this is, but my iPhone was able to consistently get up to about 50% in around half an our of charging. Pixel seems to charge a lot slower than that. Battery life has been on about on par subjectively.Let me know if you all have any questions and I'll be happy to answer them!"},"530":{"post_title":"Android 15 update, Bluetooth issues - Pixel 6","self_text":"Pixel 6 boy here.Android pushed the Android 15 OS update the other day and ever since my Bluetooth is very unstable when connecting to the car, but for audio (music) only.The telephone function still works as expected, although I will note there are extra notes and tones when a call ends, and reminds me as though the phone was plugged in via aux as opposed to Bluetooth, however my buttons on the steering wheel still control the hang up and answer call function.The biggest problem is the audio connection. I have to go into Bluetooth settings, select my device, and repeatedly disconnect and reconnect until it finally settles on a connection it's happy with.I was googling and followed the suggestion to forget my car from the device list and then try to re-pair, unfortunately now it won't pair with the car. I'm not ruling out the chances that it's a problem with the OEM radio in the car, but that is the constant, and the phone is the device that has changed and I have only experienced this since the update.Has anyone else with a Pixel 6 had the same issue?

Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https:\/\/imgur.com\/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons\/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my \"Google\" folder is [even bigger](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify\/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+\/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a \u00a31400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."},"532":{"post_title":"Pixel 8, does your Bluetooth suck?","self_text":"I just got a Pixel 8 (upgraded from a 6 after it died a horrible death).

I have been through several Android smartphones, from Samsung Galaxy S2 to OnePlus7. I have been through them all. Although I wasn't very happy with all Android smartphones, I personally feel my OnePlus7 purchase was the best.The reason why I love Android because I hate ads and on Android I can root my smartphone and block ads at a DNS level. That's the only reason I never moved to an iPhone.I love stock Android and prefer to install lineage but as with all third party ROMs, some functionality or the other gets broken. Hence, this time I decided to buy a Pixel as it would come with a stock ROM and the only thing I would need to do is root my smartphone and install an ad blocking apk thereby creating the perfect device.I bought the Pixel 8 on September 2023 and I truly regret my purchase. It is an absolute piece of garbage and the entire Pixel team in Google should honestly be sorry for creating such a piece of garbage. The below are my issues with Pixel 8.1. Heating - This phone heats like crazy when I use it on 5G. One of the reasons I upgraded to Pixel 8 from OnePlus 7 was because OnePlus 7 did not support 5G. However, after seeing the heating issue on 5G, I was forced to keep my device on LTE which negated the whole purpose of buying this device. I suspect some of this heating has to do with Google's tensor chip which is very subpar compared to Apple's in house SoC and even Qualcomm's SoC. I don't know they developed tensor? Just because Apple has their own SoC, I guess?2. Lag and bugs - Several popular apps such as Swiggy (food delivery app in India) and other apps lag like crazy on this device. This issue has been confirmed by others as well. There is a random bug on instagram which causes brightness to increase to max for certain reels which is very weird to say the least.3. Build and screen size - Screen size is smaller and build is heftier than usual. I hate holding this device. At a time when other manufacturers have moved towards less bezel and more display, Google has gone the opposite way.4. App switcher button not working - This is the craziest bug of them all. The app switch button simply doesn't work. I have realized that this has been a recurrent issue with Pixel phones and something Google simply refuses to address? I mean what kind of snobby head in their a\\*\\*\\* kind of engineers does Google have that they simply do not address such a simple bug for years together? Even low quality Chinese OEMs do a better job at fixing simple bugs like these on their device and here we have the \"flagship\" Google phone for which there is no fix. I pay iPhone equivalent price for such a piece of shit.5. Useless AI gimmicks - Instead of nailing down the basics of what makes a good phone, Google has decided to stuff it with useless AI gimmicks which 99% of people are never going to use. I have personally not used a single one of them.WORST OF IT ALL COMES BELOW.5. After sales service - There is literally negligible after sales service for Pixel, at least in India. I started seeing a pink line on my display and gave it to the service center which is authorized by Google. Anyone wants to guess the TAT? 15 DAYS !!! Yes, not 15 hours, 15 DAYS. There is no replacement device provided and the service center is a third party center which doesn't even pick my calls on most days and all Google reviews for Pixel for this service center is 1 star. For my OnePlus7, the battery had worn off and they replaced the same within 2 hours. Just 2 hours. That's it.Conclusion - I made a blunder spending $700 on Pixel 8 over here in India. It is half my monthly salary. I don't even know if I will ever get my phone back from the service center, even if I do, I don't want to use it for more than a year before I switch to iPhone for good. I will watch some ads but at least I will have a much better phone to use.  Edit - The downvotes are crazy, it is because of die hard fanboys like you that Google and its Pixel team gets away with such a shitty phone. If this were a third party OEM who built such a phone at such a price, they would be bankrupt by now. Anyhow, keep funding the snobs at Google.

This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13\" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it \"exciting\"? Not really. But its out of my way and out of my mind, it just works, and if it doesn't, I don't notice it."},"539":{"post_title":"I actually like my Pixel 8 Pro","self_text":"Had my phone now for two months.

I also rock a Samsung S20 5G, which coupled the weak CPU in the Pixel 5. I now have a single device to tinker on.Camera is almost flawless. I mean, no camera is perfect, but so far it's definitely the best camera on a phone I've had my hands on (admittedly, I avoid Apple). Photos and videos are of outstanding, professional quality and that's before editing it.Battery is flipping awesome. From the overuse of my P5 and S20, their batteries are not holding up as much, so charging became commonplace. I still use the S20 for some things and each time I go to put it on charge, the Pixel 8P still has over 70% left (after 12 or more hours). Have played CoD and Metalstorm a lot (at high res and 60fps), even over 5G and the battery still holds it's own. Device does get warm, I'd be rather worried if it didn't with what it was doing!UI\/UX. Well, it's classic Android as always. Under the hood Google have added some cool AI features and gestures. Double tap to back takes some fiddling over the P5, but I am wearing a shock case on the P8P. I had to turn off the animations, mind (Developer Menu or via Accessibility). They were too smooth\/slow for my liking, I prefer a snappy UI. I have switched to using Nova (8.x) as my launcher and use 3 button navigation (am an old timer, so shhh! \ud83d\ude02).Biometrics. Well, I don't know what it wrong with everyone else, but I even have a hardened glass on my P8P and have had an easy 98\/100 success rate. I do prefer either back or side mounted, but the under screen does come in useful when you can't pick up phone. Fortunately, the S20 has screen fingerprint, so had time to get used to one. Oh and it has face unlock, which seems to know when you're using a photo instead of a person. This creeped me out with one of my banking apps. Opened it, looked away as it loaded, looked back to see my balances \ud83d\ude16. If you have a Pixel watch, you can even unlock your phone from watch.Network. I use two SIMs (eSIM+SIM) on this. One is very 5G available and the other is mostly used for calls and texts, as well as backup data. The phone is mostly on cell, 5G being very common. The other network does have 5G, but only in some areas (EE UK and Vodafone UK). I did this with my Pixel 5 as well as my S20 (have at least two different networks, giving me access to all 4 MNO's in the UK (Three, O2, EE, Vodafone)). Despite what I've read of others, I don't experience overheating or excessive battery drain. I will admit, the phone did not like one of my WiFi 5 WPA3 only access points. Just outright refuses to connect to it. Every other AP and it's fine. Speed of both 4G\/5G and WiFi 5 are as expected. Haven't tested a 6\/6e AP, yet.Power user friendliness. It's a frigging beast! I've thrown all kinds of shenanigans at it. Compiled a few wheels in Termux for python, as well as some ham radio tools and onboard AI and it storms through. Tasker is doing a variety of things based on conditions and events, including reactions to the logcat. With 9 cores and 12GB RAM, it has welly to go wading all day long. Neither have been terminated in background and phantom processes aren't killed. I used my S20 for most of this, as it has 12GB RAM, too. Now it's all being offloaded to the Pixel as it's just outright faster. Still waiting to test out UWB, too.Questions? Please do ask.

It has been my first ever pixel and I have always had a great deal of respect for clean stock android, so naturally my expectations were pretty high going in. But my experience has been far from perfect. Summarizing my gripe with the phone in thebpoints below-1. Camera Over-processing: Pixels are well known for their cameras. But boybdoes it over process every single image to the point that colors, skin tones, WB and lighting are drastically affected. There's a serious amount of ahutter lag, and the camera often slows down to the point that I have to wait for more than 5 seconds before I can take the next image. This lag is particularly noticable in portrait mode. Coming from both Samsung and iPhone, this is a massive disappointment.2. Choppy Performance: I expected stock android to be buttery smooth. But stutters and slow downs are often noticable. This is not a major issue or a deal breaker, but rather annoying and something I wasn't expecting at all.3. Cellular Network & Call Quality: This is laughably bad. Making and receiving phone calls is almost a nighmarish experience. Calls deop, get muted or don't come in at all. Just stay away from this phone if you rely heavily on voice calls.4. UI Glitches: There are often UI glitches which are really unexpected, such as screen blackouts, touch unresponsiveness, audio glitches, gallery app getting blurry and stuck after deleting a couple of photos and so much more. Samsung's UI is so much more polished, which is really surprising and laughable as stock android is like the ground that all other phone manufacturers stand on.5. Missing Content: This is by far the worst thing that has happened to me. So I have been doing a lot of gaming lately, mostly PS2 emulation on AetherSX2. i decided to record some footage using the default screen recorder, and what do you know, some of the videos saved and some didn't! I mean what the actaul ****. Who the hell does my content go missing? Is the processor that bad that it cannot keep up with something as simple as a screen recording? I did some research on Google and found that it's been happening to others as well, particulary people who record high res 4k video on the native camera app. Fine these are only screen recordings, but if I were to lose any precious memories because of this phone, I would have smashed it on the ground.I wrote this whole thing out of frustration. There are other issues with the phone as well that I cannot recall at the moment. I am done with Pixel and will be going back to a Samsung."},"543":{"post_title":"No audio through Android Auto (Pixel 9 Pro XL)","self_text":"Edit:  SOLVED!  u\/Squintz82 posted [this](https:\/\/support.google.com\/androidauto\/thread\/312020339\/no-audio-via-android-auto-after-december-2024-feature-drop?hl=en) which lead me in the right direction of what to enable. I use the feature for disabling your microphone\/camera often and enabling it fixed the problem.    For the past few months, I've had no audio when connecting my phone to Android Auto and I'm completely out of ideas of what to try. I've tried it with multiple cars and the issues persists. Other phones don't have this issue in the same cars. I'm using it via a cable and not bluetooth (don't have access to a car which supports bluetooth AA so no way to test that).Tested multiple cables with no difference. Can get the actual AA screen to show up in the car with no problem, it's purely audio that does not work and it's starting to become a real headache. It seems to have happened around the time I updated to Android 15 so I figured I'd wait to see if any updates fix it, which it hasn't."},"544":{"post_title":"Pixel 8a is amazing.","self_text":"Yeah, I'm gonna straight up say it. The Pixel 8a is an amazing phone.I used the Galaxy A33 for just over a year and I needed a change. I don't really like iOS and I'm tired of Galaxy phones. I wanted a smooth, stock Android experience and two brands came in mind: Nothing and Google. However as a person who prefers smaller phones, I leaned towards the Pixel for its smaller form factor. To be honest I was quite worried about VoLTE support in my country because it is not released here in Korea. Also I saw many posts on this subreddit saying that the modem and processor in Pixels in general have terrible power efficiency. I bought it for \u20a9580000 incl. Tax ($429) and I have to say it was an awesome choice. The display is super bright, stock Android experience is awesome. Design is nice too, I got the Bay color and I love the amount of saturation. Performance was decent; of course raw performance won't be Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 grade, but the optimization and 120Hz display make it feel super fast and snappy. Cameras produced great photos with realistic colors. Battery was for me not amazing on screen on but lasted for a long time in standby, but it's only been a day since I started using it so I'll keep an eye on it. I was too lazy to patch the VoLTE but 3G calling works just fine. I don't call often anyway.Also, the attention to detail in stock Android is unmatched. The animations, for example when waking the phone with the power button differs from waking with a tap. And haptics are top grade.So happy that I got this."},"545":{"post_title":"Okay, I want to stop rooting my Pixel devices. Can I still accomplish these things without root?","self_text":"My current device is a Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is bootloader locked until I've been with my carrier for 60 days, after which I can unlock and run a custom ROM or root or whatever. In the meantime, I've been rethinking my reasons for rooting in the first place.I've been rooting my phones - mostly Pixel devices - for the better part of a decade. I have my reasons and, in the past, they were pretty valid since there was no workaround for most of them. Now, though, I feel like I might be able to get away without root. Note: I don't use banking apps or Wallet or anything else with my phone that looks for root, so that's never been a problem.##Ad-blocking without a VPN##I sometimes need to use a VPN and so relying on ad-blocking via the VPN route is a non-starter. I have become aware of the \"Private DNS\" setting that's been available for the past couple of versions of Android (which I missed because I was always using AdAway, anyway). Will using something like *dns.adguard-dns.com* accomplish the same as AdAway?##Unlimited Google Photos upload##The ethics of it are irrelevant; I want to continue spoofing my phone so I can get unlimited, full-quality uploads to Google Photos. In the past, I have used the [Pixelify sub-module](https:\/\/www.pling.com\/p\/2004615\/) and while it's not perfect (the app pesters me to update all the time), it does the job. It does appear that there's [ReVanced GPhotos](https:\/\/github.com\/Unofficial-Life\/revanced-gphotos-build) that doesn't require root and just relies on [GmsCore](https:\/\/github.com\/microg\/GmsCore).##Automatic call recording##This seems to be a big one due to the difference in laws by state, country, region, whatever. Where I live, however, does not require two-party consent for those in the same state and so I very much want to enable automatic call recording for numbers not in my contacts list. It's up to me to inform the other person if they're in another state. Anyway, I have used Pixelify for this in the past, though it's caused issues at times and so have also used [Basic Call Recorder (BCR)](https:\/\/github.com\/chenxiaolong\/BCR).

Or ending a call and closing the phone app yet the call is still connected and open. The fact I have to manually switch to a wired microphone when recording a video drives me absolutely insane considering it resets to the phones terrible internal mic if you switch apps or the screen times out.  Video and photo capabilities are mediocre.  The battery does so so fast that I need to be plugged in everywhere I go.The phone is slow.  Image and video processing is such a crawl I would rather just use a real camera and forget trying to use the phone in the moment. I would rather carry another 10lbs around instead of dealing with the laggy and crappy processing.Sound quality is straight ass.  Sometimes it's ok, mostly it just clips even at 3\/4 or less volume.Bluetooth connectivity is garbage Modem is garbageThe updates are garbage and always add more problems.I've used pixel since the 2, and for a time it was exciting with every update being useful and adding nice features, not taking them away and making things worse.  The camera was great until the 5.  After that it's just been this pile of steamy trash.These phones are just bad now when compared to others in the space.  Unfortunately what makes them so bad is Google itself taking things away or adding garbage no one asked for.I use my phone for business and utility and I told myself if my experience did not get better with the 9, I would switch eco systems.  My decision is not just based on the phone, but the supporting system itself.  I absolutely and completely hate Apple, but you know what.. It's sure looking tempting to cross back over.  If Samsung didn't have Bixby, I would never own another Pixel.  That's just fact. I really want to love the Pixel again along with the echo system it's attached to.  I want to be all Google.  However, the years of taking features and applications away, not improving things and just making them worse, I can't handle it anymore. I've had every pixel from the 2 on since release, and after the 4, every year has been a downgrade.  Sorry, not sorry.

After contacting Google support multiple times and following their advice to check with neighbors and wait, I was told to have DHL conduct an investigation. Google insisted that the package was delivered, despite my claims that it was not. I emphasized my rights under EU consumer law and requested a replacement or refund. Google continued to redirect me to DHL, maintaining that they bore no responsibility. After numerous emails and calls, I feel frustrated & believe I was robbed of 399 euros without receiving the product.Update: After chatting with DHL, I confirmed that the shipment is still under investigation & that no signature was required for the specific shipment. After informing Google, they still claim that no refund or replacement is happening! Truly terribly sorry of ever using anything Google at this point.Here is the full story line:* **January 2:** Decided to buy the Google Pixel 8a as a gift for my loved one based on the fact I have the 7a and I like it.

I went out to check the mailbox & around the apartment complex, no package was found. I contacted Google Store help center right after.* **January 5 - 04:00 am**: Google help center suggested I wait until January 7th and ignore the delivery status as sometimes it is wrong as well as to check with neighbors.* **January 5** : I checked with all of the neighbors even the ones across, no one seen the package.* **January 7**: I try contacting DHL and they tell me that an investigation can only be made by the sender (Google)* **January 7 - end of day**: I reply to the email conversation with Google support in order to tell them that nothing arrived and that they need to start an investigation.

Do you have a watch you like that pairs to your Pixel phone and has the features below? What are the best options in terms of cost effectiveness? Come at me with all your opinions! These are the features I'm looking for (generally in order of importance):* **Alarms** - notifies me on the watch when an alarm goes off on my phone, able to **view the alarm label** (e.g., \"don't forget to bring \\_\\_\\_ to work\") on my watch, able to **silence or snooze** the alarm from my watch. To clarify -- I DO NOT want just a \"reminder\" or a Google calendar event notification, I need an alarm to continuously vibrate or make a specific sound on my wrist until I look at it and manually shut it off, otherwise I will ignore it after a few weeks.* **Watch will ping phone** - option from my watch to play a sound when I can't find my phone (it would also be nice if it showed an icon on the watch face if it was connected to my phone via bluetooth or not, so I know automatically if I've forgotten it somewhere).* **Voice assistant for alarms\/timers** - e.g., \"Hey google set an alarm\/timer for...\" FROM the watch (I have Amazon prime, but have never used Alexa and am confused how that would translate to adding the alarm\/texting someone from my phone as well)* **Voice assistant for sending and responding to texts** - I also schedule texts for a future time a decent amount, so it would be great it that feature worked as well, but I can live without it)* Able to **answer calls** on my watch.

However, it's helpful to receive *some* notifications on my watch (but not too many or I just tune them out because I don't have time to look at them).* **30+ hr battery life** - I will definitely *only* charge it once every 24hrs and do not want it to be notifying me of low battery for a few hours every day* **Raise wrist to wake OR clock face constantly on (if has decent battery life)** - I check the time frequently on my wrist* **Not a giant watch face size** - I am a small woman with pretty small wrists and some of the watch faces are really bulky and uncomfortable.

Also, every single one of them always had some degree of case defect, as the lid didn't align to the rest of the case, making an awful sound when closing. Hey, at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 10-20 days, it wasn't too bad after all. Well, unfortunately issues didn't end there. Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues? Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one. And the only way to fix this was\u2026 to stop any audio coming from them, wait for a couple of seconds, and then play again. Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing? It was horrible, silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds. Anyways, issues persisted all the time I've owned them and recently new ones started appearing, such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does. Well, this of course only happens when I'm just listening to anything, because when I'm in a call they only last 15-20 minutes. And last but not least, some of these buds sometimes think they're charging when they're actually not, and sometimes they think the case is open while it's actually not.Before anyone says anything, yes I've contacted multiple times Google support, even with Google One, and they always had the same troubleshooting process: charge them and factory reset them. Needless to say this didn't work ever.Anyways, yes this looks like a rant and it probably is. These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google, they have absolutely awful support and they're terrible on every aspect. I've also never owned any other wireless earbuds before, so I can't even say they're terrible compared to X. No, they're terrible, period. All this, for an even more awful price tag of 200 \u20ac. That's disgusting. And no, I'm not trying to boycott Google. I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch, and they're great. Great price (not so much for the watch, but if we compare it to Apple's\u2026) and great functionalities.

I'd had android phones in the past, but switched to iPhone bc I was sick of the difficulties in texting iPhone users (including all of my friends and family) but when I saw that Apple was going to add RCS support this year, I decided to finally switch back to Android.I was very excited to go back because I had greatly missed all of the customization options available for Android phones that iPhone didn't offer. However, ever since I've made the switch, I've dealt with one problem after the other, and it's becoming impossible to set them all aside. Here's a summary of my grievances:- **Bluetooth connections break**: I have AirPods, and I use them A LOT. Ever since I got my Pixel, I've had problems with their connection. What's happens is, if I pause whatever I'm watching\/listening to for more than a few seconds, there's a 50% chance the audio playback will just stop. The song or video will keep playing as normal, but no sound will come out (AirPods still appear as connected in Bluetooth settings). SOMETIMES it will fix itself in a couple seconds, but usually the only thing I can do is disconnect from and reconnect to the AirPods in the Bluetooth settings. This is EXTREMELY frustrating because I never had this issue with my iPhone. I don't think it's the fault of the AirPods bc I have 2 pairs, and it does the same with both, and it also happens with my car radio.- Phone becomes extremely slow\/laggy: This happens somewhat randomly \u2014 usually when I'm opening a lot of apps or something. I'd be more forgiving because this is pretty normal behavior for any device that I give many tasks, but this started happening very shortly after I got the phone. Usually I just restart it to fix this.- Phone launcher goes completely blank: Sometimes, all of the icons and everything but my background disappear (apps, widgets, notifications, and everything are gone). However, I'm still able to interact with everything. *If I remember the layout well enough, I can still open apps and everything.* This happens only when I'm interacting with the app drawer in a specific way. *I don't remember exactly how, something like opening and swiping an app away too quickly maybe.* The only way I've found to fix this is by restarting the phone (although it did fix itself once).- Screen scratches easily: Shortly after getting the phone, I've noticed a couple of small, deep scratches accumulate on the screen. This never happened with my iPhone, and I don't treat it any differently. I don't keep keys or anything metal in my pocket.I still don't think I'm going to go back to iPhone, but all of these things make me question if Pixel is the way to go for me. The rest of these things, I could set aside, but the Bluetooth problems are intolerable because of how frequently I use my AirPods. It's especially frustrating because I've never had an issue like this before, and Google has done nothing about it, despite it clearly being a software issue on their end. I've seen others complain about the same thing online for a while now, and nothing's been done.EDIT: **Turning on the \"Developer options\" setting, \"Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload\", has *mostly* resolved the problem of my airpods' audio disconnecting**. It has occurred at least once or twice in the weeks since turning that setting on, but it's still a massive improvement!

I wasn't sure what was it, but he didn't have anything else with him. It was before he suddenly said \"I actually have another parcel for you. It's in the car, just wait here for a moment.\" That must have been the watch I thought. The driver went to his car and I followed him to the main street where I could see where he parked. At that point, I was ready to snap a video or photo of him and the car if he decided to just drive away with my watch. But thankfully he came back with a long brown box and handed it over to me. No apology no explanation why it wasn't with him the first time he came to drop off my parcel. Given the circumstances, it's difficult not to think negatively of him. He might honestly forget about my other parcel (the watch) but then again he didn't seem apologetic and the fact that he suddenly 'remembered' he had another parcel for me in his car was very suspicious.Not sure if I should report this to the courier company.

I've had my Pixel 8 Pro for maybe 4 months now. I switched from a Galaxy S10 that I LOVED but was showing it's age pretty hard. I watched reviews and did some research and decided that the pixel seemed solid, but I swear this thing is a buggy mess compared to the S10 and I don't know if it's ME or the phone. None of the reviewers talked about this, basically every single one of them just said \"it's a good phone and the camera is good :)\"Issues so far:During the phone transfer, none of my photos kept their folders and nothing is sorted by date anymore. Google photos fucking sucks. Texts didn't transfer and I had to manually move them overBluetooth barely works and I have to restart my phone fairly often to get it to come back.I went to \"capture more\" on a screenshot, System UI crashed and reset my home and lock screens. Restarted and it came back.Sometimes on a phone call with a business that has a phone tree, it'll give me the options in text and let me skip the talking to go to who I want, but only sometimes. No clue on how to get it to do that consistently.Why isn't there a built in equalizer? Samsung had that baked into settingsIt doesn't automatically insert authentication codes when they get texted to me, except for when it does. Samsung had no issues doing it always.Clipboard straight up doesn't work. I can copy something and it'll tell me it's empty still despite being enabled.Searching for people or conversations in the messages app doesn't work and will give me people that I didn't even type a single letter of their names OR will give me a result for a conversation I had in 2014.I can't add apps to my lock screen corners. I can't add folders or even sort the app tray. Using the finger print sensor at night is a flashbang.Why is turning flash on and off in the camera suddenly hidden in a menu?Wireless charging basically doesn't work.

you transfer your messages from your old device, they often appear as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d in Google Messages.\u00a0 This eventually resolves itself, albeit still with some bugs.\u00a0 Also, Google One may prompt you to transfer MMS again.\u00a0 In my experience, doing this will create a duplicate of every image\/video and causes Google Messages to get much slower.**-----------Here are the issues I\u2019ve discovered through the process of transferring my messages (SMS, MMS, RCS) from my Pixel 8 Pro to my Pixel 9 Pro XL.\u00a0\u00a0**Read this if you transferred your messages from an old device but the images in your chat threads are showing up as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.**During initial setup, you can transfer the following from your old device to your new device.\u00a0 Transferring from your old device (in lieu of restoring from a Google One backup) is supposedly the only way to transfer RCS as-is (instead of them being converted to MMS).\u00a0\u00a0* Apps* Contacts* SMS messages* MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now reports that it contains over 70,000 messages. (Although if I view the backup in the app, it lists only around 50,000 messages, so maybe something is kinda broken.)(2)  You cannot see images and videos when you view the conversation details from within a specific chat thread.(3)  If you open an image from the search bar in Google Messages and tap \u201cSee in chat\u201d, it\u2019ll bring you to a random chat thread (mine brings me to a 2FA text thread from Lowe\u2019s, for every picture I\u2019ve tried).\u00a0 When I go to \\[...\\] > Details in that thread, all the images show up; however, they don\u2019t actually appear in the thread, only in that Details screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the 5-digit phone number for these 2FA codes may be the first to appear numerically in the database?(4)  [This article](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/08\/23\/pixel-9-google-messages-rcs-transfer\/) suggests updating your old device to the beta version of Google Messages before doing the transfer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do that and think it\u2019s ridiculous that it should be necessary.**CONCLUSION:**It appears that Google Messages is now integral to the transfer process, presumably because they\u2019re trying to transfer RCS messages as-is.\u00a0 After the transfer, you\u2019ll see that your Google Messages app storage consumes multiple GB while your Phone and Messaging Storage app database consumes almost nothing.\u00a0 Normally, the latter is at least a few GB because that\u2019s where MMS \/ text media are stored.\u00a0 Over time, things seem to migrate from the Google Messages app storage into the Phone and Messaging Storage app, but there are still bugs, as described above."},"578":{"post_title":"Can't apply pixel 4a $100 store credit to purchase a 8a","self_text":"I have a 4a with the dreaded battery issue, I opted for the $100 google store credit instead of fixing a phone no longer supported by updates.

The issue in my case is because I had kept Battery Saver On.I turned it off and phone returned to 5G without any problem..Have to contact Phone Support to close my case as they are working on it.So.. to all facing the issue..

There's one specific problem that's been a bit of a headache, though, which is that my USB-C-to-3.5mm adapters (a straight adapter, and a splitter with a charging port) both introduce a pretty significant hissing noise that stays at a steady volume, and is worse on the splitter.  On top of that, my dad was kind enough to let me test some Bluetooth airpods of his to check, and they *also* hiss noticeably.So, my question is, is there a solution to this?

Any specific recommendations?  Or even better, any relatively easy way to kill the hiss in the 3.5mm adapter?

Firstly, the design is pretty good. The camera row gives me Bender vibes. It makes for a recognizable look but I miss the glossy top of the 3. Transferring my data was a breeze but that's to be expected. The display and overall phone size was startling and the phone is pretty heavy (with my case) but I got used to it. Sometimes I even use it to work out my arm \ud83d\ude02. There's just the bezel at the bottom of the screen that's bigger than the top one for some reason. I have a screen protector so I don't w~~ant to ~~even know how strong the Gorilla Glass is. I did drop my 3 a couple times though, and and it only ended up with one crack on one of the bottom corners, so I would assume this one's stronger.  The power button did fall out just around a week after I got this phone but I fixed it recently with the warranty, so that's there.    Display is great, but it has this green tint when viewed from a weird angle. I don't think my Pixel 3 had this. But it's not a problem at all. 90 Hz refresh rate is apparently so smooth my friends pointed it out. Maybe I've just been used to it. Couldn't care less about the notch (or camera hole) as long as I get more screen space. Plus, it makes for some creative wallpapers.    I'm not a camera person so this section will be brief. The cameras are good enough to take pictures with; zooms really far. I don't know enough about cameras to really say. Maybe they're actually better than I think.  The funny thing is the main reason I even got a new phone was because the single camera on the 3 randomly became blurry so it's ironic I didn't write more on the camera. When I get the chance to I'll try the other features like Cinematic Mode and the Photo Unblur.    I'm also not a audiophile so what I say might not be a complete review. The audio quality is pretty okay, but I do miss the front facing speakers on the 3. Yes, I know there's a speaker at the top but it's not that powerful. I think it's for when your phone isn't on speaker in a call. I didn't even notice it was there until a couple days later. Since phone cases will make a cutout of the bottom speakers, it's even easier to cover it with your fingers when watching a video or playing games. I feel like there's never a quiet sound for media volume at least. Even the lowest setting is kinda loud but that's okay. I use  wireless earbuds (Google's very own) so I'm kinda just nitpicking. All in all, no problem.    With performance, this is my first time using Google Tensor so I can't tell if the G2 is an upgrade from the original. The phone is smooth and responsive but I do notice it gets really hot when playing games. I hardly play games anymore so this isn't a problem and sometimes I can't even tell if the temperature is rising because of the case I use. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's from my hands or from the phone itself. Not gonna lie, for a phone that has double the RAM of my previous, I was expecting more processing power because sometimes when switching apps they refresh unexpectedly. It mainly happens when opening the camera app camera app. How taxing is it?!?!    Speaking of speed, the fingerprint scanner is not as fast or smart as I'd want it to be. It sometimes doesn't recognize my thumb even when it's laying flat on my screen! If the 7 is this bad, I don't want to imagine the 6. I heard some updates messed up the sensor but I'm not so sure that's true. If it is then subsequent updates should be able to fix it. When the fingerprint reader doesn't work, I switch to face unlock. I think it's more consistent than the fingerprint sensor but it seldom works in low light or when I take my glasses off, so I find myself using the PIN. I use Extend Unlock to limit the failed attempts and it's a game changer. I have it for when my phone is at home. The fingerprint scanner is still important for authenticating important transactions though.    I know people have problems with the battery, but in my honest opinion, it's completely fine. If I can end the day with 20% or more that's more than enough to rate the battery, and I usually do. Like seriously what are you guys doing on your phones? But then again I usually charge it at night time. After using it for a year, there hasn't been a big dip in battery life. Fast charging is fast enough (I'm using the cable that came with the phone) and I haven't gotten a wireless charger. What's the best one for Pixel 7? If anyone has one please let me know.      Features  Extra dim is so handy because I honestly think this phone is too bright, even at the darkest setting, so it's always toggled when I wake up. I just wish you could schedule it like Night Light. Auto-rotate is very inconsistent in it's effectiveness even if the phone is in a 180\u00b0 angle. I feel like tilting to the left side works more than tilting to the right side. I've noticed when I turn it on it says \"face-based\". Is that the reason it's so unreliable? As I mentioned in the camera section I haven't tried it but can Photo Unblur really work on older pics? That's really cool. Battery Share is cool too but it's hard to stabilize both phones.    Versus Pixel 3  In comparison, I honestly feel the colors were more colorful on the Pixel 3? It's a bummer that there's no SD card slot but I'm basically used to it. Besides you get Google One for 3 months after you get this phone. The default storage space is enough for me anyway. **The fingerprint sensor**. Was way more convenient on the back and could be used for bringing down the notification shade. Definitely the biggest loss. Cool little details of the Pixel 3 like the colored power button, Active Edge and the two-tone design are missing on the 7. Even the box package was way more interesting with stickers and stuff.      And that's my experience with the Google Pixel 7! It's a pretty long read but I wanted to cover all my bases. I didn't talk about software because most of it isn't unique to the Pixel 7. The features section is more or less about software anyway. Overall, it's a good phone that I've enjoyed but it lost some of the cool features that made the Pixel line stand out. Onto the next year!"},"597":{"post_title":"Lamenting my Pixel 3","self_text":"Bought it in fall 2019, slapped on a screen protector and a Spigen case and it has been more or less indestructible. There have been some close calls with overheating on a car dashboard with GPS on and the temperamental charging port in the last year but overall very tolerable. I don't consume that much media when not at home anyway (I pay per GB) so even though the battery isn't as great as it was, a small external battery keeps it going even on multi-day camping trips. The camera is pretty outdated now and I envy my friends with their wide and zoom lenses but it's still very adequate and I get to brag about free Google Photos backup (though apparently I have still been storing in original quality). It stopped receiving security updates in Oct 2021 so that's probably not great. Storage is down to the last 3 of 65GB and I have to rotate apps in and out of installation. Don't have any games or much stored music since I opt to keep a massive birding guide that I rarely use instead. When it's really bright out I have a hard time seeing the screen even at maximum brightness. In spite of all that I was determined to keep using it until it bricked or I got hacked.   About 6 months ago I started getting the dreaded stuck power button issue, where trying to lock the phone with the power button would instead turn on the camera. It was tolerable though because I could lock it with an additional press of the power button. Then a month ago I put it on a wireless charger at a hotel to see if it would work and it short-circuited? Started doing the endless reboot for the first time. After that, brushing against the power button would not only activate the camera but also start dialing 911. I've somewhat remedied that by setting long press on the power button to activate Google Assistant. As of yesterday, the popular fix of smacking the phone against a table stopped working and even breathing on it too hard will send it into a reboot loop. It won't stay shut down. I've tried swabbing the power button with rubbing alcohol and using canned air. I am trying to open the back case to try and further clean the power button but I can't get the damn thing open. I'm applying heat with a hair dryer and scraping the shit out of the seam with an Exacto, have started cracking the glass and am leaving paint and metal shavings all over.

A new SoC based on the Exynos 2400 with an improved fabrication process. It may not be significantly faster, but it should be much more power-efficient.3. A new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, similar to the one in the S24 Ultra (possibly slightly improved).4. A new modem based on the Exynos 5400, likely offering better sustained high speeds and improved coverage. We're hoping it's also more energy-efficient.5. A new cooling system and internal component structure for better heat dissipation. The benefits are still uncertain, but we're optimistic.6. An upgraded camera array system with a significantly improved selfie camera and enhanced wide and ultra-wide sensors (though the main sensor remains unchanged).7.

I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that \"120Hz smoothness\" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8's UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the \"Pro\" models. In conclusion, if you were concerned with the stuttering, I am happy to report, there is no issue with it.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"650":{"post_title":"What did you noticed when you moved from pixel 8 to pixel 9?","self_text":"I currently have the P8 but looking at the P9P.

Always.Except I recently took the screen protector off of my Pixel 8. The touch wasn't as responsive, so I thought it might help. Well, it fell out of my pocket while getting out of the car... face down onto the pavement which had a few large-ish pieces of gravel which were evidently larger than the case's screen lip.And now I have two very tiny, but noticeable in certain light and by touch, scratches\/grooves on the screen. I'm upset at myself, but I'm also the timing. Just a perfect storm.Anyway, I've read that a Whitestone Dome protector can help because it uses the liquid UV glue, which would essentially fill in the tiny cracks. But... I've also seen comments with not so stellar results. Plus they're fairly expensive. Most of the other brands mentioned in the old posts seem to not be available anymore.Are there other brand options? An Amazon search for 'UV Glue Pixel 8 screen protectors' doesn't really result in many matches. I also don't want to put too much money into a screen protector because I may end up upgrading to a Pixel 9 Pro whenever there's a good deal.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

However, it has always had horrible notification issues that are now making me want to leave the phone. I had always wanted a Pixel, so I'm ready to make the switch, but need to make sure it doesn't have these issues.On the OP12, it is, for some reason, a feature to show a notification you get on your lock screen and then remove it from your lock screen if you unlock your phone at all. To explain further, if I get a text, it it will appear on my lock screen. If I then leave that text notification untouched and unlock my phone to do anything and then re-lock it, that notification will not appear on my lock screen anymore. At this point, the only way to know I have this notification still is to unlock the phone and see it at the top or to use always-on-display where the notification icons will remain.I *hate* this \"feature.\" I don't like AOD, but it forces me to use it if I want to quickly see that I have a notification. It's extremely common for me to get a notification for something, unlock my phone to do something else without looking at said notification, and then put my phone back down. With OP12, this means I can no longer easily see that I have a notification at all unless I use AOD or unlock it. This means I can't even preview a notification without fully unlocking my phone, typically. Frequently, I want to just tap my screen on, preview a text, and then lock the phone again. OP12 screws me on this constantly.To make it a bit worse, if I get several notifications, like overnight or something, I can't even see them all on the lock screen. I can scroll to see a few and then it just decides not to show the rest and I have to unlock to see everything.The other, more important, problem with OP12 is that it will just remove notifications randomly that I haven't looked at, yet. Trust me, I have every setting imaginable to prevent this from happening, yet it still does. It is not uncommon for me to get a notification and witness it disappearing as I am about to tap it to view. It's a major, major problem for me and is the main reason I don't want this phone anymore.There is also the problem of notifications being removed if you close all apps. This isn't a major issue, but is definitely annoying when I forget that doing it will just clear my notifications for no reason.Anyway, I ranted a bit there, sorry... I just want to know the P9 will retain my notifications when I get them until *I* remove them, and ideally those notifications will stay on my lock screen, too."},"726":{"post_title":" [Giveaway \/ US Only] Celebrate the Pixel 9 Launch with Spigen","self_text":"**Hey** r\/GooglePixel , we\u2019re Spigen!To celebrate the upcoming release of the Pixel 9 series, we're hosting a giveaway to show our appreciation for all the love (and feedback) this sub has given us over the years.

The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?"},"748":{"post_title":"Screen Recorder showing \"error saving screen recording\" message on Pixel 8, cannot find recording anywhere?

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like?

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"798":{"post_title":"Messages and contacts not fully transferring from S20 FE 5G to Pixel 9 Pro XL","self_text":"Just got a new phone for practically free on a trade in.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"803":{"post_title":"Verizon store warned me about Pixel issues. Should I be worried?","self_text":"I am an iPhone user that has been eying the switch to Google or Samsung ever since they committed to 7yr extended software support like Apple. I use Windows and am fed up with Apple's \"walled garden\" nonsense so I'm ready to switch.My Verizon app offered me a free Pixel 9 Pro on my existing plan with a 3yr commitment, I have no plans to leave so this seems like a no brainer. Final cost is $100 in taxes and setup fees for a $1K phone. But when I called my local Verizon store about the deal, the store manager strongly recommended that I stick with iPhone or go with Samsung if I want to switch, but they require a plan upgrade as well. He said that he's had so many customers complain or return Pixel phones for random hardware and software issues and even viruses. Most of the tech reviews I've seen for the newer Pixels seem very positive so I'm confused.In your experience as actual Pixel users, are his concerns valid? Have you had many issues with your phones?EDIT:Thank you all for your feedback. Sounds like the vast majority of you are happy with your Pixels. I decided to skip the store and just get the Pixel 9P on Verizon's website. I'm excited for the new phone!

Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"805":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I\u2019ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I\u2019ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I\u2019ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any. And remember to check your local Best Buy, if you\u2019re in a country that has one!"},"806":{"post_title":"Is the Pixel as Bad as this sub makes it seem","self_text":"Edit: jeez you guys really came out the woodwork for this.

As I browse this sub it seems like there\u2019s a lot wrong with the pixel line in general. So far I\u2019ve seen issues like battery, screen, not being able to text\/call, alarms not working.

"},"807":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing!","self_text":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices. To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone. "},"808":{"post_title":"iOS vs Android (Pixel) comparison. Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"809":{"post_title":"Official Google support rep tried to phish my account","self_text":"***See bottom update, turns out the verification prompt was legit and how Google does things.***Hey folks,I posted this on r\/Scams but I figured it was warranted to share here as well given this began through the built in support system on my pixel 9 pro.Sooooo, I went through the tips & support menu of my new pixel 9 pro and requested a callback regarding pixel 4a appeasement issues (trying to switch from pixel store credit to either the cash or battery repair of my 4a). I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"811":{"post_title":"Pickle 9 pro magsafe case review I tried a bunch of them so you don't have to!

Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"812":{"post_title":"Went from Pixel 4a to Pixel 8a. Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG). All photos shot on Lumia 950."},"813":{"post_title":"Long Post Ahead \u2013 My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User","self_text":"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos.

I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?","self_text":"Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears.

Pretty good devices except software, on the other side these devices are reliable and work well but software can be boring if used for a long time.

"},"816":{"post_title":"The things I like about Android","self_text":"Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter.

When charging, the phone has a very strong and strange \"electrical\" friction all over the metal frame, it's clearly as there's some discharge on the metal frame (no, it's not static electricity because it happens only when I charge it).2. Notifications are delayed even if I turned off \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Adaptive Connectivity\": sometimes I get them only when I wake the phone (they start to pop up the moment I wake it), sometimes they simply don't show unless I open the app for which the notifications are delayed (e.g: I open Whatsapp, I get the messages notifications), I even missed a Whatsapp call without any notification. This is a pretty serious issue (which I never had with any other phone in the past), if my Pixel 8a can't be reliable on basic phone features, I don't know if I want to keep it.3. After the Android 15 update (two days ago), Google Play Services is running in background 100% of the time (i.e.: from midnight to 8am you'll see 8 hours background usage for Google Play Services in the battery details), draining the battery. I see at least 10% drain over 6-7 hours during the night.4. A Samsung fast charger that charges rapidly all other phones instead charges my Pixel 8a very slowly (3 hour for 20-30%), I even tried another cable but inexplicably the issue persists.5. Pixel support is quite absent, I contacted them for issue #1 and then updated them with issue #4 (since it's charging related), they asked for pictures of the frame in the support chat, then for other pictures of the frame in the support email, but then nothing, now it's 5 days that I don't have any answer. Now I'll send details about issue #3, but I don't feel good about this situation.Any idea on what to do or any help would be really appreciated, factory reset is not an option (eSIM would be lost, I would lose access to banking apps which need one device always active, and so on). EDIT: \u00a0I've updated both Google Play (open the app => Settings => About => Update Play Store) and Google Play Services (manually going to its Google Play page).  I think the phone is defective due to #1, but #2 and #3 are not HW issues, so I'm thinking about buying another phone and return this (support not answering of course is a factor in this decision, 7 days of the 14 days for returning it are already gone). It's a pity because I really wanted a Pixel, I always had \"near stock Android\" phones (Nexus S, Xiaomi Mi A1, Moto G8, Moto G100) and I thought this would be a sure choice and a solid improvement, but I've read so many threads here of people complaining about #2 and #3 that I'm not sure I want to keep trying with this phone.Thanks in advance! \ud83e\udd17"},"818":{"post_title":"Your Google Store order was cancelled","self_text":"**Auto Cancellations:**  Last week, I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL with Preferred Care and a pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2, but 24 hours later, my order was automatically canceled.

They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?

I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.

Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.

Screen has been lovely and the phone has been smooth like butter, which I had given up on experiencing on any android device. Setting up was the easiest ever and I've done that many a times with custom ROMs. Apps stay loaded and ready to go making the phone feel faster (Please stop closing your apps).Finger print reader works fine 80% of the time, but I happen to have either sweaty fingers or bone dry ones.

I can use the telephoto from the roadside to take pics of cool flowers in someone's driveway without getting close. But the macro mode isn't as good but I guess not a lot of people use it. Maybe I'm spoilt because the Redmi has a dedicated macro lens which is low MP but still takes solid shots. The lens change is very visible while in photos and in videos.And finally **battery**.

However, the phone feels less rigid than the Galaxies and iPhones of the world. The glass to metal transition feels rough and not as smooth as other flagships. The volume rocker rattles, and when pushed at an angle pops up.2nd- Camera: (8.5\/10)Two years on and this camera system never ceases to amaze me. The stills I capture with this phone stack up nicely against current flagships, and beats them a lot of the time. But, and this is a big one, the videos coming out of this phone are disappointing. The sharppinning filter is through the roof, the exposure shifts are very noticeable. And the zooming transition is very choppy. 3rd- Display: (7.5 out of 10) Other than the excellent resolution, the display is mediocre. The first display I used, had a very apparent color shift to the color pink. When viewed from an angle, that is. The second screen shifts more towards blues. The compatibility with streaming apps is broken; the lowest brightness level in Netflix and amazon prime is blinding at night. The brightness under sunlight reached 1600 nits for 30 seconds and dims directly. Also it draws more power than competing flagships at the same brightness level.4th- Speakers: (5 out of 10)Lacks bass entirely. Flat. Imbalanced. Volume levels are not gradual. The only saving grace is that they don't distort at max volume.5th- Performance: (7 out of 10)For 1.5 years the phone kept on dropping frames left and right. Since March the phone feels snappy and very smooth. Gaming on the other hand is adequate. You start to notice the graphical limitations of Tensor real fast though. It also gets obscenely hot when doing anything.6th- Battery life: (6 out of 10)To put it simply, this battery is below adequate. Even for 2020 standards. It can barely reach 6 hours of SoT on wi-fi, and it really struggles to reach 4 hours on LTE\/5G. 7th- Software experience: (10 out of 10)No bloatware which is excellent.

I'm sure if I did some tinkering I could figure something out. **The Bad***Gemini, in its current state, should not be the default assistant*. This morning, I asked Gemini to play some music on Spotify, something that Google Assistant does with ease, and instead of playing music, ... it generated **python code** for calling a mysterious music API. I asked it about some good technology podcasts that I could listen to, and it decided to reach out through its YouTube Music integration to put together a special playlist for me... of random songs from YouTube Music. At the moment Gemini is the center of everything, and it reaches out to Google Assistant if it needs help. I really think that this relationship should be inverted. Google Assistant should reach out to Gemini as a last resort. Coming from iPhone though, both Gemini and Google Assistant are wiping the floor with Siri. For the time being, I've set Google Assistant to my default assistant.*Slow charging*.

Pixel Gemini won't as it says it needs to be unlocked first. Very irritating.  There is a work-around for this, which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock, but there shouldn't need to be.Add reminders hands-free using Siri - same as above.  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly.  Pixel again asks to be unlocked first.Add location-based reminders hands free using Siri - can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home.  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here.  Most of the time it just says it can't do that, but occasionally it says it has done it, but nothing happens.  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesn't announce itself but is there!  This is my biggest bugbear with Gemini.Customising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion - I love swiping for different colours, looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff.  And I LOVE the multicoloured time.Using collections of images as lock screen pictures - this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this.  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen. Why can't Pixel? (again yes I'm aware there is software for this but I haven't managed to find one that's free that works the same without ads or isn't flaky etc.)Interaction generally between calendar, reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel.  Every option I need is on there.  Location based reminders, repeating, adding locations with a link to Maps, everything.  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited. Baffling.\u2018Bouncing\u2019 animated photos - where you can get a top-shot image (eg short video) and select it to 'bounce' back and forth. This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app.  Not possible on Pixel.Copy and paste from phone to MacBook\/iPad and vice-versa.  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time.  Obviously Pixel is unable to do this.AirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music. Yes I'm a weirdo and use AM not Spotify.  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app. (Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM can't natively, so this is a bonus for Pixel)The Journal app - I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default (happy to hear people's recommendations here for one which works with iOS\/AndroidWiFi QR codes\/share WiFi password - this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform. As far as I know it isn't on Pixel.Safari reading mode - I hate adverts; I mean I really really HATE modern advertising.  So I use this feature all the time.  Pixel does not have it. But... actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google.  See my comments on my Pixel list.Removing annoying ads in Safari - another iOS18 feature. God I love this! Just delete all those shitty, irritating adverts and read in peace. Works in MacOS too.Measurements tool - I use this quite a lot in my job and it's great.  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes.  The measure tool works really well. Image crop to screen size - another small but neat feature.  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen, a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized image.Swipe down to search is much, much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel. I use this feature a lot and it's great.  In fact I use this to do almost everything.  You can search for videos, photos (by person or by subject eg 'dog', 'beach', 'York Minster' etc), music, emails, images, apps, news stories, anything.  It's brilliant.  The Pixel one is just really really limited.Keyboard- space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard, the Google one only moves left and right. This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying.  Apples solution is just better here.Note on keyboards: I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was, but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main. There is no noticeable difference for me between them.Night view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock.  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up.  Really nice feature.Calendar entries: If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries. Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries.  Siri is pretty shitty generally, but this is one area it really nails.Apple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far. I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and re-swiping every time.  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused.  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone.  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single time.Apple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together, setting reminders to work out and so on.  Just really well thought out.Screen attention (and by extension, face unlock) is much better on the iPhone; Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimes.*Now for my Pixel observations:**(Note these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14)*\u2018Now playing\u2019 on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me. Just love love love this feature.\u2018Now Playing\u2019 list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen.  So I don't even need to pay attention now, I can take a look later at what the song was.  Such a cool feature.\u2018Watch later\u2019 for YouTube suggestions, previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications.  This is brilliant and so much easier than Apples.Notifications are a bit better generally, but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification, or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three, BBC etc.Replying directly to messages from the notifications is great too.  Apple just doesn't do this.Cast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify. I don't use it but my daughter does and it's really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers. iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers, not all of them.Gemini generally better than Siri by a mile (except having to unlock phone nonsense, and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc.). It's such a shame it isn't all integrated properly, because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff.  Night and day better for asking about events, places, facts, news stories, pretty much anything. Siri's \"I've found this on the web\" is embarrassing and it's not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improves.Pixel screenshots is really handy too, just started using this and find it useful.  It's great you can create reminders from it as well, but why does it not back it all up?!  Annoying.Night Sight camera is amazing.  Four minute long exposure images, very cool.Not sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories, editing, and so on.  They are pretty closely matched for me. Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but it's very close.  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offer.Gemini live isn't there yet.  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying, I don't need my *phone* to remind me that all people are equal, or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google.  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links, show photos, play music and so on. And do it when the phone is still locked Google!Call screening - I haven't used it yet but presuming it works it's a great feature.The reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone.  Google has a free download called \"Reader mode\" and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen - this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too. It doesn't include images though, which the Apple Safari one does. This doesn't come preinstalled though.Recorder app with summary and text translation is a great feature.Split screen, although it is a bit flaky on Android 14 - Reddit always crashes using it for example.  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15? (or remove it...)Hold for me! Amazing if it works, again I haven't used it yet though.Direct my call, as aboveNotification history is a nice touch - being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one. Nice.Gemini feature 'ask about this screen' - option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it. Works quite well.Selecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news - you can block any providers you don't like completely; Apple news leaves a big sign there saying 'you have blocked this news provider - click here to unblock' which is a big 'screw you' from Apple as far as I can see.Google lens (although this is coming in iOS) is quite cool too.Magic eraser is really good for removing things from photos; works far better than I thought possible. (Again, it is coming to iOS in the coming months.  I used the beta though and it was poor)Now a couple of observations about smart watches:Apple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking, working out and listening to music.Sleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3, my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleep.Exercise stuff seems pretty similar, although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects, corrupting my data.  Very annoying.  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fine.It is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch. On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you aren't using the standard faces.Ultra is far tougher than the pixel Watch, I'm still nervous about scratching my PW3.I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2's so no comparison there yet.Well I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful. \ud83d\ude42 I'm sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features. If so, thanks.  And remember these are just my observations and opinions!"},"829":{"post_title":"Good time to switch from iPhone?","self_text":"I know this question has been asked before - but I'm going to ask it again! Do you think it's a good time to switch from an iPhone to a Pixel phone? I am currently on an iPhone 14 Pro and considering upgrading either to the iPhone 16 Pro or the Pixel 9 Pro. For context, I have used Nexus\/Pixel devices for many years, since the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7, and most recently had the Pixel 6 Pro. I also currently have a Pixel Tablet. I am fully integrated into the Google ecosystem (Keep, Photos, Calendar, Google Drive, Google Home devices, etc.)To be honest, I had a bad time with the Pixel 6 Pro. I was plagued with its infamous modem issue and I would frequently lose service and drop calls even in the middle of NYC. This was during the height of the pandemic and I missed a lot of important calls about my family being sick and COVID initiatives at the hospital where I was working. I got rid of the phone immediately as this was not tenable. I have stayed away from Pixel phones because I am afraid of repeating that situation. I\u2019ve been lukewarm on the iPhone since I\u2019ve had it, despite loving my MacBook Pro. I never loved iOS and I have always wanted to move back to Android. Most of my circles have iPhones, though, and I have to admit that iMessage is really nice to seamlessly communicate with all of them. But with RCS interoperability finally coming to the smartphone market, I think now is probably a good time as ever to move back over. What do you think?"},"830":{"post_title":"Switched from S24 Ultra 512 to 9 Pro XL 1TB - So far so good","self_text":"The last Google phone I had was the Nexus 6P at launch, [remember when phones came is cool packaging and included everything](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/McZQBtO.jpeg)? Also one that had the [full width camera bump](https:\/\/imgur.com\/cc5c3ab0-713f-4ae5-9fce-7a09c5622d7a), so is [nice to be back to form](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jBRBSRp.jpeg).Anyway had the S24 Ultra since pre-launch and as a photographer, has been my main walkaround camera as I just use the DSLR for jobs and projects now. It's been stellar for both video and photography.I'd put off buying a modern Pixel for years as there's always been something that I did not like from reviews or specs and now feel the 9 matches my requirements.But there are still things I don't like, though there's more I do so am happy to stay put. My S24 Ultra developed a battery fault so have had to send it away to Samsung under warranty and I needed a new phone before that was started. I was also running low on the 512GB storage so used the chance to go 1TB and try something new for once as have had Galaxy S and Notes since they started to hit the stores all these years.# Things I do like:* Clicking on the clock in the pulldown loads the clock app so easy access to timers, alarms etc. Samsung have not figured this out all these years...* [The first transfer from S24U to XL was seamless](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BKP2h3Q.jpeg), 85% of all my apps carried over logons\/settings. A nice surprise as was expecting some headaches.* The camera offers some more granular control over what Samsung offers outside of Pro Mode.* Camera HDR processing is better than Samsung's.* Lens selection is remembered as you switch modes, Samsung forgets the modes regularly.* 4K 60fps recording is about on par with Samsung but Google's EIS is garbage still, Samsung's isn't great but it's less jittery. Turning EIS on both and using OIS alone provides better quality video recordings.* [Camera lenses all capture less glare](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ghX3iPb.jpeg) (S24 Ultra on right)  from off-screen light sources like a screen in low light than on Samsung. XL also captures and resolves better highlight detail under [colourcast low lighting conditions](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E3vy9Q4.jpeg).* The baseline fluidity of Pixel OS is a nicer experience than One UI 6.1.1 (not tried One UI 7 yet but I suspect it will be on par if not better next month).* Battery charging and drain metrics are much better on pixel than on Samsung. more useful information.* Finally proper Bluetooth CODECs supported, no longer just have LDAC and no aptX HD etc.* The Pro XL feels nicer in the hand than the S24 Ultra. The rounded corners, the edge frame and general feel is just more hand friendly.* The haptic motor is of a higher quality than what Samsung have, I think it's just a small step below iPhone haptics or very similar.* Screen brightness at max feels brighter than the S24 Ultra, though the adaptive brightness has a mind of its own and doesn't remember my manual adjustment. maybe it has not had enough time to learn the brightness I prefer on the slighter in each lighting situation though as One UI learns this over time.* The speakers are fine, though I think the Atmos Mobile level output of the S24 Ultra is just better overall.# Things I don't like:* The stock Pixel home launcher, it's fine but like all OEM launchers, is pretty basic and offers nothing spectacular. [So I restored my Nova Launcher layout ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/btX4V7q.jpeg)and tweaked some gestures and sizing to suit the narrower screen res of the XL.  [Also organised the app drawer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ln4QIAe.jpeg), people moan that Samsung's bundled apps are too much, yet my \"Google\" folder is [even bigger](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uMow8RY.png) than the one on my S24 Ultra.* The thermometer is absolutely garbage. It doesn't work half the time, what is even the point of this? What a waste of resources and R&D.* AOD and lockscreen functionality is lacking compared to Samsung One UI. Not a huge issue but it feels basic by comparison.* No Google alternative to Good Lock subsystem for customisation and enhancing base-features.* Fast wireless charging seems to be limited to 23W only when using the Pixel Stand (2nd gen), else it draws only 12W using regular wireless fast chargers, even 15W-20W ones? Am I missing something because Google no longer sell the Pixel Stand, and it's also butt ugly and bulky....* Wired charging is 33W only, not a huge issue for me as I wireless charge at all times via top up anyway but even slow-as-balls Samsung offer 45W charging.* No Google alternative to Samsung Modes & Routines. I have a routine on my S24 to turn on wifi hotspot when I get in my car and Bluetooth connects to the stereo so I can play Spotify\/YouTube etc on the head unit. Now I have to turn it on manually...* Night mode video requires uploading the video to google cloud for processing. Why can't this be done on-device?* Can't seem to see where my option is for enabling VoLTE, I'm on EE and the option on the S24 is in network settings. Nowhere to be found on Pixel. Notification bar just says 5G with no mention of HD+ or VoLTE. call history screen also just shows wifi calling icon for the calls I made when on wifi and no icon when on mobile data indicating no VoLTE was being used as was expecting to see HD+\/HD in these call lists.* [The packaging feels like the same quality as the pack of 6 eggs](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NEcXCuE.jpeg) I have in the kitchen. cop-out much for a \u00a31400 phone, Google???* Why is the power button ABOVE the volume button?!That is a big list of things I don't like, but I can work around all of them basically and adapting to change is important in life. I like enough about it that I'm fine with doing this. Hopefully this means I stick around with a pixel for an equal amount of time as I did Galaxy.UPDATE:It's now been a month since I posted this and safe to say I probably won't be going back to Samsung. The battery is just better outright, I can use the camera as often as I like and it doesn't drain as fast as it does on the S24 Ultra, the missing features have been forgotten and I'm just doing a couple more steps to get to apps I'd have edge gestures for before which is fine now, the screen is a little nicer to look at and brighter in sunlight, the charging speeds have not been an issue at all and this seems more efficient when using things like satnav or hotspot to may car's Android stereo using the 5GHz band.Above all else, the camera has been the biggest gain, the quick shot ability even in low light is just excellent and the RAW dng versions are tonally better to work with too with less noise in low light."},"831":{"post_title":"Phone issue - call straight to VM and texts coming in clumps","self_text":"I am a Verizon customer and there doesn't seem to be outages or other issues in our area, but my phone and my wife's phone (both Pixel 7 Pro) have been sending calls straight to voicemail and not pushing texts through except for in clumps throughout the day. All the sudden I will receive a notification for four voicemails all indicating that my phone didn't ring, and text responses for 10+ individuals\/groups from a previous two to three hours period in which I received no texts. This has happened consistently for the past 7-10 days. I have word of mouth experiences from other Verizon customers that they aren't having issues (iPhone and Galaxy users) who get a similar call\/text load to me through our job (also same geographical area, which is Twin Cities metro, Minnesota). It could be an android issue or a specifically bad iPhone to android issue, but it appears to only be happening to our phones. Verizon and Google customer service were no help, but I feel like it has to be some kind of issue with a recent update based on the nature of the problem and my past history. I have noticed regular issues with this phone where periods of high group-text or individual text frequency result in a delay to messaging for a handful of minutes in the past (maybe 15-20 at the max with a click of the \"fix connectivity\" option correcting immediately, but that is specifically a messaging issue where this seems to be a problem with any phone to phone mobile network and WiFi communication. I have power cycled several times, tried different areas of my house (and different geographical locations), tried the \"fix connectivity\" button, and reported to both Verizon and Google.

From what I've seen the cases all put the ring with the google logo in the middle.  However to be aligned it should actually be lower.  I'm going to try a few other cases and maybe try a sticker of my own to see if I can resolve\\[END UPDATE\\]    Buyer beware the pixel 9 pro does not appear to be compatible with the Pixel Stand 2 despite advertising saying it should charge at 21W.  I know it was announced this was true for the fold but not for other Pixel 9s.Behavior:When you set the phone on the charger it starts charging at 400-600 mAmps.  You can verify this using the app named \"ampere\".  As it sits it starts climbing up until the Pixel Stand 2 blinks amber quickly.  At that point the charging disconnects goes negative for a few seconds until it reconnects and starts at 400 mAmps again.  I've tried with and without a case and neither of them helps.  I'm using the Pixel Stand 2 with the charging block and cable that were shipped with the stand.   My wifes generic branded wireless charging works just fine at about 800-900 mAmps.

Firstly, is there a bug with notifications? For some reason my notifications from messaging apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram and Messenger are either delayed or they don't ring at all. I'd looked up various solutions online and shut down the adaptive battery functions, double checked the apps notification but they still fail to notify me. I have another spare phone from Poco that gets my notifications almost immediately, and the performance of the Pixel is just embarrassing. What is going on with that? Are there any other solutions about it? Secondly, when I'm using WIFI to make video calls or play online games, there always seems to be an issue about connectivity and I'll lag seriously here and there, and my solution is just to switch off WIFI and just proceed with that. It usually solves the problem, but again why is it that other devices wouldn't have this problem? Let's not even go there about the Tensor chip because the performance is quite disappointing in gaming but thankfully I'm only a casual one and don't play demanding games.Thirdly, with the Reddit app, there seems to be a bug where when I'm scrolled all the way to the top on a subreddit, I'm unable to click on the toolbar that's in the frame with the subreddit header above to search and I have to go back to the main page and search from there. Does anyone else have this issue?Dang it. The photos of that the Pixel 9 take are awesome, and for the most part it's sufficient for my daily use, but these little things annoy me. There are so many reviewers that rate the Pixel 9 Pro as the best phone of 2024, and I'm wondering if the gap between the two phones are that huge? I don't need the bells and whistles, not the extra lens. But there shouldn't be such a big gap performance-wise right? Seriously considering the Chinese foldable phones on the market..."},"834":{"post_title":"Pixel 8 is absolutely garbage - VENT","self_text":"Hi all,Long time android user here. I have been through several Android smartphones, from Samsung Galaxy S2 to OnePlus7. I have been through them all. Although I wasn't very happy with all Android smartphones, I personally feel my OnePlus7 purchase was the best.The reason why I love Android because I hate ads and on Android I can root my smartphone and block ads at a DNS level. That's the only reason I never moved to an iPhone.I love stock Android and prefer to install lineage but as with all third party ROMs, some functionality or the other gets broken. Hence, this time I decided to buy a Pixel as it would come with a stock ROM and the only thing I would need to do is root my smartphone and install an ad blocking apk thereby creating the perfect device.I bought the Pixel 8 on September 2023 and I truly regret my purchase. It is an absolute piece of garbage and the entire Pixel team in Google should honestly be sorry for creating such a piece of garbage. The below are my issues with Pixel 8.1. Heating - This phone heats like crazy when I use it on 5G. One of the reasons I upgraded to Pixel 8 from OnePlus 7 was because OnePlus 7 did not support 5G. However, after seeing the heating issue on 5G, I was forced to keep my device on LTE which negated the whole purpose of buying this device. I suspect some of this heating has to do with Google's tensor chip which is very subpar compared to Apple's in house SoC and even Qualcomm's SoC. I don't know they developed tensor? Just because Apple has their own SoC, I guess?2. Lag and bugs - Several popular apps such as Swiggy (food delivery app in India) and other apps lag like crazy on this device. This issue has been confirmed by others as well. There is a random bug on instagram which causes brightness to increase to max for certain reels which is very weird to say the least.3. Build and screen size - Screen size is smaller and build is heftier than usual. I hate holding this device. At a time when other manufacturers have moved towards less bezel and more display, Google has gone the opposite way.4. App switcher button not working - This is the craziest bug of them all. The app switch button simply doesn't work. I have realized that this has been a recurrent issue with Pixel phones and something Google simply refuses to address? I mean what kind of snobby head in their a\\*\\*\\* kind of engineers does Google have that they simply do not address such a simple bug for years together? Even low quality Chinese OEMs do a better job at fixing simple bugs like these on their device and here we have the \"flagship\" Google phone for which there is no fix. I pay iPhone equivalent price for such a piece of shit.5. Useless AI gimmicks - Instead of nailing down the basics of what makes a good phone, Google has decided to stuff it with useless AI gimmicks which 99% of people are never going to use. I have personally not used a single one of them.WORST OF IT ALL COMES BELOW.5. After sales service - There is literally negligible after sales service for Pixel, at least in India. I started seeing a pink line on my display and gave it to the service center which is authorized by Google. Anyone wants to guess the TAT? 15 DAYS !!! Yes, not 15 hours, 15 DAYS. There is no replacement device provided and the service center is a third party center which doesn't even pick my calls on most days and all Google reviews for Pixel for this service center is 1 star. For my OnePlus7, the battery had worn off and they replaced the same within 2 hours. Just 2 hours. That's it.Conclusion - I made a blunder spending $700 on Pixel 8 over here in India. It is half my monthly salary. I don't even know if I will ever get my phone back from the service center, even if I do, I don't want to use it for more than a year before I switch to iPhone for good. I will watch some ads but at least I will have a much better phone to use.  Edit - The downvotes are crazy, it is because of die hard fanboys like you that Google and its Pixel team gets away with such a shitty phone. If this were a third party OEM who built such a phone at such a price, they would be bankrupt by now. Anyhow, keep funding the snobs at Google. I personally, am done."},"835":{"post_title":"3 Months After switching from IPhone","self_text":"Decided to make the switch to Pixel from IPhone 13PM back in August. I did a one week review to give my initial perspective on the switch and I was not too convinced of the switch back then.\u00a0 It has been 3 months since the Google Pixel P9XL was launched and I was fortunate enough to receive mine on launch day and it has been a great experience learning the different features Pixel offers. I love all this new technology but will admit that my view points are based solely on what I see and experience just like the average person. I will try to be as unbiased as possible but will also highlight things that I enjoyed the most. As I said in my initial review, I was not too convinced about switching over but after 3 months I would say that I will be on Pixel for a while.\u00a0BUILD* \u00a0I mentioned this the first time during my initial review of the Pixel P9XL but will mention it again. I was always interested in the Google Pixel but they always looked very poorly made. When I would go see them at my local Best Buy they felt very flimsy as well. The Pixel P9XL at first glance looked like the previous model but the camera housing had changed just a bit. It went from being a bar across the top back to being an oval shaped housing. I personally felt that this made the phone look better because it made that chrome coloring of the housing much more bearable. I am not much of a fan of chrome on things, just looks tacky lol but then again that is just my preference. With that aside, the Pixel P9XL is much lighter than my previous, the IPhone 13PM. I noticed it right away as soon as I took it out of the box. The phone was very light but felt durable and looked premium. 3 months later I still do enjoy the pixel and like the premium look it gives off. I chose the Hazel Pro XL model but I will admit I believe that the Pixel looks best in their Peony color. But that is also just a preference. One other I will point out is that I always had a worry that the camera housing would get damaged due to sticking out. After usage for this long I have not gotten a scratch on the camera house. Sadly I did drop it once in the first week and it has an internal scratch that was caused by what I believe is the camera lens inside. So far I don't believe it has affected picture or video quality. I have kept my Pixel P9XL in a Spigen Ultra Hybrid case along with an Amazon choice screen glass protector. The P9XL has a feature for when you equip a screen protector that allows it to read your fingerprint and all gestures normally. The feature is available but even with the screen protector on I have not really had a need for it. Overall the design of the phone looks and feels premium and as many had pointed out it gives a similar feel to the IPhone models. I wouldn\u2019t say that is a bad thing.SCREEN\t* The screen for the Pixel P9XL is pretty good. When out in direct sunlight the screen gets bright enough to not have any difficulty seeing what I am doing. I have adaptive brightness and spend most of my day indoors so I never really do have to set my screen to a high level of brightness. The screen sensitivity settings can be altered whenever you put on a screen protector as previously stated but you most likely won't need too. I opted to get the XL version so I am really enjoying the 6.8 in screen and the small punch hole front camera I feel does not interfere with everyday use or when watching videos. Colors are great when watching videos or playing games as well.\u00a0BATTERY LIFE* I have read various posts on here from new pixel users that their battery life just isn't great. I was in the same boat in the beginning but after a couple of weeks of letting my Pixel adapt to my usage, my battery life significantly improved. I will be using my day to day as a base for how long my battery lasts, everybody's usage varies but this example is more to get an idea of how good the battery life on the Pixel P9XL is. As I said it has been around 3 months with the Pixel P9XL. I leave it at full charge before going to bed, my first alarm rings at 4:30 am so that I can get up and get ready to go to the gym. I usually spend an hour to an 1.5 at the gym which I only use for playing music on Spotify. By the time I start my work day at 8 am my Pixel is usually at 88-92% of battery. I will do some pretty heavy scroll thru my phone throughout the day. I call my wife, check my socials and email. By the time my workday is done at 530 pm, I am running at 35-40% but it is usually more on the lower end. I usually don\u2019t get back to constantly use it until I am about to head into bed just to check any last minute emails and whatnot. At that time it is 1030 pm when I am setting my phone to charge. So I would say battery life is pretty good. Just takes a couple of weeks to recognize your usage.CAMERA* I have been using my camera non stop and have been loving the pictures that come out. I have only been using stock settings to take photos. I have always enjoyed being able to just point and shoot and be able to produce a good quality picture. I will switch to night mode or how google calls it night sight, it comes in handy in low light settings. I will have to say when compared to my wife\u2019s 15 Pro, her night pictures do come out a bit better. But Pixel P9XL still produces a great shot and the features in the google studio allow you to edit pictures to your liking. Google studio has really come in handy for me when taking pictures of my newborn, allowing me to hold her up with my hand and then just erase my hand out of the pictures. One thing I will point out, when zooming in and out there is a small lag in between which isn\u2019t too bothersome.. If you don't pay attention to it haha. I have taken a couple of videos and enjoy the quality. Videos look super smooth and crisp, sadly the zooming lag also affects videos and is very noticeable when zooming in and out during videos. Not a deal breaker but can be bothersome at times.\u00a0Software* I am not much of a software guy but will say that the pixel IU is more suited for people that want to personalize their phone to their liking. Gives the phone a much more personal feeling. I have also seen on many subreddits various third party apps that you can get to customize your app shapes and colors. Although I plan to keep my Pixel stock, I like that the option to customize my Pixel even further is there. One thing that I do not like and continue to experience is apps taking forever to load up or sometimes they just crash. Nothing major but kind of weird.\u00a0Overall, I am enjoying my Pixel P9XL. After ten years of being on Apple, Pixel has been something more refreshing. There is a lot more to the Pixel P9XL that I definitely didn\u2019t cover but like I said this is just a simple review of my 3 months after switching from IPhone. At first I would miss things such as IMessage and Facetime but over time I just stopped even thinking about it. If you\u2019re thinking of switching over from IPhone I would say give it a try \ud83d\ude42EDIT: Someone did mention what I forgot to mention which is the notification delays. I've had it happen a couple times but it isn't as persistent or nagging to me as it has been to other from what I've read on here. I just didn't mention it bc it was something that rarely occured to me but it is worth mentioning as everyone else is having different experiences "},"836":{"post_title":"Disappointed with Pixel","self_text":"I was a huge Google fan, from the Nexus line to the pixel line, I've had several pixels and I'm officially fed up.

I have a work iPhone 14 that's much smaller mind you and it not only out performs, it out last it in battery by multiple miles. No feature is with this nonsense. In between pixel I've had other phones as well, Samsung, Apple, LG, even Motorola and none of them have been this bad at all. It's a shame because I really like the Google features but that's starting to not matter since Samsung seems to be getting all of them.

The quick settings in general are so horrible to use in imo coming from an iphone 13 and a lenovo tablet.  On both my android lenovo and my iphone it worked the same, drag down from top right corner for quick settings, drag from top left for notifications.  Simple, fast, easy.On the pixel though there is no top right or top left drawer... just the top, and not only do you have to drag down twice to change brightness, the crazy thing is you have to swipe UP TWICE to put it away too.  Such terrible design... I don't need to see my notifications on the way up and on the way down every time I want to change my brightness  (which is a lot).I found a free app called \"bottom quick settings\" which kinda addresses the issue but it's very buggy.  I didn't realize android came in so many different flavors, when I use my moms samsung or my housemates xiaomi it's also the same thing, drag down once to change your brightness.TL;DR, the pixel UI quick settings is terrible please help me fix it.  I will flash a custom os or even trade my 8a in for a different phone if that's the only solution it bugs me that much.  Edit: I should clarify, I know about the two finger method and I think it's terrible, since it's impossible to do with one hand.  Google should really just make an option that lets you choose between 2 fingers, or having separate corners for notifications or quick settings just like iphone and other android UIs have."},"838":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro review 1 month in ","self_text":"So I had the Nexus 4, the 5x, the Pixel2 and the Pixel 4. I've been using my Pixel 4 since it launched until now. I was reluctant to change because 1. the new Pixels don't have IR based face unlock 2. the early Tensor chips seemed a backwards step from the Snapdragon 8 series in the 4 3. The camera band stuck out too much for me. I briefly owned a Pixel 7 that I had to return: too many dropped calls and the bad fingerprint sensor was driving me slowly insane, and blind at bed time.That Pixel 4 started acting up though and the lack of updates did not help it. So Black Friday, got the 150 dollars off deal at Best Buy and decided to splurge for the 9 Pro since it did not have the wrap around camera bump and it looked better than the 7\/8 and the fingerprint sensor was upgraded to an ultrasonic one.in my 1 month of usage: wow, battery life is great, the fingerprint sensor has not failed to unlock even once, and the display is so bright and smooth.I had only one issue and it seemed to have been resolved with the latest update: Every once in a while,  an app would try to use face unlock and it is too dark so it says use fingerprint instead. When touching the fingerprint sensor, nothing happens. You have to exit the app and start over.

I had the Pixel 2, (loved it), then the Pixel 6, (loved it), and then last February, I traded it in for the Pixel 8 for free. Here's where things start to become extremely irritating and frustrating. I loved my Pixel 6. Only reason I traded it in for the Pixel 8 was because A.) If I traded it in, I got the Pixel 8 for free. And B.) The battery was absolutely shot in it and would barely hold a 4-5 hour charge. So, got it last February some time. At first, it was fine. I didn't notice really anything different upgrading from the 6 to the 8, besides the better battery life of course. Fast forward, as the months go on, I begin to notice some severe performance issues in the phone. It was overheating CONSTANTLY. Even when I was barely using the phone. My girlfriend and I are long distance, and we talk mostly via text and Snapchat. So often, we will have 2 conversations going on at once. For some reason, this would overheat my phone tremendously. It would overheat it to the point that Snapchat would stop sending me notifications for Snapchat. Half the time, I would never get a notification that she messaged me back. The other half of the time, I'd get a notification, but only after exactly 10 minutes of her sending it. This became exceedingly frustrating for the both of us. Also, with text messages, a lot of the time it would just spin and spin and spin and then say \"! Message not sent.\" So I would have to resend it. However, it's not even like the phone would tell me it didn't send. It just... Wouldn't. Only until my girlfriend would ask me on Snapchat why I didn't text her back would I notice the message failed to send. However, despite these issues, (and other laggy issues), I kept using the phone because of the \"free phone fine print\" I should've read better through my carrier. Low and behold, the phone is free, (with Verizon paying the balance of the phone), OVER the course of 3 years. If I upgrade the phone, I have to pay the remaining balance. So, I just figured I'd suffer with it, since by this point I was used to its constant issues. Now, let's jump to last month. I go to bed, everything is fine. I wake up, and my Pixel 8 isn't working with anything Google related. No, I'm not kidding. I could not access my Gmail, my text messages, my notes, my photos, Chrome, ANYTHING Google related. But I could still access Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok, etc just fine. It's like the whole \"Google\" part of the Google phone just... died? No phone calls either. So, I went to Verizon, and, (shout out to the Verizon rep), he finagled me a deal. Apparently last month, Verizon was offering free Pixel 9s with a new line. Long story short, the dude gave me a new line, but transferred my phone number to the new phone, and the new phone number is just a \"ghost line.\" This way, Verizon is still paying off the Pixel 8, and, now they are paying off the Pixel 9 in the same way. But now here we are, about a month since I've had this new phone... And low and behold, I'm starting to see the same exact issues happen that I did with my Pixel 8. I can't switch between apps without them restarting completely. For example, if I'm watching a TikTok, then go to text my girlfriend, when I re-open TikTok, the whole app just restarts and I lose the video I was on. Earlier, I was taking photos for things to sell on eBay while watching a YouTube video, and after 3-4 pictures, YouTube crashes and stops the video. When I open Snapchat or my texts, the whole phone freezes. It's starting to lag. Today it's been overheating like crazy. When I open Snapchat and click to type my message, the keyboard won't even pop up. I have to restart the app 2-3 times to get it to work.The last phone, my GB were pretty maxed out. With this phone, that's not the case at all. I've kept this phone a lot more clean in terms of storage, but yet I'm again experiencing the same issues I was on the Pixel 8. So my question is, what is WRONG with these phones? Is it just me? Is it something I'm doing? Some type of setting? It's just extremely frustrating. Right now, I can't even text my girlfriend because my text messages are stuck on the watch symbol and for the life of me will not send. I loved my Pixel 2 and my Pixel 6. They were the best phones I had ever had. However, my experience with the 8 and 9 so far have been nothing short of awful, and I'm actually considering switching to Samsung. The guy at Verizon told me he hasn't heard anyone complain about the Pixel 9. But I'm just experiencing the same exact issues I was before. I couldn't even transfer anything from my Pixel 8 because everything Google UI related completely died. I'm scared the same thing is going to happen with this phone too. Any advice?

I immediately contacted Google to ask for an explanation. Neither by email nor by chat I got a reply. \"We are investigating what happened\". They are just saying me this everyday.

Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum.2. Apps are always killed in the background, any app. Can't keep anything running in the background (very annoying while gaming - I'm playing PUBG).

No way to turn off the screen other than the power button (double tap on home screen for example)9. Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10.

Similar, reaching out to Google is like pulling hair. I've managed to get one \"supervisor\" to admit the issue was present and that they're \"working hard to fix it\", but Google's go-to is always warranty swap.We have 3 Pixel 8s in the house, and it was sometime earlier this year that we identified many calls were not coming through to our handsets. Our son would send us a message on Facebook saying \"tried to call, just silence then voicemail\". We'd go to call him back and our phones would just hang. We would have to toggle airplane mode on and off, then be able to make\/receive calls.To be fair, we do live on the fringe of cell service, but this was never (and still isn't) an issue with the kids in our house with iPhones.I set up some testing using an automated platform, dispatching an automated call at the top of every hour to the 3 Pixel 8s in our house. About 1\/3 of the tests failed, with the calls either hanging (silence) or directly to voicemail - in some cases, it was 10-20 seconds of silence, then voicemail. In some cases, the incoming call would not ring, but be marked as a missed call, then the actual call would come in behind it seconds later.When the calls did reach the handset, incoming calls made the phone go from 5G to LTE then 3G, and back to 5G. We forced the phones into LTE, then tried this test again, but still, they downgraded to 3G.I also did similar with SMS, but they were all delivered either instantly or within 30 seconds.I'm not going to fully rule out the network here, but the iPhones in the house can handle the exact same cell network with no issues. I suspect we are a small percentage, but still a percentage.The real kicker was following the two April updates, the Pixels were suddenly dropping the WiFi connection, too. I'd get an email and notice my phone didn't go off, only to see the WiFi icon was gone, cellular was dormant, and my saved home WiFi network was disabled due to bad connectivity. Again, airplane toggle on and off fixed both. iPhones maintained their connection. For these reasons, we can't use WiFi calling, either.So, these modems clearly can't handle fringe\/edge cellular connections. Google has admitted this is a problem. A quick search on Reddit, which Google support refuses to acknowledge, shows I am not alone.What now, Google? Do we just wait? Do I keep this Pixel support going until it really burns me, like a 911 call that doesn't go through, or a call from the school that our son is violently ill and needs to come home?Where do we draw the line?

This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13\" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it \"exciting\"? Not really.

Man I hate Google so much!!!","self_text":"So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go \"Is that child porn?\" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here \"A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious.\"\u00a0[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said \"Why should other people have more privacy than I do?\" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer \"only store passwords locally on device\" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While\u00a0not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable \"Advanced Data Protection\" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself;\u00a0this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account.\u00a0So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!!

For reference, I've used s24 ultra, s24+ and OnePlus 12, 12R and pixel 8 and 8 pro this year.Design: Looks really nice. Feels great in the hand. I got no complaints.Camera: Better than the s24 and it's not close. Every picture you take is bright and quite nice. The colors come out punchy and make the picture look good.Software: Amazing. The best out there in my opinion. The animations are quite nice too. I do enjoy the translation feature, call screen, hold for me, and now playing. Also, pixels have the best transcript feature in any phone. Unrelated, but the haptics are great also.Performance: Unfortunately, once again, performance isn't great. In normal conditions, performance is fine. You can tell it isn't as fast as snapdragon 8 gen 3 phones, but it's smooth enough that you don't care. However, I was in the sun earlier today and the phone barely even heated up, but the performance took a nose dive. Tensor G4 is, as expected, not much better than all the tensors before it. This is a midrange chip and shouldn't be in a phone which the base model costs $799.I was enjoying the phone until all these performance issues.Sadly, another year and another pixel ruined by tensor.Battery: It's decent enough. It will last the whole day without charging. Nothing amazing but good enough. However, charging is extremely slow. 1-100 takes at least 1 hour and 30 mins. And if you use the phone at all while it's charging, it won't be done for 2 hours. That's simply not acceptable in 2024.It is worth noting that the s24 has 25w charging too but it is noticeably faster than the pixel 9.Overall, aside from the charging speeds and the performance, the pixel 9 is a nice phone. I enjoyed using it due to the software. But once again, this wasn't enough for me to keep using it. The performance issues are too much of a deal breaker. I was truly hopeful this year.Here is to hoping the pixel 10 gets a real flagship processor so that I can enjoy using pixels again. My favorite user experience is ruined by a mediocre hardware once again."},"849":{"post_title":"Heartbroken having to return my Pixel 8 because of call dropping.","self_text":"Never thought I would be in this boat, even hearing and reading so much about it, really didn't think it would happen to me, but unfortunately, after 4 months of owning my favorite phone I've had so far, my P8 decided to start dropping calls a few days ago. All of a sudden I couldn't receive or make any calls. The first second would appear to go through, and then get dropped stating to turn off airplane mode to make a call. Every time.I think I tried mostly everything I came across online. Messed with a bunch of settings and toggles, off and on, then noticed the March software update, installed it (which didn't help), reset network settings, rebooted in safe mode, until finally I did what I didn't want to do and ended up factory resetting the phone, which I really thought would fix the issue. But even after the reset - not a single call would go through. I was honestly quite shocked, and really disappointed because I really loved the phone.Despite loving nearly everything about the Pixel and being totally fine with its shortcomings, call issues is not something I could live with.Really wish Google would take these issues more seriously, but by now I've come to terms with the Pixel being more of a side project for them and  them honestly just not caring."},"850":{"post_title":"I actually like my Pixel 8 Pro","self_text":"Had my phone now for two months. I consider myself a power user and a shutter bug, so I need a phone with welly and a decent camera. I do a lot of tinkering with Tasker and Termux and have these burning away in the background.I came from the Pixel 3a, to Pixel 5 and now the Pixel 8 Pro. I also rock a Samsung S20 5G, which coupled the weak CPU in the Pixel 5. I now have a single device to tinker on.Camera is almost flawless. I mean, no camera is perfect, but so far it's definitely the best camera on a phone I've had my hands on (admittedly, I avoid Apple). Photos and videos are of outstanding, professional quality and that's before editing it.Battery is flipping awesome. From the overuse of my P5 and S20, their batteries are not holding up as much, so charging became commonplace. I still use the S20 for some things and each time I go to put it on charge, the Pixel 8P still has over 70% left (after 12 or more hours). Have played CoD and Metalstorm a lot (at high res and 60fps), even over 5G and the battery still holds it's own. Device does get warm, I'd be rather worried if it didn't with what it was doing!UI\/UX. Well, it's classic Android as always. Under the hood Google have added some cool AI features and gestures. Double tap to back takes some fiddling over the P5, but I am wearing a shock case on the P8P. I had to turn off the animations, mind (Developer Menu or via Accessibility). They were too smooth\/slow for my liking, I prefer a snappy UI. I have switched to using Nova (8.x) as my launcher and use 3 button navigation (am an old timer, so shhh! \ud83d\ude02).Biometrics. Well, I don't know what it wrong with everyone else, but I even have a hardened glass on my P8P and have had an easy 98\/100 success rate. I do prefer either back or side mounted, but the under screen does come in useful when you can't pick up phone. Fortunately, the S20 has screen fingerprint, so had time to get used to one. Oh and it has face unlock, which seems to know when you're using a photo instead of a person. This creeped me out with one of my banking apps. Opened it, looked away as it loaded, looked back to see my balances \ud83d\ude16. If you have a Pixel watch, you can even unlock your phone from watch.Network. I use two SIMs (eSIM+SIM) on this. One is very 5G available and the other is mostly used for calls and texts, as well as backup data. The phone is mostly on cell, 5G being very common. The other network does have 5G, but only in some areas (EE UK and Vodafone UK). I did this with my Pixel 5 as well as my S20 (have at least two different networks, giving me access to all 4 MNO's in the UK (Three, O2, EE, Vodafone)). Despite what I've read of others, I don't experience overheating or excessive battery drain. I will admit, the phone did not like one of my WiFi 5 WPA3 only access points. Just outright refuses to connect to it. Every other AP and it's fine. Speed of both 4G\/5G and WiFi 5 are as expected. Haven't tested a 6\/6e AP, yet.Power user friendliness. It's a frigging beast! I've thrown all kinds of shenanigans at it. Compiled a few wheels in Termux for python, as well as some ham radio tools and onboard AI and it storms through. Tasker is doing a variety of things based on conditions and events, including reactions to the logcat. With 9 cores and 12GB RAM, it has welly to go wading all day long. Neither have been terminated in background and phantom processes aren't killed. I used my S20 for most of this, as it has 12GB RAM, too. Now it's all being offloaded to the Pixel as it's just outright faster. Still waiting to test out UWB, too.Questions? Please do ask.

I have a starred contact named Work, lets say the number is +1 (234)567-8900.This morning, after my phone was on the normal Sleep do not disturb schedule, I wake up and see a notification that says \"Missed Call - Work\", from 4:26am. It had never rang. I even confirmed with my surveillance camera recording, no sounds were playing at that time, but the phone screen was showing \"Incoming call from +1 (234)567-8900\".  My notification history also says \"Incoming call from +1 (234)567-8900\" at 4:26am. But there was no \"Incoming call from Work\" popup, just the raw number, which is why I think it didn't get through DND as a starred contact.However, the \"Missed Call - Work\" notification that was remaining when I woke up was NOT worded as \"Missed Call - On Do Not Disturb\" which shows up when a random number calls me and the phone correctly stays silent. So it seems like the missed call notification correctly identified the contact, but not while it was actively ringing.I have successfully had this contact call me through Do Not Disturb in the past with no problem, several times per month. So it can't be a problem on my end. What would cause it to randomly fail just this once? And how do I fix it to never happen again?It's very, VERY bad to miss this call. So much so that I've had to order an iPhone and will be throwing my android away if it's not resolved by the time the iPhone gets here.[Here is a screenshot](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3sID25f.png) of my notification history where you see the \"Incoming call\" as just a number, but the \"Missed call\" shows the correct contact.

The Pixel 8a is an amazing phone.I used the Galaxy A33 for just over a year and I needed a change. I don't really like iOS and I'm tired of Galaxy phones. I wanted a smooth, stock Android experience and two brands came in mind: Nothing and Google. However as a person who prefers smaller phones, I leaned towards the Pixel for its smaller form factor. To be honest I was quite worried about VoLTE support in my country because it is not released here in Korea. Also I saw many posts on this subreddit saying that the modem and processor in Pixels in general have terrible power efficiency. I bought it for \u20a9580000 incl. Tax ($429) and I have to say it was an awesome choice. The display is super bright, stock Android experience is awesome. Design is nice too, I got the Bay color and I love the amount of saturation. Performance was decent; of course raw performance won't be Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 grade, but the optimization and 120Hz display make it feel super fast and snappy. Cameras produced great photos with realistic colors. Battery was for me not amazing on screen on but lasted for a long time in standby, but it's only been a day since I started using it so I'll keep an eye on it. I was too lazy to patch the VoLTE but 3G calling works just fine. I don't call often anyway.Also, the attention to detail in stock Android is unmatched. The animations, for example when waking the phone with the power button differs from waking with a tap.

I, for one, learned the hard way and this is my experience... These devices are riddled with bugs, glitches, manufacturer flaws and a slew of other downright annoying \"features.\" Google Customer Support is all but useless. If you have anything currently in \"escalation,\" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen\/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their \"certified repair partner\" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a \"certified\" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a \"Manager,\" \"Supervisor,\" or member of the \"Escalation Team\" in 24-48 hours? Rest assured, you will NOT be contacted. And if by some miracle you are contacted, the person likely won't speak in your native tongue, AND will likely have more questions than answers! I was in awe: \"Excuse me? You called me back a month later as a member of the Escalation Team and YOU are asking ME what seems to be the problem?!?\" Honestly, it's like you're talking to the first line of defense all over again...Only to be forwarded and transferred all over the place to be asked the same questions a dozen more times. As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the \"extended warranties\" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly. But a simple Google search (I know, Google, right?!?) will flood you with warranty info, defect issues and a plethora of horror stories similar to mine. Do not get lost in the shiney new toy. Stick with what you know.It really should have never gotten to this point, as any reputable company would have just fixed the phone or, hell, even replaced the damn thing! And for those of you with screen defects, it doesn't simply get better with a \"repair.\" A coworker of mine had their Pixel screen replaced THREE times only to have the problem persist within weeks if not days. Replacing a faulty display with a faulty display doesn't help too much.

After contacting Google support multiple times and following their advice to check with neighbors and wait, I was told to have DHL conduct an investigation. Google insisted that the package was delivered, despite my claims that it was not. I emphasized my rights under EU consumer law and requested a replacement or refund. Google continued to redirect me to DHL, maintaining that they bore no responsibility. After numerous emails and calls, I feel frustrated & believe I was robbed of 399 euros without receiving the product.Update: After chatting with DHL, I confirmed that the shipment is still under investigation & that no signature was required for the specific shipment. After informing Google, they still claim that no refund or replacement is happening!

I've primarily used Chinese phones (Xiaomi, Oppo) and haven't experienced hardware issues with any of the 3 phones I've owned over the past 10 years.I updated phones due to receiving new ones as gifts or rewards in competitions, or when software support ended.My current phone is an Oppo A52, which I bought in 2020 at a very low price. I put a cheap case on it and have dropped it frequently. I even use the phone under light \/ heavy rain although the phone is not water resistant. The phone feels like a rock to me.I'm considering upgrading to a Pixel 8 for its long-term software support and to try a \"high-quality\" phone with a better camera. However, I've noticed on Reddit and elsewhere online that the Pixel series seems to have reliability issues, with reports of green lines on the screen or connectivity problems. I'm puzzled by how such an expensive phone, costing twice as much as my current Oppo, could be so unreliable. Are people's expectations too high?For context, I rarely use my phone, mostly for authenticator apps and calling. My 4-year-old Oppo A52 still lasts all day.For those experiencing issues with the Pixel series, how frequently do you use your phone? I'd appreciate more information to help me decide whether to go for a Pixel phone or try an iPhone for the first time"},"858":{"post_title":"Google Sent My Mother a Phone That Was Apparently Stolen","self_text":"Recently my mother bought a new Pixel 8 from the Google Store and used Synchrony to finance the phone. We are US based. After she bought the phone she went to a wedding in Canada. This is when things started to go south.Once in Canada she no longer had T-Mobile service despite other family members with iPhones on the same plan having service. When she returned to the US she still had no service. Her sim card seemed fine and worked on other phones. We eventually contact T-Mobile and they tell us that they blocked the phone from service because the phone has been marked as stolen. T-Mobile told us that Google marked the phone as stolen.We contact Google support and they know nothing about the phone being marked as stolen. They tell us to contact T-Mobile again. We tell T-Mobile that Google knows nothing and it becomes a finger pointing game. Eventually my mother gets service again but that only lasted for a few days.My mother tried going to another phone company, Visible, and they said they couldn't service the phone because it was marked as stolen. Google throughout this time has not been helpful at all. My mother has had to use her sister's phone to make phone calls and she's talked to a million people who do not really know how to help.Since the phone was not working for whatever reason, my mother attempted to return it and get a replacement phone. The issue was that she did not want to pay the price of a new phone for a refurbished phone. This is a phone that she had for about less than a month I believe.Google Support refused to send a new phone and sent a refurbished phone instead. After a lot of back and forth with support they also refused to give any kind of discount or refund any money.My mother decided reject the shipment of the refurbished phone from Fedex and has attempted to pursue the route of trying to get a full refund. Synchrony won't refund anything until Google has approved the refund and she received an email today saying they would not issue the refund. She emailed back and now they are talking about \"escalating.\"My mother is at a point where she is wanting to pursue legal assistance. What can we do? She now has no phone and a bill to pay. I'm going to submit a Reddit Request form once I get the necessary information from her.This has all been an awful experience for us taking days and I regret telling her to buy her phone from the Google Store.

Notifications - I have tried everything to fix this including turning off battery optimisation for the apps but I can't solve the issue of notifications being delayed especially from WhatsApp. There are times I open my phone and see no notifications or else notifications start popping in 20 minutes late and only after I open the phone. I have tried everything to solve this issue - I've had two Pixel 8 pros, reinstalled WhatsApp, turned off battery optimisation etc etc and nothing solves this.

No problems here as he's able to get 5G data and everything. However, he occasionally goes to China, and switches to the chinese sim card and will get no data at all. He can makes calls but can't get online. Even if his friends hot spot him (with a chinese sim i suppose), he can't get any internet connection. I just assumed since this sim has a China phone number and uses China's network there'd be no problems when he's across the border.If he uses the HK sim card and data roams there's no issue, but that's not a long term solution as the data he has for roaming isn't a lot. I've looked around and seen people talk about Pixel IMS + Shizuku to help them get around some network issues.

Wifi calling both on and off. 2g settings turned off and on. Every suggestion that Google phone support has offered has ended in the same outcomes.

A lot of features were not available for me, such as screen calling, due to living in Romania and Google not selling it officially here. I was fine with that because the phone was really good and it wasn't much of an inconvenient. At the launch of the Pixel 9 pro XL I saw all the nice features that it had, with the Pixel Studio, Gemini advanced, Add me and most importantly the Pixel screenshots.I wanted to buy this phone solely for the screenshots app because I have ADHD and I forget almost everything. I pre-ordered this phone on the 14th of August to get a better deal with the storage, and also a 200 euro discount for a buyback offer. After the phone arrived, it looked and felt awesome and premium, but when I started it and checked it, my heart sank in a sea of disappointment. The Pixel Studio and screenshots were not even installed on the phone, thinking it was from Android 14, I've opted in for Android 15 beta. There was the same issue. I've downloaded the APK from the internet, installed the app and the AI is not doing anything. The screenshots are not being processed (only manually if I go to each screenshot and press the button) and if I search anything on there for 80% is not finding anything.Another issue was regarding Gemini advanced. I couldn't get the offer, asked the Google customer support about it and after wasting an hour and a half of back-and-forward messages I was told to wait. In the end I finally got Gemini advance working, but Gemini is not good at all and cannot talk in Romanian. Though chat gpt is working perfectly in romanian. When I tried to plug a USB hub into the phone I also encountered issues. The desktop mode is not working, I cannot do anything on it, it's just showing the image on the screen but can't control it. I've tried to plug in a mouse and keyboard but only the keyboard is working, not the mouse. There are a lot more issues with this phone than I could imagine. I understand that it was just released, but I don't think there are many other phone manufacturers that releases a phone this bad.And why on earth is google discrimating Romania and other countries from EU so bad that we cannot have most of the good features that this phone can offer?

A few days ago, I made the leap from my beloved Samsung S21+ to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. I was pretty nervous about switching brands, but I\u2019m genuinely surprised by how much I love this new phone!First off, the design is sleek and modern, and the camera is absolutely stunning. The battery life has also been a pleasant surprise\u2014it lasts much longer than I expected! However, there are a few things that have irked me along the way:1. Edge Panels: I used to rely heavily on the edge panels on my Samsung for quick access to the calculator. I really missed that feature at first. I found an app called \"Panels\" that somewhat replaces it, but it\u2019s not quite the same. I ended up downloading a calculator app with a widget, but it was hard to find one that met my needs, and it just doesn\u2019t compare to the Samsung calculator in the edge panel.2. Themed Icons: I activated the \"themed icons\" feature, but it really bugs me that about 80% of my apps don\u2019t have icons. It looks so disorganized! I enjoyed the extensive customization options on my Samsung, where I could download different themes that changed the icons and more.3. Google Photos: I have to say, I really dislike Google Photos. I miss the Samsung Gallery\u2014it felt much more user-friendly and straightforward in my opinion.4. Search Bar Location: Initially, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the search bar at the bottom of the screen, especially since I was used to having the Google widget at the top on my S21+. However, I\u2019ve gotten used to it and don\u2019t mind it as much anymore!Final Tip: For anyone considering a switch from Samsung to Google Pixel, make sure to import your Samsung Notes to a different app beforehand. I lost all my important notes during the transition, and the same goes for your calendar\u2014those won\u2019t carry over either!Overall, I\u2019m really enjoying my Pixel 9 Pro XL despite a few bumps in the road.

I was satisfied with the phone and especially the pixel software, even though most Pixel-exclusive features aren't a thing in countries outside the US. After about a year, my phone began to restart unexpectedly while in my pocket. Occasionally, the screen would display a strange green tint before crashing. I found out after some trial and error that when pressed (such as being in a pocket) around the area where the screen connects to the motherboard it would crash and restart the whole phone. I got in contact with google support and they asked me to send in my device, and then they shipped a replacement back. All fine and dandy, except annoying that this happened in the middle of my exam period and switching phones is still a hassle and a lot of work.Now we come to this year, 1,5 weeks ago to be exact. When I pick up my phone from my desk it suddenly doesn't work anymore, the screen is totally black and no response from touch. I thought it had suddenly turned off but I could still feel vibrations so that was very weird. I force restarted it by holding the buttons but to no avail, the screen was fully dead, without any cracks or damage anywhere on the device. I connected it to my PC and using a little program called SCRCPY I was able to duplicate the phone to my PC and interact with it, despite the 7 series having no normal display output. On my PC I could see everything was fine with the rest of the phone and the only things that didn't work were the display, touch and fingerprint reader. It was as if they had just wholly disconnected. I had of course done the usual troubleshooting things and transferred again everything back to my 6 year old oneplus (still functioning, as you would expect from a phone).So, again what seems like the same (or at least related) problem as the year before, again in full exam period, nice! I contacted support again via chat, and due to the late hour only English support was available (I live in Belgium). I explained the problems and nice detail, all of this happened around 2 weeks after the 2 year warranty ended, yay! They said they would escalate it to a higher support tier and they would decide what should happen. I genuinely expected them to replace it again, despite being just 2 weeks out of warranty, since it was clearly a recurring issue and not caused by any misuse on my part. The phone didn't have a single crack, scratch, line or anything of the sort so normal phones don't spontaneously brick their screen without any of these things.The support (See link to other post with screenshots) replied via email in what I found quite unclear and ambiguous terms, so I had to send a couple mails back and forth to really clarify what they meant. The thing is no matter what it would always at least take a day to get a response and she would always respond in the middle of the night. She said that the RMA was denied and that I would have to pay to get it fixed. As I saw this wasn't going anywhere, as she didn't even once ask for pictures and denied any request I had to talk to higher tier support, I gave up and tried the Dutch language telephone support next.The Dutch telephone support agent was very friendly and wanted to help, but again he had no say in the matter as it was 2 weeks out of warranty and had to be put on hold so he could call to the higher tier support for a decision. He really got my situation and himself really wanted to get an RMA for me as this obviously is a ridiculous case where 2 times in 2 years some mysterious fault happened with the screen. After being on the line for over 50 minutes, most of that time waiting on hold waiting for the decision, he informed me that the upper tier support denied any RMA and I would have to have it repaired on my own dime. He didn't understand himself why it was denied as for him this seemed straightforward to him but the almighty ANTI-CUSTOMER support decided they were greedy and wanted more money for a manufacturing fault.I decide to open up the phone myself (photos in the other post linked above) and couldn't find a single thing that stood out that could've failed. I dis- and reconnected the display to see if that would solve it, but no luck. I don't even know if it is a display issue or an issue on the device side, so I can't just know for certain that a screen replacement would fix it. Sending it in alone costs \u20ac88 without any repairs being done to the phone, so fuck them and I bought the Oneplus 13 to replace this piece of shit.I know not every pixel is like this, as I have recommended them to a lot of family members and there aren't any problems with them, but I didn't buy a 1000 euro device to then have this total shitshow for my money. I'll make sure none of them will buy a Pixel ever again.TLDR; Pixel 7 pro broke twice with the same design fault, the second time it was 2 weeks out of warranty and google has been fully unhelpful and denied any repair, replacement or other solution. Beware of the quality of these phones, because 7 years of software updates are useless if the phone only lasts 2 years.

But maybe there's some issues that can be fixed. 1. How can you easily FaceTime with someone? Are my only options to continue to tell people, \"download Whatsapp, because I have an Android\". Is there no way to just simply hit a video call button and video call the person? No, I don't have Facebook and no I don't want to send a Google Meet invite to video call my family. 2. Group chats? How can Androids be in group chats with iPhone users. Work and family have different group chats. Both add me to the group chat and yet when they send messages, I do not get them. Additionally, if I add two of my friends to a group chat and send a text usually neither or just one will receive the message. 3. Airdrop? Or something similar to it? Someone wants to quickly and easily send me something like a picture or document... They say open up your airdrop.. I tell them I have an Android and they just say nevermind.

If not, I'm going to trash my Google Pixel 8 and go back to iPhone for one reason only. They actually make phones that make life simple and they work 100% of the time. "},"872":{"post_title":"UV Screen Protector Options for Pixel 8- Not Whitestone Dome","self_text":"I am VERY careful with my phones- always have screen protectors and cases. Always.Except I recently took the screen protector off of my Pixel 8. The touch wasn't as responsive, so I thought it might help. Well, it fell out of my pocket while getting out of the car... face down onto the pavement which had a few large-ish pieces of gravel which were evidently larger than the case's screen lip.And now I have two very tiny, but noticeable in certain light and by touch, scratches\/grooves on the screen. I'm upset at myself, but I'm also the timing. Just a perfect storm.Anyway, I've read that a Whitestone Dome protector can help because it uses the liquid UV glue, which would essentially fill in the tiny cracks. But... I've also seen comments with not so stellar results. Plus they're fairly expensive. Most of the other brands mentioned in the old posts seem to not be available anymore.Are there other brand options? An Amazon search for 'UV Glue Pixel 8 screen protectors' doesn't really result in many matches. I also don't want to put too much money into a screen protector because I may end up upgrading to a Pixel 9 Pro whenever there's a good deal. Been wanting a 'pro' phone in a smaller form factor for YEARS.And to add insult to injury, the touch responsiveness of the screen did not change :(. Must just be me and my cold\/dry fingers.So... sorry for the long post, but should I just put a regular tempered glass on and deal with the tiny imperfections (which would honestly drive me crazy, but I can deal), or are there UV or other screen protection options that would essentially 'erase' them?"},"873":{"post_title":"Pixel Buds are the worst product I've ever owned.","self_text":"It might be my fault for sticking to the original Pixel Buds, the ones that came before the Buds A and the Buds Pro, but hey, it was early 2021, Google only sold these and there was no announcement of new earbuds from them, reviews weren't TOO bad, so I went for it.And oh boy was it the worst experience I've ever had from start to finish.It started with having to replace them for literally 4 times, as they always kept disconnecting from my phone and didn't want to reconnect until kept in the case for 5-10 minutes. Also, every single one of them always had some degree of case defect, as the lid didn't align to the rest of the case, making an awful sound when closing. Hey, at least the last pair of earbuds seemed decent enough on this regard and only disconnected once every 10-20 days, it wasn't too bad after all. Well, unfortunately issues didn't end there. Because of course how did I not think that they could have disparity issues? Like they constantly and consistently dispaired making the left earbud play sound first and then came the right one. And the only way to fix this was\u2026 to stop any audio coming from them, wait for a couple of seconds, and then play again. Oh also did I mention that they have ALWAYS had a kind of background noise when anything was playing? It was horrible, silence apparently cannot exist with them Pixel Buds. Anyways, issues persisted all the time I've owned them and recently new ones started appearing, such as the right earbud only lasting literally A QUARTER of the time the left one does. Well, this of course only happens when I'm just listening to anything, because when I'm in a call they only last 15-20 minutes. And last but not least, some of these buds sometimes think they're charging when they're actually not, and sometimes they think the case is open while it's actually not.Before anyone says anything, yes I've contacted multiple times Google support, even with Google One, and they always had the same troubleshooting process: charge them and factory reset them. Needless to say this didn't work ever.Anyways, yes this looks like a rant and it probably is. These Pixel Buds are the reason I will never again buy any more buds from Google, they have absolutely awful support and they're terrible on every aspect. I've also never owned any other wireless earbuds before, so I can't even say they're terrible compared to X. No, they're terrible, period. All this, for an even more awful price tag of 200 \u20ac. That's disgusting. And no, I'm not trying to boycott Google. I own a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch, and they're great. Great price (not so much for the watch, but if we compare it to Apple's\u2026) and great functionalities. But come on, is this really all they can do with some earbuds?I hope they fixed these issues on their newer buds, but in the meantime I hope to have warned any potential Pixel Buds buyer. You might have a terrible experience.

I'd had android phones in the past, but switched to iPhone bc I was sick of the difficulties in texting iPhone users (including all of my friends and family) but when I saw that Apple was going to add RCS support this year, I decided to finally switch back to Android.I was very excited to go back because I had greatly missed all of the customization options available for Android phones that iPhone didn't offer. However, ever since I've made the switch, I've dealt with one problem after the other, and it's becoming impossible to set them all aside. Here's a summary of my grievances:- **Bluetooth connections break**: I have AirPods, and I use them A LOT. Ever since I got my Pixel, I've had problems with their connection. What's happens is, if I pause whatever I'm watching\/listening to for more than a few seconds, there's a 50% chance the audio playback will just stop. The song or video will keep playing as normal, but no sound will come out (AirPods still appear as connected in Bluetooth settings). SOMETIMES it will fix itself in a couple seconds, but usually the only thing I can do is disconnect from and reconnect to the AirPods in the Bluetooth settings. This is EXTREMELY frustrating because I never had this issue with my iPhone. I don't think it's the fault of the AirPods bc I have 2 pairs, and it does the same with both, and it also happens with my car radio.- Phone becomes extremely slow\/laggy: This happens somewhat randomly \u2014 usually when I'm opening a lot of apps or something. I'd be more forgiving because this is pretty normal behavior for any device that I give many tasks, but this started happening very shortly after I got the phone. Usually I just restart it to fix this.- Phone launcher goes completely blank: Sometimes, all of the icons and everything but my background disappear (apps, widgets, notifications, and everything are gone). However, I'm still able to interact with everything. *If I remember the layout well enough, I can still open apps and everything.* This happens only when I'm interacting with the app drawer in a specific way. *I don't remember exactly how, something like opening and swiping an app away too quickly maybe.* The only way I've found to fix this is by restarting the phone (although it did fix itself once).- Screen scratches easily: Shortly after getting the phone, I've noticed a couple of small, deep scratches accumulate on the screen. This never happened with my iPhone, and I don't treat it any differently. I don't keep keys or anything metal in my pocket.I still don't think I'm going to go back to iPhone, but all of these things make me question if Pixel is the way to go for me. The rest of these things, I could set aside, but the Bluetooth problems are intolerable because of how frequently I use my AirPods. It's especially frustrating because I've never had an issue like this before, and Google has done nothing about it, despite it clearly being a software issue on their end. I've seen others complain about the same thing online for a while now, and nothing's been done.EDIT: **Turning on the \"Developer options\" setting, \"Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload\", has *mostly* resolved the problem of my airpods' audio disconnecting**. It has occurred at least once or twice in the weeks since turning that setting on, but it's still a massive improvement! Credit for this solution goes to u\/braso111."},"877":{"post_title":"Google Pixel Access to 5G in South America (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) [UPDATE]","self_text":"You can read my previous post about my situation living in Brazil with a Google Pixel 7 Pro and the frustration of Google's decision to limit and\/or restrict 5G access to their Pixel phones for all of Central and South America in my other post. This post is an update to that previous post. As I previously mentioned, using an unlocked Pixel 7 Pro with my Brazilian carrier (TIM) allowed no access to their 5G network, despite being in an area well covered in 5G with a 5G plan and 5G \"capable\" phone. There seemed to be an exception to this whenever I switched service to my Google Fi sim, seemingly allowing 5G access to be whitelisted through Google Fi's MVNO and roaming agreement.Well, I have an update that I think many people will appreciate! I broke my Pixel 7 Pro a few weeks when I dropped it getting out of an Uber and decided, after much consternation, to replace it with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, even though I knew I may be continuing my 5G problem.  I decided to have my phone activated in the United States before having it shipped for 2 reasons. First, to satisfy the promotion I received I needed to activate it before October 30th and shipping something to Brazil is never predictable. Second, there's often issues with provisioning and activating phones intended to be used in the U.S. on U.S. Carter's if done outside of the country. So I preferred to ensure it activated and provisioned correctly with my U.S. number prior to receiving it. This required me to deactivate my Google Fi sim and service on the broken phone I have here in Brazil that I'm replacing. So, I currently only have my Brazilian TIM service active on my phone. It's been about a day and half since I did that and I had not left my house since then and was on wifi the whole time because I live in a bit of a rural area with limited cell service until I get a few kilometres close to the city. Leaving the house to go into the city for the first time in a couple days today I saw something very exciting pop up on my phone....5G! Now, I have also recently updated my phone to Android 15, so I can't be 100% certain what has triggered 5G to suddenly be available on my Pixel 7 Pro.  It can only be 3 possibilities, which I'm listing in order of probability (In my personal opinion):1. Deactivating my U.S. service from the phone removed some restriction that was present before. 2. Android 15 included some update that enabled 5G access that previous versions did not allow3. Google expanded 5G access to additional countries not previously covered (which I doubt because I think there would have been some sort of announcement) I hope it's the 2nd or 3rd scenario because it will mean I will have 5G access on my new Pixel 9 Pro XL even it arrives but I think it is too much of a coincidence for it not to be the 1st scenario. No matter what scenario it is (I will know when my new phone arrives) there is good news to be found here. If it is scenario 1, it potentially means you CAN buy an unlocked Pixel and use it with 5G access in Central and South American countries (at the very least Brazil). It used to only be that I saw 5G when I was actively using my Google Fi sim for data and calls. In this scenario, even when I switched service to my local Brazilian sim (with the Fi sim still on \"standby\" in the background ready to be used), I would lose 5G access. So maybe it was the complete deactivation of this service when I switched it to the new phone that enabled 5G.Either way, I am hopeful. I truly hope this was just a coincidence and something else on the software side happened or, even better, Google is rolling out 5G access to their Pixel lineup in additional countries and just hasn't announced it yet!? I'll also say that I've seen that you can root and modify phones to gain unrestricted 5G access in unsupported countries, which I might try if I find that Google locks me out of 5G access once I am again using my new dual sim phone with U.S. service on one sim and Brazilian service on the other.We shall see!"},"878":{"post_title":"Is Google EVER Going to Fix the Bug With Cellular Signal?","self_text":"I have been dealing with Google's complete denial that there's an issue with the Pixel phones holding cellular signal since at least as far back as the Pixel 3 series phones.

I haven't had a Pixel since the 5, reviews for the 9 sounded very positive, so was tempted. I hopped over to the store, picked out a 9 Pro and added a trade in for my current phone, which brought the overall cost down a lot, making it a bit of a no-brainer. Add everything to the basket, apply the discount and order. Great! Immediately after the order, I get a confimation email of the order, and two two separate emails from PayPal for two different payments taken of the same amount from Google. So I jump on to Google support, they can see a second order, hidden to me as I could only see the one, had been placed, so they cancelled it. Sorted.Except an hour later, I get an email to say my trade-in had been cancelled. I check my order, and the trade-in had been cancelled for my remaining order without any input from me. I get back on to Google's support, and spend 1.5 hours chatting to them while they see what they can do. And apparently the can't do anything. It can't be added back onto the order, and the only way to get it again would be to place another order. But I've used my 30% code and so can't use it again with the trade-in, although support found it really hard to understand that I wanted to keept the 30% off dicount AND get the trade-in.Since then there's been a lot of \"wait and see if the discount refreshes\" and \"give it 24 hours and then let's see what we can do\". I wait, I let them know the discount hasn't refreshed, and their response was that I couldn't be issued another discount as I had already used one, and to \"be assured that the device you ordered with the 30% discount is on its way to your address.\" Which I know already, and they continue to display a clear lack of understanding of what the issue is. I've not cancelled the trade-in. I assume it's happened as some part of a clerical error on their side when cancelling the other duplicate order that I hadn't placed. But there's no way at all for them to reinstate the trade-in to the current order.It's been incredibly frustrating and I will be returning the phone, as it only made sense to me to buy with both the discount and the trade-in, and I'm astonished at the glitches and lack of help I've received with what seemed like a simple process. It's definitely put me off using the Google store again and probably from the Pixel line as a whole, as I'd dred to think what would happen if I ever had an issue with a device.Ok, rant over.

file\" when transferring messages from your old device","self_text":"**TL;DR: After you transfer your messages from your old device, they often appear as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d in Google Messages.\u00a0 This eventually resolves itself, albeit still with some bugs.\u00a0 Also, Google One may prompt you to transfer MMS again.\u00a0 In my experience, doing this will create a duplicate of every image\/video and causes Google Messages to get much slower.**-----------Here are the issues I\u2019ve discovered through the process of transferring my messages (SMS, MMS, RCS) from my Pixel 8 Pro to my Pixel 9 Pro XL.\u00a0\u00a0**Read this if you transferred your messages from an old device but the images in your chat threads are showing up as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.**During initial setup, you can transfer the following from your old device to your new device.\u00a0 Transferring from your old device (in lieu of restoring from a Google One backup) is supposedly the only way to transfer RCS as-is (instead of them being converted to MMS).\u00a0\u00a0* Apps* Contacts* SMS messages* MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now reports that it contains over 70,000 messages. (Although if I view the backup in the app, it lists only around 50,000 messages, so maybe something is kinda broken.)(2)  You cannot see images and videos when you view the conversation details from within a specific chat thread.(3)  If you open an image from the search bar in Google Messages and tap \u201cSee in chat\u201d, it\u2019ll bring you to a random chat thread (mine brings me to a 2FA text thread from Lowe\u2019s, for every picture I\u2019ve tried).\u00a0 When I go to \\[...\\] > Details in that thread, all the images show up; however, they don\u2019t actually appear in the thread, only in that Details screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the 5-digit phone number for these 2FA codes may be the first to appear numerically in the database?(4)  [This article](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/08\/23\/pixel-9-google-messages-rcs-transfer\/) suggests updating your old device to the beta version of Google Messages before doing the transfer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do that and think it\u2019s ridiculous that it should be necessary.**CONCLUSION:**It appears that Google Messages is now integral to the transfer process, presumably because they\u2019re trying to transfer RCS messages as-is.\u00a0 After the transfer, you\u2019ll see that your Google Messages app storage consumes multiple GB while your Phone and Messaging Storage app database consumes almost nothing.\u00a0 Normally, the latter is at least a few GB because that\u2019s where MMS \/ text media are stored.\u00a0 Over time, things seem to migrate from the Google Messages app storage into the Phone and Messaging Storage app, but there are still bugs, as described above."},"882":{"post_title":"UK network choices (9 pro)","self_text":"UK users, I'm nearing the time to switch networks.

Don't get me wrong, the 13 Pro is an amazing device and it still works amazingly today. But I got (what I think it's) a very good price on the Pixel 8 Pro with my phone subscription - \u20ac550. So I though it would be a good moment to try something new.First things first: the phone is great! One of the things I value on a phone is the camera, because I do use it a lot and it's great to have a good camera in your pocket all the time. And let me stress this out: the cameras on the Pixel 8 Pro are amazing. Always amazing pics with a single click, and the videos... Oh, the videos look like were filmed with a good gimbal. So yes, great improvement from my previous phone.Battery life could be better. Yes, this was one of the things I saw many ppl complaining about the pixels phone. Tbh, the phone holds up an entire day with a single charge, which is sufficient for me. At the end of the day I get about 10%, which makes me anxious, but it does not go from 10 to 5% as fast as my iPhone... New batteries, sure, but I had the impression my iPhone always went down super quick after 20% of battery life.I was a bit afraid to move from a snappy and responsive iPhone to something slower. And I am glad I have not seen differences in this department. I don't know if the Pixel will age as well as my iPhone did, but hey, 2 to 3 years is more than enough for another refresh.One down side comparing both system is the fact that apps on the iPhone are just *chef's kiss* Android apps tend to be a bit more dragged or just not that rounded. I could note the difference on daily apps I use, but not on my browser (Firefox). Instagram, email, and even Google Drive apps seemed better on the iPhone.\"Ohh but they are releasing the Pixel 9 soon.\" Yes, and I am glad I did not wait more for it. Release prices are always high, and I know myself pretty well that I won't spend thaaaaat much on a phone. So if this is not an issue for you, yes, just wait a bit more and buy the most recent one. If you like to ponderate like me, then get the previous gen with a good deal. I am sure there are new lower prices every week we get closer to the new one.So yes, Pixel 8 Pro is still worth it. I would say now more than ever, with good deals around the release of the new series.\/I almost forgot to mention I was totally in the apple ecosystem. I dumped my apple watch se for a pixel watch 2. I am also satisfied with it! Great experience using both gadgets together. It gives me more useful notifications than apple's, but I also have to fine tune what I find useful or not in my watch. One thing that I just loved from the combo iPhone + Watch is the ability to unlock the watch once I unlock the phone. This is not possible with the Pixel Watch, but not a dealbrraker."},"886":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 looks great af but this RCS issue is shit lol..","self_text":"Got a new pixel 9 yesterday (9pm pst)!

However from time to time when i'm on a phone call, my caller can hear themselves because of an echo. Any idea how to solve it?My suspicions are: wifi issues (i have fast internet but i often experience packet loss while on wifi, it's pretty unstable), old sim card, software issue (for example downgrading phone app by deleting updates helped with overall sound quality) and the most trivial one - cheap case usage. Is it possible that case can cause this? I've read some do. Or maybe it's something else ie. some phone settings? Any ideas and suggestions to help me narrow it down would be much appreciated.Also i wanted to ask about the call speaker - in my case it's pretty loud and i find myself lowering it down to less than half (1-3 more than the minimum but in some cases even minimum is ok, depends on the person i'm talking to. My gf is the best example but she's loud as it is lol :-)), if i put it higher, it seems high pitched and it emphasizes \"s\" sounds to a point it's uncomfortable I've read about cases in which people got ear bleed even on the lowest settings but also heard of cases in which the speaker is actually too quiet.

So don't blame Google or your network provider.There have been many fixes which are pointless and time consuming like mobile network reset, Factory Reset, sim swap, eSIM conversion. It's not related. If you go to.. System..Reset Options..

The issue in my case is because I had kept Battery Saver On.I turned it off and phone returned to 5G without any problem..Have to contact Phone Support to close my case as they are working on it.So.. to all facing the issue..

I bought this phone when it first came out (October 2023), so it\u2019s been about a year. The moment I updated to Android 15, my Bluetooth completely stopped working. I\u2019m talking completely unresponsive, no way to turn it on, nothing.I reached out to Google Support, and they had me go through all the basic troubleshooting steps. Resetting Bluetooth and network settings? Done. Restarting the phone? Tried it. Safe mode? Tried it. Nothing worked. The Bluetooth just stayed dead, and I\u2019m left thinking, \u201cWhat now?\u201dThen, they suggested a factory reset. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about this, but they basically said they couldn\u2019t help me unless I did it. So, I went ahead and reset the entire phone\u2014still no luck. Called support again, and at this point, they had no new solutions for me. I\u2019m stuck.To make matters worse, my warranty had expired, and they told me that getting this \u201cupdate issue\u201d fixed would cost around $500 at an official Google shop\u2014half the price of the phone! When I pushed back, saying this was clearly a software issue from their update, they offered me a 20% discount on a new phone. Really?Desperate for a fix, I even opted into the Android beta program, hoping maybe it would resolve the issue. Instead, it made things worse. My phone now restarts five or six times daily, and the Bluetooth is still dead. And if I want to downgrade back to Android 15, I\u2019d have to wipe all my data completely. I\u2019m basically stuck with a glitchy, rebooting phone and no Bluetooth\u2014and Google has no real solution for me.So now, here I am, with a month of no Bluetooth on my Pixel 8 Pro, random reboots, no help from Google, and a really bad taste in my mouth.

It's two years old and I've never had an issue with it. In December, I lost one of my Pixel Pro Buds 2 earbuds and got a new set to replace. Since then, my microphone\/input audio will not pick up from my earbuds, but only from my device. Obviously this isn't ideal because the idea is for me to be able to use my buds hands free, and I have to hold my phone currently to ensure audio quality. I scoured the Internet for troubleshooting ideas and tried them all. I ended up connecting with Google support and they said my buds are defective and sent me a new pair. I just received them and the microphone still will not pick up from the new buds. So now I'm wondering if the issue is my phone or a recent system update?The earbuds microphone do not work when I make phone calls or record voice notes in any messaging app, BUT I can toggle to the buds as a microphone option in the Recording app on my phone. Has anyone had this issue? Any tips to resolve?I have tried everything from restarting my phone, ensuring my device is updated, uninstalling and reinstalling the pixel buds app, clearing my Bluetooth cache, factory resetting the earbuds, ensuring the \"phone calls\" setting is toggled on for Bluetooth.

BMW has wireless (only) Android Auto, which works quite OK, and I think in these cases is unrelated to the issues.The first issue, is that quite often when I call someone from the car, there is no sound. I don't hear the other side, and the other side doesn't hear me. Phone connection is over Bluetooth, even with wireless AA on, so I think this is a Bluetooth issue and not an AA issue. Sometimes it helps if I restart the entertainment system (which is not that fun to do during a drive), but not always. In those cases a restart of my phone helps. What is stragen, that my wife with her Samsung Galaxy S24 does not have this problem when she is using this car.The other issue is with my \"wireless\" digital car key in Google Wallet.

Firstly, the design is pretty good. The camera row gives me Bender vibes. It makes for a recognizable look but I miss the glossy top of the 3. Transferring my data was a breeze but that's to be expected. The display and overall phone size was startling and the phone is pretty heavy (with my case) but I got used to it. Sometimes I even use it to work out my arm \ud83d\ude02. There's just the bezel at the bottom of the screen that's bigger than the top one for some reason. I have a screen protector so I don't w~~ant to ~~even know how strong the Gorilla Glass is. I did drop my 3 a couple times though, and and it only ended up with one crack on one of the bottom corners, so I would assume this one's stronger.  The power button did fall out just around a week after I got this phone but I fixed it recently with the warranty, so that's there.    Display is great, but it has this green tint when viewed from a weird angle. I don't think my Pixel 3 had this. But it's not a problem at all. 90 Hz refresh rate is apparently so smooth my friends pointed it out. Maybe I've just been used to it. Couldn't care less about the notch (or camera hole) as long as I get more screen space. Plus, it makes for some creative wallpapers.    I'm not a camera person so this section will be brief. The cameras are good enough to take pictures with; zooms really far. I don't know enough about cameras to really say. Maybe they're actually better than I think.  The funny thing is the main reason I even got a new phone was because the single camera on the 3 randomly became blurry so it's ironic I didn't write more on the camera. When I get the chance to I'll try the other features like Cinematic Mode and the Photo Unblur.    I'm also not a audiophile so what I say might not be a complete review. The audio quality is pretty okay, but I do miss the front facing speakers on the 3. Yes, I know there's a speaker at the top but it's not that powerful. I think it's for when your phone isn't on speaker in a call. I didn't even notice it was there until a couple days later. Since phone cases will make a cutout of the bottom speakers, it's even easier to cover it with your fingers when watching a video or playing games. I feel like there's never a quiet sound for media volume at least. Even the lowest setting is kinda loud but that's okay. I use  wireless earbuds (Google's very own) so I'm kinda just nitpicking. All in all, no problem.    With performance, this is my first time using Google Tensor so I can't tell if the G2 is an upgrade from the original. The phone is smooth and responsive but I do notice it gets really hot when playing games. I hardly play games anymore so this isn't a problem and sometimes I can't even tell if the temperature is rising because of the case I use. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's from my hands or from the phone itself. Not gonna lie, for a phone that has double the RAM of my previous, I was expecting more processing power because sometimes when switching apps they refresh unexpectedly. It mainly happens when opening the camera app camera app. How taxing is it?!?!    Speaking of speed, the fingerprint scanner is not as fast or smart as I'd want it to be. It sometimes doesn't recognize my thumb even when it's laying flat on my screen! If the 7 is this bad, I don't want to imagine the 6. I heard some updates messed up the sensor but I'm not so sure that's true. If it is then subsequent updates should be able to fix it. When the fingerprint reader doesn't work, I switch to face unlock. I think it's more consistent than the fingerprint sensor but it seldom works in low light or when I take my glasses off, so I find myself using the PIN. I use Extend Unlock to limit the failed attempts and it's a game changer. I have it for when my phone is at home. The fingerprint scanner is still important for authenticating important transactions though.    I know people have problems with the battery, but in my honest opinion, it's completely fine. If I can end the day with 20% or more that's more than enough to rate the battery, and I usually do. Like seriously what are you guys doing on your phones? But then again I usually charge it at night time. After using it for a year, there hasn't been a big dip in battery life. Fast charging is fast enough (I'm using the cable that came with the phone) and I haven't gotten a wireless charger. What's the best one for Pixel 7? If anyone has one please let me know.      Features  Extra dim is so handy because I honestly think this phone is too bright, even at the darkest setting, so it's always toggled when I wake up. I just wish you could schedule it like Night Light. Auto-rotate is very inconsistent in it's effectiveness even if the phone is in a 180\u00b0 angle. I feel like tilting to the left side works more than tilting to the right side. I've noticed when I turn it on it says \"face-based\". Is that the reason it's so unreliable? As I mentioned in the camera section I haven't tried it but can Photo Unblur really work on older pics? That's really cool. Battery Share is cool too but it's hard to stabilize both phones.    Versus Pixel 3  In comparison, I honestly feel the colors were more colorful on the Pixel 3? It's a bummer that there's no SD card slot but I'm basically used to it. Besides you get Google One for 3 months after you get this phone. The default storage space is enough for me anyway. **The fingerprint sensor**. Was way more convenient on the back and could be used for bringing down the notification shade. Definitely the biggest loss. Cool little details of the Pixel 3 like the colored power button, Active Edge and the two-tone design are missing on the 7. Even the box package was way more interesting with stickers and stuff.      And that's my experience with the Google Pixel 7! It's a pretty long read but I wanted to cover all my bases. I didn't talk about software because most of it isn't unique to the Pixel 7. The features section is more or less about software anyway. Overall, it's a good phone that I've enjoyed but it lost some of the cool features that made the Pixel line stand out.

I sent it in for a replacement and it arrived on 01\/13\/25, I waited for them to receive it and send me a new phone for 4 business days before I contacted support. They said that they were on it and to wait 24-48 hours and I'd be sent a new phone. I waited the two business days and nothing changed at all. I then contacted support again and tried to get someone to help me (Now a week without my phone) but was told the same thing again that it would take 24-48 hours for a different team to look into it. When I protested and said that I couldn't be without my phone for much longer, that I'm required to be on call at work, they said \"Sorry that's all I can do\". When I asked to speak to a higher level up I was told \"You're going to get the same answer out of them\". So that's it I'll never buy a google phone again.

There have been some close calls with overheating on a car dashboard with GPS on and the temperamental charging port in the last year but overall very tolerable. I don't consume that much media when not at home anyway (I pay per GB) so even though the battery isn't as great as it was, a small external battery keeps it going even on multi-day camping trips. The camera is pretty outdated now and I envy my friends with their wide and zoom lenses but it's still very adequate and I get to brag about free Google Photos backup (though apparently I have still been storing in original quality). It stopped receiving security updates in Oct 2021 so that's probably not great. Storage is down to the last 3 of 65GB and I have to rotate apps in and out of installation. Don't have any games or much stored music since I opt to keep a massive birding guide that I rarely use instead. When it's really bright out I have a hard time seeing the screen even at maximum brightness. In spite of all that I was determined to keep using it until it bricked or I got hacked.   About 6 months ago I started getting the dreaded stuck power button issue, where trying to lock the phone with the power button would instead turn on the camera. It was tolerable though because I could lock it with an additional press of the power button. Then a month ago I put it on a wireless charger at a hotel to see if it would work and it short-circuited? Started doing the endless reboot for the first time. After that, brushing against the power button would not only activate the camera but also start dialing 911. I've somewhat remedied that by setting long press on the power button to activate Google Assistant. As of yesterday, the popular fix of smacking the phone against a table stopped working and even breathing on it too hard will send it into a reboot loop. It won't stay shut down.

I'd just began using it two days ago, after the unfortunate and rather sudden death of my previous phone, a standard Pixel 4 which had treated me well for nearly four years. Every so often, a song comes on that I'm not in the mood for - and I vaguely gesture at my phone, sending my playlist one song forward. And on occasion, I change playlists entirely, or perhaps to an album instead (currently on Tonic's Lemon Parade, if you haven't listened you absolutely should). In doing so, I pick up the 4 XL off the desk next to me. Its face unlock sensors fire up in this split second, knowing I'm about to try and unlock my phone. By the time I move it into position, it's already unlocked. From here I swipe around a bit on the superb (even by today's standards) 90Hz display until I find what I am looking for. If I had to describe this process in one word, it would be \"cutting-edge\". Nothing else I've tried matches the level of seamlessness I've experienced with these phones, and that's why I will continue to buy them at bargain basement prices for as long as they're available whenever I need one.# At Release: A beautifully flawed piece of hardware not quite fused perfectly with its softwareAs expected from the device to win the dubious honor of MKBHD's \"Disappointment of the Year\" award, the Pixel 4 series was far from perfect at launch. It had several glaring issues, detailed below:* **The battery life.** This was a dealbreaker for many in tech circles who looked at the phone in early days. The 4 XL struggled to get through a day under heavy use, and the standard Pixel 4? It essentially had to be a corded phone at times because of how poor its battery was. The battery life is also one of the aspects of these devices that's shown the most dramatic improvement over several years of optimization, but I'm getting ahead of myself a bit...* **Face Unlock being a completely new thing for Google.** Nothing screamed \"frontier\" any more than Google's fusion of radar motion sensing with an Apple-esque 3D face unlock system - but as one might expect, the feature needed a bit of time to marinate before it could really get good. Two significant problems presented themselves here, the primary issue being app compatibility with and development for Face Unlock. The second was not requiring open eyes to unlock the phone, which presented a potential serious privacy concern.* **Some features felt pretty half-baked.** I won't list them all, but the most significant question marks were as follows:   * Motion Sense lacked consistency and was pretty inefficient contributing to the previously mentioned battery problems.   * 90Hz sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. Long story short it would throttle down at the most random times and also NEVER worked under 75% battery initially.   * No 4K\/60fps video for some reason. \"Half-baked\" in the sense many felt it should have shown up on a phone with cameras this good.* **Low storage options and expensive upgrades.** It cost $100 to upgrade from 64GB of storage to 128GB of storage for both Pixel models, and to make matters worse, that 128GB was the cap. Felt pretty bad to have on a phone meant to be a camera beast.All of these were significant issues competitors didn't have to deal with, making it somewhat of a DOA product, right? But the potential was absolutely there, most of these issues were very solvable. And five years on, well...# Current Thoughts: Google fixed it! Also, why did they remove so many of these amazing features from newer phones?!As you can probably tell from the intro, I absolutely love the P4 experience. Face Unlock's problems were solved, I have not come across a mainstream app without support for it and there's a toggle to \"require attention\" now for security purposes. Further, Motion Sense is improved, both in consistency and functionality, and 90Hz works properly: you can even force it in Developer Options. But that pales in comparison to the largest improvement by far, which is the battery life. Google's constantly been upgrading their software battery management since the 4 series launched through the latest supported version of Android 13. These include Adaptive Battery which learns the user's patterns and improves power consumption over time, and more general optimizations. My 4 XL now seldom ends the day at less than 20% charge with my average of 4.5 hours of SOT, compared to at launch where it was struggling to make it at all. Serious improvement here and it shows that the 4 series, more than anything, just wasn't ready for prime time at release.The Pixel 4 series was also the last phone Google released with many features\/traits that have yet to make an appearance since:* Motion Sense\/Soli* Face Unlock that doesn't well, suck* Active Edge* A phone model that's actually small and pocketable* An unimpeded display (some would consider this a negative, but I REALLY do not like punch holes or notches)# Conclusion: Ahead of its time, but a special piece of tech nonethelessThe Pixel 4 series really tells us a lot about two specific entities, doesn't it? The first of which is tech media and its modern standard review format. Review a product at launch, provide a verdict, then almost never come back to it. The 4's ultimately sold poorly because of bad launch reviews even when it just kept getting better with each update. This is a systemic problem in the industry that to this day has not really been addressed. And of course, it tells us a great deal about Google itself - most notably its aggression in terms of axing features, products or concepts that aren't providing the return they're looking for. You can see it in the list I provided above on things that were either unique to or eliminated after the 4 series. If Google had a phone with modern hardware and software support in a Pixel 4 XL chassis, with Pixel 4 XL features, and five years of improvements, I would be all over it like you can't believe. Nothing to be done about it, since it is ultimately Google's decision, but it's a bit sad to think about."},"901":{"post_title":"Purchased a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold that has been stolen by delivery driver - Google refusing to help","self_text":"Posting on here as I\u2019m finding myself out of options.The short version is that I was waiting in for a new Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold today when the UK delivery company DPD updated me that the item had been delievered.The picture taken is clearly amongst other parcels, not my house.

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer. Before in the same scenario, Assistant would only answer through one of the 2 devices.What has other experiences been like?

However, I have significant concerns about accessibility, particularly with full screen magnification. I have seen different venders having different features and was reminded of this after watching LTTs video on stock android.\u00a0As someone who is legally blind\/visually impaired, the full screen magnification feature is crucial for me. On my note 10 I have set up an accessibility button on the navigation bar that allows me to easily access full screen magnification, this also works on fold 6 \u00a0(no gesture navigation). This feature has been a lifesaver, allowing me to navigate my phone at all.\u00a0I recently went to a store to try out the Pixel 8 Pro, hoping that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold would have similar accessibility features. Unfortunately, I ran into a problem: the screen magnification feature didn\u2019t seem to work. While I could turn on full screen magnification and use a small, movable magnifying lens, I could not get the entire screen to magnify. This is a major concern for me, as I rely on full screen magnification for almost everything I do on my phone.\u00a0My hesitation comes from a previous experience when I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to a Note 10. The Note 4 had an amazing feature where the S-Pen acted like a remote magnifier when hovering over the screen. Samsung removed that feature in later models, which made my transition difficult. I\u2019m worried I might face a similar loss of accessibility if I move to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\u00a0I also want to note that I compared these features on the Galaxy Fold 6, and they worked there.

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"931":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 models - price leaks Europe?","self_text":"I read in a German article about a leak with the following prices:Pixel 9:- 128 GB: 899\u20ac (Pixel 8: 799\u20ac)- 256 GB: 999\u20ac (Pixel 8: 859\u20ac)Pixel 9 Pro:- 128 GB: 1099\u20ac (P8P: 1099\u20ac)- 256 GB: 1199\u20ac (P8P: 1159\u20ac)- 512 GB: 1329\u20ac (P8P: 1299\u20ac)Pixel 9 Pro XL:- 128 GB: 1199\u20ac (P8P: 1099\u20ac)- 256 GB: 1299\u20ac (P8P: 1159\u20ac)- 512 GB: 1429\u20ac (P8P: 1299\u20ac)Pixel 9 Pro Fold:- 256 GB: 1899\u20ac (Pixel Fold: 1899\u20ac)- 512 GB: 2029\u20ac (Pixel Fold: 2019\u20ac)German source I found it on: https:\/\/stadt-bremerhaven.de\/google-pixel-9-das-sollen-die-preise-sein\/Source they are quoting: https:\/\/www.dealabs.com\/magazine\/google-pixel-9-9-pro-9-pro-xl-et-9-pro-fold-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-francais-et-les-configurations-des-nouveaux-smartphones-55115#09"},"932":{"post_title":"What is a Google Pixel to You?","self_text":"I was thinking about why I have typically chosen Pixels, and why I have decided not to buy the Pixel 9 Pro, despite it being possibly the best its been (on paper)I first got into Pixels when I had a Galaxy S6 and my friend had a Pixel 2. I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

I had just received my brand-new Google Pixel 9 Pro earlier that day, along with a Spigen screen protector, camera protector, and case. I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive.

Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG).

However, I'm not changing the numbers because it's too close to 5x and sometimes the lens won't switch anyway because the phone will prefer the main sensor in non-perfect lighting, plus the quick tap number is 5x."},"939":{"post_title":"December Update - Again?","self_text":"Looks like I just received another 2GB update to Android 15 this morning.

Changed as was bored with IPhones and iOS. Been using them constantly since IPhone 3GS. Been a good ride. Now change has come. Apple does make some good products. Haven't changed phones since 10 XS Max, as I've been waiting for that damn \"island\" to disappear. 16 was the straw. Also, not a fan of apple rebranding everything to their liking (apple intelligence?!) and their hypocritical sales policy. You're not a force for good, you're just like most companies, in it for the money, stop pretending. Always been in the garden, but never, ever a fan boy. Being a fan boy\/girl for technology is ridiculous. Be a fan of peace, politeness, and respect and good things, like good food, good weather, good times and  good tech, regardless of the brand.  Love the box. Minimal and eminently recyclable. I know it costs them peanuts, but still it's a gorgeous, minimalist, eco design. Better than the shoeboxes from before. All you need. I look at and use my phone, not the box\/casing. If a lack of wall charger or earbuds surprises you nowadays, you're in for a hard life.Lighter than my 10 XS Max. Most phones probably are nowadays. Form reminds me of a cross between iPhone 6 S Plus (Max? can't remember) and iPhone 5, for some reason, but they were my personal fave iPhones. Definitely a beauty. Rocking the silicone google case. Simplicity. Plus have insurance, so not worried about crippling drops. Set up\/moving across was a breeze. Used a cable. Took about an hour.Don't mind redoing all my passwords, like keychain or 1 Password. Gotta delete a lot. So an excuse to spring clean. Disappointed with subscription 1Password, bought a premium account, twice, a while ago. Bitwarden seems to be working fine. Also, no heating issues at all. Phone temperature stayed ambient, like the room. Even everyday usage doesn't heat it at all. But then I don't game or watch films\/series on it, that's what the Sony UHD and PS5 is for. I do watch a few Premier League matches a day though (on the weekends). Bonus, Sony uses Android TV, so I can control and talk to my TV. What a world we live in. Scary. And good. Keyboard is noiiiice. Love the haptic feedback without clicks. As I have stubby thumbs\/fingers (like pig's tits), typing seems to be pleasurable again. Had to retype everything on iPhone, although my fault, should've used swipe to type. But the predictive text and auto correct seem supremely better. I was getting some crazy, nonsensical bullshit recently on the iphone. Love the numbers at the top of the keyboard, permanently. And the very quick acces to multiple punctuation marks. The one thing missing from ios is the spacebar to move the cursor anywhere, not just one line at a time. Still, not a massive deal. Or even a small one. I'm sure an app may solve it. Like jailbreaking. I'll live and learn. Usage is easy to get used to. Swipe gestures are like ios. The universal back is a god send. Love the simplicity and logic behind usage. Although, such in depth settings too. And deep search within settings. Gobsmacked. Battery life has been stellar. All day (0700 - midnight) use with 30% left at night. 9 hours screen time. And I'm constantly playing with it and editing photos. Which brings me to the camera. One of the main reasons for getting this phone. It's amazing. Does all I want and the quality is crazy good . The built in ai is mind boggling and fun. So easy to use, especially with the pixel tips app. Macro and astrophotography in one bundle, count me in. The zoom is excellent, especially for a phone. Add Me is surprisingly useful and a blast, especially when adding 2 of the same person. Magic Eraser is also useful, better\/more convenient than using another app. Also, changing backgrounds is astoundingly good. Portait is also not too bad, when you adjust the blur manually. The pan and long exposure is fantastic, especially on a phone. Haven't tried much else, such as video. No bluetooth problems. No connection issues at all. One of the best things? The monochrome\/night mode. Absolutely love it. Like I get a new phone each night. And the always on lock screen. What have I been doing in life to miss out on these things?Gemini is fun too. Better than I thought and it does all my tasks easily, includung Hue lights, TV, disappointing but true prognosis for my team's prospects, and even opening and playing a song from Apple Music (for the lossless, still use wired speakers, earbuds). Plus quickfire questions to prove my kids wrong and that dad knows all. Only things missing, the spacebar (see above), the bottom address bar in Chrome and the tap to scroll up (know I can get it with Touch the Notch). Really not much at all considering the enjoyment and upgrades it brings. Absolutely no regrets at all. Love it. Managed to get Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Studio working, even though I live in France. Well done APK mirror and side loading, not achievable on iphone unless jail broken (which I used to do a bit of, to get Android features). Maybe because my account was originally set up in the UK and I use US English on the phone? Who knows. They just work. Overall, a highly recommend phone, coming from a 5 year old iphone. But highly recommend just the same. Magnificent piece of technology, hardware, os and cloud. Maybe I'll be back in a month complaining, but I highly doubt it. I hope. If anyone wants more in-depth details or has questions, ask away.

Within a few days, SO much dust collected under the protector.

There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions.

These are some of the important settings that I have been using since Day 1: Full resolution, 120Hz, Adaptive brightness, Overnight Adaptive charging, AOD on, Now Playing on.The phone is slightly heavier which you notice if using for longer periods continuously. Screen has been lovely and the phone has been smooth like butter, which I had given up on experiencing on any android device. Setting up was the easiest ever and I've done that many a times with custom ROMs. Apps stay loaded and ready to go making the phone feel faster (Please stop closing your apps).Finger print reader works fine 80% of the time, but I happen to have either sweaty fingers or bone dry ones. When my fingers are in normal state, the reader is highly reliable. Face unlock works fine in the day but struggles in low lighting. Phone felt slightly warm while installing Android 15 but hasn't felt so while doing anything else like split screen GPS and music on 5G data which my previous phone struggled with. Haptic motor is impressive & I love the vibration patterns on the alarm tones. For the first time in my life, I can feel notification\/call vibrations when on vibrate mode.**Modem**: I had heard of the modem issues and my previous sim was quite old so I ordered a replacement sim for free when I ordered the phone to make sure that wouldn't hinder me. I am on voice calls during my work commute (London overground mostly) via WhatsApp or Google Meet and usually struggled with reception on the Redmi which is also a 4G device causing frustration on both ends of the call. On the Pixel I only had a network breakage once throughout the 40 minute route where the train goes underground for a few seconds. My mother was quite surprised when I pointed out I had reached work as there hadn't been any major breakages on call as usual.**Camera**I'm loving the camera, especially the telephoto lens. It does get a bit tricky to handle on zoom with shaky hands like mine. Here's an [album](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bHeykXh). The zoom is interesting. I can use the telephoto from the roadside to take pics of cool flowers in someone's driveway without getting close. But the macro mode isn't as good but I guess not a lot of people use it. Maybe I'm spoilt because the Redmi has a dedicated macro lens which is low MP but still takes solid shots. The lens change is very visible while in photos and in videos.And finally **battery**. I'll just put the numbers out here for you to see and draw your own conclusions.Day 1 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/FXLKdkM)) - 55% ootb battery used without charging to setup with 3hr 53min SOT and 1% left.Day 2 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/sLsmS9Y)) - Starting the day at 100% with Wi-Fi (65%) & Data (35%) of the time on a regular workday & gym routine. 6hr 26min SOT with 10% left.Updated to android 15 Beta overnight.Day 3 ([Screenshot](https:\/\/imgur.com\/dtwCrxO)) - Full day at home on Wi-Fi. Long video calls. 9hr 13min SOT with 2% left.I'm assuming it could be either of the only Wi-Fi usage and android 15 upgrade could be the reason for the numbers on Day 3. I expect the numbers to improve over time.I hope this gives you a bit of an insight into my experience with the device.

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty\/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up. (Now if only we could adopt longer battery life to smart watches ::cough:: pixel watch ::cough::)Edit 4 - ended my day of normal-high usage at 25%. Woke up with it at 6:45 AM and laying down in bed with it now at 11:30 PM. ## Performance I don't really game much on my phone but it played Pokemon Go very easily.## Gemini vs Google Assistant? It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. \ud83d\ude02The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro. New phone has me with new lingo already Edit 5 - reworded the Gemini and Google Assistant section to make more sense.

Each case has its strengths and weaknesses, and my preferences have shifted as I've used them. Here's a breakdown of each case, focusing on materials, size\/bulk, hand feel, and protection.**1. Google Silicone Case*** **Materials:** Silicone exterior with a microfiber interior.* **Size\/Bulk:** Noticeably bulky, especially on the sides.* **Hand Feel:** Soft and smooth, but the bulk can lead to discomfort during long use.* **Protection:** Offers decent all-around protection.**2. Spigen Liquid Air*** **Materials:** Hard plastic with etched grooves.* **Size\/Bulk:** Less bulky than the Google case, providing a good balance.* **Hand Feel:** Solid grip due to the textured surface.* **Protection:** Feels sturdy, but the lack of a microfiber lining is a concern (debris caught inside can scratch).**3. Mous Super Thin Case*** **Materials:** Polycarbonate with a microfiber interior.* **Size\/Bulk:** Extremely thin, adding minimal bulk to the phone.* **Hand Feel:** Comfortable and secure grip.* **Protection:** Offers basic scratch protection, but its thinness raises concerns about drop protection.**Comparison and Conclusion:**All three cases offer a different experience. The Google case prioritizes a soft feel and official branding, but its bulk can be uncomfortable. The Spigen case strikes a balance between size and grip, but its lack of a cloth lining and seems to retain heat (especially during wireless charging). The Mous case excels in minimizing bulk and maintaining a comfortable feel, but its protection level is questionable.My current favorite is the Mous Super Thin case. Its minimal bulk and comfortable feel make it ideal for everyday use. However, if I were prioritizing drop protection, I might consider the Spigen case despite its drawbacks. The Google case, while comfortable initially, loses its appeal due to its bulk."},"950":{"post_title":"I tried, but I'm going back to Samsung ","self_text":"So I've had my pixel 9 pro xl for 2 weeks and I love it. It really is a great phone. However, there are just too many quality of life features on the Samsung phones that I can't ignore. I came from a 1,5 year old S23 Ultra and there are many things that i used daily that i really miss as more than just gimmicky.- folders: you cant have folders in the pixel app draw. I really dont understand why. This means you can only have folders on the home screen, something which i dont want as i usually have a very clean home screen. I didn't realise how much i used folders until now..- files and folders: I use my phones for work a lot and its just easier to download\/find\/access files on the samsung. I cant explain exactly what this is but if i have to send a file\/photo I have downloaded via whatsapp or email its just easier to do on the Samsung. On the Pixel, half the time i cant find the damn file I literally just downloaded unless I'm using the file app. But from within an app (Gmail, Whatsapp) its not as easy to find.- sound silence: on the samsung i just pull down from the top and in my quick settings i can silence\/vibrate my phone. On tthe pixel you have to hit the volume button, then the click the icon then choose silence icon.- At a glance: Why on earth can you not get rid of this widget or the google search bar on the home screen? Its taking space which id rather use for something else and i dont want to use another launcher to get rid of them.- Edge panel: i really miss this from the Samsung phone. Its just so handy to access apps i use regularly. Yes, you can install a third party app on the pixel, but its not the same.- Goodlock: The amount of customization allowed via this app is superb. Customization on the poxel lock screen for example is very limited in comparison.- Routines: Nothing even remotely close. Yes, there are apps for this, but its not the same as the ones offered on the Samsung phones.- Battery: I thought my year and a half year old S23Ultra was beginning to lack in this department. However, the pixel (brand new) under the same usage\/load is lasting the same and even a little less than my Samsung. Thats not say its not good! Its just not as good as i hoped considering how old my Samsung is.- Wallets: The good thing about Samsung is that you can have both Google Wallet and Samsung wallet running at the same time. So you can have multiple cards even if they dont all work on Google Wallet (minor gripe though).- Gamaxy watch: yes, i got my new Ultra watch working with the pixel, but i had to side load a few apps and the gear software really hits the battery hard. Performance using a samsung phone ia much more optimised, this is normal i guess since it's a samsung product after all.- Wallpapers: you cant have video wallpapers on the picel unless you use a third party app such as video to wallpaper, which you have to pay for and its not great since you cant have a different video from your homescreen and lockscreen. You can have one or the either or both the same, but not 2 separate videos. Samsung also allows for a list of inages\/videos that you can randomly scroll through everytime you unlock your phone.Again, im not saying the Pixel is not a great phone. It really is, but after you get over the gimmicky AI tools, its really rather simple. Camera, OS in general, performance etc are all excellent. I guess, had I not come from a Samsung phone, I would have been perfectly happy with the Pixel.So for those coming from a Samsung, if you are happy with thr Samsung OS, make sure you consider all these things.I'll be selling mine for \u00a3900 including official case and screen protectors (from Europe) if anyone is interested.Sorry guys, i tried!"},"951":{"post_title":"Pixel Fold (and fold phones in general) - Tech World has lost the plot.","self_text":"Hi guys,I'll keep this very brief but got my hands on the new Pixel fold and I'm really surprised at the muted response from the tech world towards foldable phones in general. You literally only have to use a foldable phone for about 20 minutes before realising it's the future and there's no going back to \"regular\" phones.As I said though the response from tech reviewers has been \"on the fence\" to say the least. I understand the price level is still a massive barrier (I got mine at a really good price) but even with that caveat anyone with half a brain would be raving about this new form factor but the reluctance to say anything super positive about it is baffling.I dunno, maybe when Apple brings out their foldable phone it will be \"revolutionary\" (although I think they might be reluctant to do this as it would eat massively into their iPad market).Anyway that's about it, just find the whole situation weird.EDIT: Sorry guys I think I have to clarify my post as people seem to be missing the point. I understand there are optimisation \/ durability issues etc with current foldables (although having used the foldable 9 for the last month I'm very comfortable in saying it's an awesome phone) but my point is that the reaction to the idea \/ concept of a foldable phone has been, IMO, surprisingly muted.

"},"952":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro: Image Quality Issues?","self_text":"My new Pixel 9 Pro arrived yesterday - I'd finally had enough of my Samsung Galaxy S9+'s potato-quality camera, so I couldn't wait to unbox the Pixel 9 Pro, hoping for a photographic powerhouse. While it initially seemed promising, I've encountered some significant issues, particularly with image quality.The most glaring problem is the 50MP mode. There's a noticeable half-second lag when taking photos, which makes it almost impossible to capture moving subjects. I tried to capture a sweet moment of my son kissing my wife on the cheek, but the half-second delay meant the photo captured him already pulling away. It's incredibly frustrating, so I've switched back to 12MP.Even at 12MP, image quality in indoor lighting is surprisingly poor. I've noticed excessive noise in low-light conditions, and the camera seems to struggle with dynamic range. Some photos often have overly bright shadows, giving an artificial look. Turning off HDR helps somewhat. The Pixel's processing reminds me of my early days with Lightroom, where I'd often crank up the shadows and crush the highlights \u2013 a style I've since moved on from. Unfortunately, the Pixel seems stuck in that era, giving many photos an overly processed look. In other photos the aggressive post-processing softens details and makes images appear over-smoothed. My wife even commented that it looks like I'm using a beauty filter!Comparing the Pixel to my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max under the same conditions highlights the Pixel's shortcomings even further. The iPhone consistently captures more detail, better dynamic range, althought the colours on the Pixel are nicer, imo.The shifting between lenses, going from 1x to 5x zoom is particularly noticeable and slightly jarring but not a major issue. A minor note, but despite both capturing 12MP images, the Pixel 9 Pro's photos are surprisingly smaller (around 2.1MB) compared to my old Samsung S9+'s 4.5MB files, which might explain the perceived lack of detail.While the Pixel 9 Pro's camera isn't a complete disaster, it falls short of my expectations, especially given the hype surrounding it. I'm hoping that Google can address these issues with software updates. Until then, I'm finding it hard to justify the upgrade from my old S9+.Am I missing something?"},"953":{"post_title":"Moving between iPhone and Pixel 9 Pro XL - observations after one month","self_text":"LONG POST!I know there have been loads of posts asking this question, so I thought I would let you know my experiences of running a Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 15 Pro Max in tandem for a month, and what I have noticed.Please note these are just my opinions and observations, some may be wrong and I just haven't discovered ways of doing things yet.  I also ran an Apple Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3 since release day too so will mention those at the end.*TL;DR*   Both phones have plusses and minuses and both are excellent, you won't be disappointed with either. *Watches:* AW Ultra has a better battery and is tougher but more expensive than the PW3, but the PW3 seems better at tracking sleep and fitness for me (see comment about HR readings on Ultra)*iPhone: iOS18 observations:*Tap top of screen to scroll up is a feature I really miss on the Pixel.  It's so useful. (note I am aware of the android app that does this but it's flaky and crap.)Playing music hands free using Siri - if I'm cooking I can tell Siri to play music and it does it.  Pixel Gemini won't as it says it needs to be unlocked first. Very irritating.  There is a work-around for this, which is to use your Pixel Watch if you have one as an extended unlock item and use your home address as extended unlock, but there shouldn't need to be.Add reminders hands-free using Siri - same as above.  I can tell Siri to add a reminder about something and it does it every time pretty much perfectly.  Pixel again asks to be unlocked first.Add location-based reminders hands free using Siri - can ask Siri to remind me to do something when I get home.  I have no idea what Gemini is doing here.  Most of the time it just says it can't do that, but occasionally it says it has done it, but nothing happens.  And very occasionally it adds a Google keep reminder that doesn't announce itself but is there!  This is my biggest bugbear with Gemini.Customising lock screen better on my iPhone in my opinion - I love swiping for different colours, looks and backgrounds interfacing with my photos and stuff.  And I LOVE the multicoloured time.Using collections of images as lock screen pictures - this is such a brilliant feature I was astonished to find Google no longer do this.  I can make a folder of family photos and have them swap on my lock screen. Why can't Pixel? (again yes I'm aware there is software for this but I haven't managed to find one that's free that works the same without ads or isn't flaky etc.)Interaction generally between calendar, reminders and Siri is just more flexible and powerful than on the Pixel.  Every option I need is on there.  Location based reminders, repeating, adding locations with a link to Maps, everything.  Pixels is a bit of a mess and tasks is so limited. Baffling.\u2018Bouncing\u2019 animated photos - where you can get a top-shot image (eg short video) and select it to 'bounce' back and forth. This can produce some really cool effects and looks good in the photos app.  Not possible on Pixel.Copy and paste from phone to MacBook\/iPad and vice-versa.  This is such a handy feature and I use it all the time.  Obviously Pixel is unable to do this.AirPlay to my Sonos speakers in Apple Music. Yes I'm a weirdo and use AM not Spotify.  I love being able to cast to speakers through AM not the Sonos app. (Yes I know Spotify can cast to any Sonos speakers though which AM can't natively, so this is a bonus for Pixel)The Journal app - I actually use this and there is no equivalent Pixel app as default (happy to hear people's recommendations here for one which works with iOS\/AndroidWiFi QR codes\/share WiFi password - this is new in iOS18 and is really handy as it works cross platform. As far as I know it isn't on Pixel.Safari reading mode - I hate adverts; I mean I really really HATE modern advertising.  So I use this feature all the time.  Pixel does not have it. But... actually Pixel has a better solution to this with an app from Google.  See my comments on my Pixel list.Removing annoying ads in Safari - another iOS18 feature. God I love this! Just delete all those shitty, irritating adverts and read in peace. Works in MacOS too.Measurements tool - I use this quite a lot in my job and it's great.  I work in Health and Safety and often need to measure room sizes.  The measure tool works really well. Image crop to screen size - another small but neat feature.  If you zoom in on an image to fill the screen, a box comes up asking you if you want to crop the image to make a perfect wallpaper sized image.Swipe down to search is much, much more comprehensive than Swipe up to search in Pixel. I use this feature a lot and it's great.  In fact I use this to do almost everything.  You can search for videos, photos (by person or by subject eg 'dog', 'beach', 'York Minster' etc), music, emails, images, apps, news stories, anything.  It's brilliant.  The Pixel one is just really really limited.Keyboard- space bar moved cursor in any direction on the Apple keyboard, the Google one only moves left and right. This is tedious and annoying when the spelling or change is at the start of the message and fruitlessly tapping close to it is annoying.  Apples solution is just better here.Note on keyboards: I have come to realise that I used to endlessly moan about the Apple keyboard and how annoying it was, but the Pixel one is as bad for me so it must be down to my swiping inaccuracy in the main. There is no noticeable difference for me between them.Night view mode in landscape at night is great and works really well as a bedside clock.  And a wave of the hand brings up the time in red at night if you wake up.  Really nice feature.Calendar entries: If you ask Siri to tell you your calendar entries it will tell you all of them including shared calendar entries. Gemini can only tell you Google calendar entries.  Siri is pretty shitty generally, but this is one area it really nails.Apple Pay is less faffy and seems far more reliable than Google Pay for me so far. I seem to keep having to unlock my Google Pay and re-swiping every time.  And if I have a store card it just gets completely confused.  And I often have to fish around to get the machine to read my phone.  Apple Pay just works logically and perfectly every single time.Apple fitness on the watch works really well with synchronising exercise and videos together, setting reminders to work out and so on.  Just really well thought out.Screen attention (and by extension, face unlock) is much better on the iPhone; Pixel locks the screen if I am wearing my reading glasses or in a dark room sometimes.*Now for my Pixel observations:**(Note these are for Google Pixel Pro 9 XL and Android 14)*\u2018Now playing\u2019 on the lock screen is brilliant for a music fan like me. Just love love love this feature.\u2018Now Playing\u2019 list saving all music it has heard and having a shortcut on the home screen.  So I don't even need to pay attention now, I can take a look later at what the song was.  Such a cool feature.\u2018Watch later\u2019 for YouTube suggestions, previews in Netflix accessed directly from notifications.  This is brilliant and so much easier than Apples.Notifications are a bit better generally, but I  particularly love YouTube suggestions that I can cast to my TV by a single tap from the notification, or adding something to a watch list suggestion from Three, BBC etc.Replying directly to messages from the notifications is great too.  Apple just doesn't do this.Cast to my Sonos speakers in Spotify. I don't use it but my daughter does and it's really cool to cast in the Spotify app to any Sonos speakers. iPhone can only cast to some of my Sonos speakers, not all of them.Gemini generally better than Siri by a mile (except having to unlock phone nonsense, and points mentioned above regarding calendar and location based reminders etc.). It's such a shame it isn't all integrated properly, because it frankly makes Siri look embarrassing for most stuff.  Night and day better for asking about events, places, facts, news stories, pretty much anything. Siri's \"I've found this on the web\" is embarrassing and it's not going to be until at least first Quarter 2025 before it improves.Pixel screenshots is really handy too, just started using this and find it useful.  It's great you can create reminders from it as well, but why does it not back it all up?!  Annoying.Night Sight camera is amazing.  Four minute long exposure images, very cool.Not sure whether I prefer Google Photos or Apple for memories, editing, and so on.  They are pretty closely matched for me. Not sure I like the iOS18 photos app yet to be honest so Google Photos probably gets the nod here at the moment but it's very close.  Both are some of the best software that Google and Apple have to offer.Gemini live isn't there yet.  The DEI and  preaching crap it keeps bringing up is really annoying, I don't need my *phone* to remind me that all people are equal, or women should be respected every time I ask for a fact about employment figures thanks Google.  It also needs to be able to talk to normal Gemini to create links, show photos, play music and so on. And do it when the phone is still locked Google!Call screening - I haven't used it yet but presuming it works it's a great feature.The reading mode in Safari is something I mentioned that I love for the iPhone.  Google has a free download called \"Reader mode\" and you can set it up to activate using a two finger swipe up from bottom of screen - this is actually better than iOS in some ways because it works in the news reader and loads of other apps too. It doesn't include images though, which the Apple Safari one does. This doesn't come preinstalled though.Recorder app with summary and text translation is a great feature.Split screen, although it is a bit flaky on Android 14 - Reddit always crashes using it for example.  Maybe they will fix it for Android 15? (or remove it...)Hold for me! Amazing if it works, again I haven't used it yet though.Direct my call, as aboveNotification history is a nice touch - being able to look back at all my notifications if I accidentally deleted one. Nice.Gemini feature 'ask about this screen' - option appears if this is available on the screen and you can ask questions about it. Works quite well.Selecting text via the app switcher is niceGoogle news - you can block any providers you don't like completely; Apple news leaves a big sign there saying 'you have blocked this news provider - click here to unblock' which is a big 'screw you' from Apple as far as I can see.Google lens (although this is coming in iOS) is quite cool too.Magic eraser is really good for removing things from photos; works far better than I thought possible. (Again, it is coming to iOS in the coming months.  I used the beta though and it was poor)Now a couple of observations about smart watches:Apple watch Ultra has better battery life but the PW3 will still happily get you through 24 hours including sleep tracking, working out and listening to music.Sleep tracking seems more accurate on my Pixel Watch 3, my AW seems to badly underestimate deep sleep.Exercise stuff seems pretty similar, although I should note that on my Ultra my HR monitor always disconnects, corrupting my data.  Very annoying.  Note that all my normal AW did not do this and were fine.It is much easier and better to get new watch faces on the Pixel Watch. On AW this is really flaky and annoying if you aren't using the standard faces.Ultra is far tougher than the pixel Watch, I'm still nervous about scratching my PW3.I personally prefer the strap system of the Apple watch Still waiting for my pixel buds pro 2's so no comparison there yet.Well I hope anybody looking to move between Pixel and Apple finds some of this useful. \ud83d\ude42 I'm sure I will get plenty of posts with solutions for Pixel that are like iPhone features. If so, thanks.  And remember these are just my observations and opinions!"},"954":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - Obsidian or Hazel?","self_text":"If you had to pick 1 of the 2 which would it be?I like hazel but usually go with the more classic obsidian.  Can't decide to stick with obsidian or try something different. "},"955":{"post_title":"My thoughts on the Pixel 9 Pro XL","self_text":"Warning: negative experience ahead. Fanboys beware.The Pixel 9 Pro XL is my first pixel device. I was always fascinated by Pixels since the first release, but I never got one since it's not officially sold in my region.When the Pixel 9 came out and the reviews said it was finally able to compete with other flagships I was excited.I finally got my hands on one and I've been using it exclusively since october. Everything was perfect at the start. The phone felt premium. The fingerprint sensor worked as well as my Samsung's. The UI was buttery with the smoothest animations I've ever seen on a phone. It was everything I wanted from a phone.But as time went on I started to notice annoyances that have cumulatively turned me off for good. Mostly software issues that kept getting worse and\/or  never fixed through updates.- Let's start with a simple one. My pixel was improted from Japan. The camera sounds cannot be turned off due to regulations there. Other phones will enable the option if you have an international SIM card. My SIM is not japanese and my google account is not associated with japan in any way so why is the option still disabled.- Gemini advanced free 1 year trial failed to activate on my account, and I tried 2 other accounts to no avail.- The phone can't handle rotations with gesture controls. Many many times when I switch to portrait from landscape the gesture bar will stay at the side until I swipe home from the side, then the screen will flash and get fixed.- Sometimes when I copy my credit card number it only pastes the last 4 digits? very bizzare and sounds like an app specific issue but my Samsung never did this.- The camera is far worse than I expected. I used a Samsung Galaxy S23U with GCAM mod and it was easily better. I just hated that it was slow and I had to switch to the default app for video and other modes.- The camera processing is very bad in certain situations. Like zoom, night mode, and worst of all, night mode zoom shots. The photo comes out looking incredible for half a second before the final processed image is shown. Look up a video titled \"GCam v9.6 Destroyed My Pixel Camera\" by @IDTR on youtube. I'm not the only one who noticed.- I was filming a concert the other day and in one video the camera froze for 5 seconds when I switched lenses, the outright crashed when i switched again. Very frustrating.- Telephoto RAW files are very soft with bloom effect, I thought my lense was smudged in the beginning. JPEGs looks fine but RAWs are affected and it's very difficult to fix in Lightroom.- Video stabilization is very jumpy. It will stabilize well and stay in one place while panning then suddenly jump to the side. Very strange behavior.These are some of the issues off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are more.Overall, most of the issues range from minor to hindrance but not deal breakers, until you count how many there are. I find this inexcusable for a flagship device. I've had better experience from beta releases of customs ROMs before. I still hope one day we will actually get a perfect Pixel phone but the Pixel 9 is not it. I thought I will keep mine for a few years but I'm already looking for alternatives."},"956":{"post_title":"Day 1 Impressions Pixel 9 Pro (Non-XL) (coming from OnePlus Nord 2)","self_text":"* It's a bit heavy.* Charging is slow.

When I got the 8a I did not realise how bad it is at taking photos of documents. I have not been able to capture a blur and ghosting free image of a document or receipt, no matter how much I've tried. Here is a comparison: [Pixel 8a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KGrkdvv1\/Document-Blur-PXL8a-20241221.jpg) - The center is sharp enough, the edges are a mess though. Check how blurry the corners are, and they have ghosting too, which is when the text looks like it's evaporating. In general, the 8a has a very unpleasant looking blur.[Pixel 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZ4y63Vp\/Document-Blur-PXL4a-20241221.jpg) - I was never super happy with the 4a's quality, but compared to the 8a, it takes pretty sharp pictures. There is only a slight blurring in the top right corner. [Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/L49YRKnN\/Document-Blur-L950-20241221.jpg) - Neither Pixel compares to the Lumia 950. This thing takes tack sharp images, edge-to-edge. I don't know how they managed to achieve that and what is their secret, but no phone I've tried so far has been able to match this sharpness (and the pleasant looking blur, when necessary). The 950 is not without its issues though; its white balance is pretty bad, and there is no precise adjustment for it (you just get several presets), so if you are not careful, you may end up with a result [like this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/kJdR1t9r\/Document-Blur-L950-20241221-Bad.jpg) (Still sharp though).Sometimes the trick I used on the 4a to avoid blurry edges was to take pictures at 2x resolution, but that's not enough for the 8a. Only at around 2.5x, it takes a decent picture, but then the quality suffers. Lumia 950 does not require any zooming. Does your Pixel take sharp pictures of documents?

","self_text":"I\u2019ve switched from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to a Pixel 9 Pro XL and I was so excited to see what android had to offer - until I started experiencing some serious problems with my phone. I\u2019m hoping to see if anyone has any advice about whether it\u2019s the device itself or if it\u2019s a software issue. To preface - all apps are up to date and I have the latest software installed. The problems: * Instagram keeps putting a weird red tint on any pictures taken within the app. Whether it\u2019s stories or a DM pic, any picture gets processed with a red flush on my skin. I\u2019ve confirmed my normal camera doesn\u2019t do this, and I\u2019ve turned off the Ultra HDR setting as many people seem to recommend. It gets briefly fixed when I uninstall and then reinstall the app, but it doesn\u2019t last long before the red tint returns. * Snapchat takes super laggy and buggy videos. My friends with Pixels don\u2019t notice anything, but my friends with iPhones find the videos nearly unwatchable. The app itself also seems a bit slow when moving between chats and different areas of the app. * Scrolling and normal gestures sometimes glitch and lag. When swiping up to view previously open apps, I\u2018ve had the phone refuse to open\/show the tabs. When I shut the phone off and reopen then it usually performs as normal. Going left and right between views has proven occasionally slow or unresponsive. * Thumbprint recognition and face recognition appears to be spotty and sometimes not work. * Battery is draining unusually fast. I\u2019ve been told this should fix itself within 7-10 days as the phone optimizes itself, but I\u2019m unsure how true this is. * Phone is overheating. I\u2019m giving this one grace as it seemed to only overheat when I was doing a lot, like backing up photos or downloading music, but it doesn\u2019t feel promising. In short, I can never predict when the phone will glitch and lag and prevent me from a smooth experience, and when it will act as a normal phone. I\u2019ll include the relevant settings I have on below, but I\u2019m really not loving this experience.

I happen to have a USB tester, the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and an assortment of chargers, including the official Google charger, the Ugreen Nexode 65W, and a bunch of other randos.First, please realize that the max reported charge is only available when the phone has very low battery, and it is reasonably cool. As the phone heats up, and as the battery increases in charge, the charging is intentionally slowed down. Officially, Google claims up to 70% charge in 30 minutes, with the following glorious fine print:>Fast wired charging rates (up to 27W on Pixel 9, up to 27W on Pixel 9 Pro, and up to 37W on Pixel 9 Pro XL) are based upon use of the Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger plugged into a wall outlet. Actual results may be slower. Adapters sold separately. Charging speed based upon testing with device batteries drained to 1% and charged with Google 45W USB-C\u00ae Charger. Charging testing conducted by Google in early 2024 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings with the device powered on. Charging speed depends upon many factors including usage during charging, battery age, and ambient temperature. Actual charging speed may be slower.With that in mind, here's what I've found.# Official Google ChargerPhone is at 38%, the charger pushed 17.5V, 1.96A -> 34.3W. Close to the published max of 37W, it's probably held back because I'm at 38%. When I get a chance, I'll drain the battery completely and see what we get. [https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd](https:\/\/imgur.com\/DXqATRd)# UGreen Nexode 65WThis charger supports all the appropriate specs... It  has Power Delivery (aka PD), Programmable Power Supply (aka PPS) up to 21V. This *should* have been just as good as the official charger. Unfortunately, it was not to be... Like above, with the phone at 38%, we get 8.92V, 2.91A -> 26.0W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/IC9nqKB)The charging cable I used above was a run-of-the-mill cable, only rated to 3A. I figured it's worth trying with a 5A rated cable. Unfortunately, we got the same results: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ewW0UBK)# Random Amazon Basics 65W chargerThis charger does not support PPS, so I was expecting something similar to the UGreen. It did settle in at the 9V range, but interestingly the current was kept near 2A, despite being capable of pushing 3A @ 9V. Actual output: 9.15V, 2.13A -> 19.5W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bzuRM8D)Just in case, I used the higher amp cable, but it wasn't needed - the negotiated current was kept under 3A.# Previous Google Phone ChargerI think it was from my 6a. On the adapter it said max 9V, 2A, and indeed that's what it pushed. Specifically 9.17V, 1.94A -> 17.8W: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JaHRtm7)# ConclusionsGiven my chargers, only the official Google one could max out the phone. I'm really not sure why the UGreen didn't - and frankly a bit disappointed in the purchase. Still, it was about 50% better than the non-PPS enabled chargers. Speaking of non-PPS enabled chargers, it looks like they top out at \\~9V and \\~2A, which is about half the charging ability of the native Google charger.I have read that there's an Anker charger that can manage full speeds. I have also read that a full-speed charger needs to support PPS up to 21V, and that 20V chargers wouldn't get there. But that seems odd to me considering the max charge I saw with the Google charger occurred at under 18V.That's all I got for now. If I get any more chargers, I'll add them here."},"968":{"post_title":"Weird Tap dead zone in bottom corners on Pixel 9 Pro XL","self_text":"I mostly notice in Apps that have a button in the bottom right hand side or bottom left, but it seems there is a weird dead-zone in the curved area but ONLY for tapping?

Please bear in mind these are just my opinions and I'm not a pro reviewer or anything.Firstly, wow these are so small and light!  They make my airpod pro 2s feel big.  They are really comfy to wear too. Setting up on my Pixel was a doddle and there was an update already to the software to 2.117 for buds and 1.55 for case.The sound on them for me is excellent and I like them as much as my Airpod Pro 2s.  I haven't played with the EQ and probably won't to be honest, because songs are recorded at so many different levels you'll be constantly fiddling with it, so I just leave it as is.  I'm also over fifty now so my hearing isn't top notch!The noise cancelling is excellent, and I would say as good as my Airpod Pro 2s as well so far. All of it feels really nicely made, the earphones snap into the case nicely and I look forward to seeing what the battery life is like.Now for the problems.Now this is the first pair of Pixel Buds I have owned, but the touch stuff is seriously problematic under certain situations for me so far.  I took the dog out for a walk to test them and everything was great initially, but then it started raining and suddenly everything went to shit.  Even though we were quite dry in a wood sheltering, my fingers became damp and the earphones stopped responding.  The music just stopped and the only way to get it to play again was using my phone.Then when I put my hood up and starting jogging back, the hood must have kept brushing the tips and starting and stopping the music and putting the noise cancelling on and off.  Very annoying! Especially in the rain with a dog.Anyway, once this happened it was like the earphones crashed.  Putting them back in the case then taking them out again got them working properly again.  So I don't know if this is a software glitch or not, but I'm not going back out into the rain too test then again!Another thing is knowing where to tap them.  You can't see the side of your head so you when you go to pause them for instance, you tend to be putting the volume up and down and jumping forwards and backwards a track.  I'm going to give them a while but this is really annoying for me at the moment.  Airpods just work so much better in this regard.Anyway, these are just my initial thoughts after a few hours.  Perhaps after some use I'll get better accustomed to the pads and how to use them.  I hope so because they're lovely and sound and cancelling are great.EDIT: Forgot to mention, the Gemini integration is working really well so far in the limited use I have made for it.EDIT2: multi-point connection works really really well for me.EDIT3: after saying all that about the multi point, it's stopped working!  Nothing will play on my Pixel now.  I had to put the buds back in the box, shut down all my media apps, shut my MacBook and reopen media apps on my Pixel to get it to work.  Poor!  Hopefully sorted with an update sometime in the future. Sigh ..."},"970":{"post_title":"I'm disappointed - Pixel 9","self_text":"Hello everyone. I've been using a P9 for about a month. I'm coming from a 4 years old Oneplus 8. Overall, the phone is ok, it takes great photos, but other than that and the great build quality\/design it didn't feel like much of an upgrade. I just needed a new phone because the Oneplus battery got quite fried.My issues with the phone:1. Android auto calls have no sound & microphone doesn't work. Known issue for the P9 on AA support forum.2. Apps are always killed in the background, any app. Can't keep anything running in the background (very annoying while gaming - I'm playing PUBG). I tried enabling background usage for specific apps, it didn't make a difference. This wasn't an issue on the OP83. Buttons placement4. Bottom speaker placement - it should have been on the other side of the charging port in my opinion in order to not get muffled while watching content in landscape mode.5. Charging speed is slow even compared to my 2020 Oneplus 86. It gets hot quite easily7. Battery life is not consistent, varies from one day to another8. No way to turn off the screen other than the power button (double tap on home screen for example)9. Homescreen searchbar and at a glance widget not removable10. Google photos is annoying and bad - its sole purpose is to make you purchase google drive storage11. Screen borders (bezel) too thick - compared to my 2020 OP812. Call sounds routing to headphones.When the call is ended the sound is routed to phone speakers for 2 seconds, you only hear the call ending tone in the phone speakers, not in the headphones. This is not such a big deal, but it just shows how much attention Google put into the basics of this phone - not too much.Considering all of these I'm thinking about returning the phone (I have 60 day return policy). My question here is: how many of these issues, mainly the software related ones (1, 2, 12), are also present on the P9 Pro? I like the phone overall and I would be willing to make a compromise and get the 9 Pro for the great camera and the long term support if some of these issues are not present. Otherwise I will just wait for the Oneplus 13 to be available in Europe.

This isn't to disrespect anyone, but when I was a teenager and smartphones were barely becoming a thing (heck, in high school it was rare to see an iPhone 3G) the things people complain about today, are the same things from 10-15 years ago.1. Google Tensor Performance - This is not even an issue. For 99% of people the Tensor chip performance more than adequately. My pixel experience (and my friends, and family, and co workers, who have all slowly migrated to Pixel over the years) has been relatively trouble free on Tensor. The glitches on the 6 series were ironed out mostly with the 7 series, and even then, those in my family still hanging on to the 6 or 6a, have not complained openly about connectivity. Yes, Tensor is not that great at gaming, but the games I have played on my phone (which is RARE, but includes genshin impact, brotato, and dead cells) have ran just fine without me really having complaints. I am not pro gaming on my phone, I can do that on my PC. Over all, the experience has been -> pick up phone, use phone, put phone down. I don't notice any performance issues.2. Connectivity - Other than the 6 series, there hasn't been any connectivity issues hardware wise. I have had every nexus and pixel device released to date. I haven't had these issues, and people I know haven't either. My Pixel 6 Pro consistently made phone calls in area's where my friends iPhone's and OnePlus's didn't, and vice versa. Cellular connectivity is fickle.3. Slow Fingerprint readers - seriously, other than maybe a few times in the past 10 years have I had a finger print not read, or slow to read. It reads fast enough for me to use the phone every day and not notice a single thing. 4. Bad Battery life - This is also, a silly point. Other than my Pixel 4 (non XL) and Nexus 4, battery life has been excellent, and has gone from around 1 day of use to 1.5-2 days. I charge up to 80% and get down to about 40% at the end of the day. Those of you who can drain one of these phones in less than a full day really need to keep your phone usage in check, its probably harmful.5. Inconsistent or Bad Camera Performance - What are you even talking about? Other than the iPhone, I have never seen a more consistent noob friendly point and shoot experience.6. No Pro Camera features - Seriously? Is your phone your primary DSLR? If you do any photography for work or pleasure and you want to do serious photography or videography, consider spending 1000-1500$ on a real camera instead of 1000-1500$ on a phone.7. No crazy split screen or samsung-esque productivity features - Then buy a samsung. My phone is a communications device. I use it for relatively simple and mundane tasks. Keep, Tasks, Drive, Calendar, all the regular stuff works just fine. Buy a foldable or get a 13\" Macbook Air if you need a portable productivity powerhouse.  No one is making you own a Pixel.8. Fast charging - seriously, read point 4. If you are draining your phone so fast that you need to be able to charge it 0-100 in 30 minutes at the detriment of your battery health, you have problems else where. The basic charging on the Pixel is enough to give me a 10-20% boost in 15 minutes if I need it, which based on regular usage, lasts about 6-8 hours if not longer with lighter usage.9. Overheating - What phone doesn't overheat under heavy load? Name me ONE that NEVER overheats? My Pixel's got warm just like any other phone when trying to shoot a lot of video or playing a heavy game. Light games, the phone doesn't even warm up enough to notice.10. Buggy updates - This can happen to anyone. Ask iOS users with 18.1. Or every time OneUI updates and breaks half the functions. This isn't isolated to google, and at least for me, I haven't had an update that breaks my phone (SORRY PIXEL 4A OWNERS I PRAY FOR YOU EVERY DAY).11. Bad Customer service - I have had about 4 RMAs over the years with google. My nexus 5, My Nexus 6p, My Pixel 2XL and my Pixel 7 Pro. The Nexus I got replaced due to a hairline crack at the headphone jack that happened on its own. The 6P the camera module decided to just die. The 2XL, I cracked it and had it replaced under Pixel Care or what ever its called. 7 Pro replaced for oddly, a dead wireless charging coil??? Either way, all of these were handled quickly and without question. I have had no issues with trade in's. The trades happened just like anyone would expect it to be with Apple. Get new device, send back old one. Done. 12. 128GB of storage - Really? Every time people complain about this I look at the storage on a galaxy or an iphone. They all start at 128 GB, and if they did start at 256GB (I think samsung did this) it started at a whopping 100$ MORE, thus, if you really need more storage, you were going to pay for it anyways. No one is going to give you free stuff, name me a company that does. Only OnePlus offers more storage, but I don't want a OnePlus device for me. My dad loves his OnePlus phones, so what?13. No headphone jack - get over it14. No fast wireless charging - LOL15. No 10x zoom - LOL16. I can go on and on and on.If you need something the Pixel doesn't have, go buy something that has what you need. Want the best benchmarks to flex on reddit? Go buy what ever is fastest. One something that wins the phonebuff speed test? Go buy that. Want an S pen? Go buy that. All of you who have a pixel in your hands right now and complain are just living breathing irony, as most of you criticize Apple. Guess what, most people who buy an iPhone are happy and healthy and just go about their lives. And I won't blame them. The vast majority of people buy what they want. You get what you pay for is a very literal phrase, because why are you paying for a Pixel if you want something else? Its like talking to people who complain about NVidia and don't buy AMD. Its hilarious.I am sure a lot of you can easily back me up with positive experiences using Pixel. Is it \"exciting\"? Not really. But its out of my way and out of my mind, it just works, and if it doesn't, I don't notice it."},"973":{"post_title":"Pixels Phones - Terrible Choice!","self_text":"#TeamPixel #MadeByGoogleBefore you take the plunge on what you believe to be a great new phone, think again. I, for one, learned the hard way and this is my experience... These devices are riddled with bugs, glitches, manufacturer flaws and a slew of other downright annoying \"features.\" Google Customer Support is all but useless. If you have anything currently in \"escalation,\" I hope you have a free six months on your hands! The likelihood that anyone gets back to you is slim to none. The likelihood that the person getting back to you is from your native country is 0.I was told I'd receive an escalation email (in 1-2 MINUTES) regarding one of the Pixels with DOCUMENTED widespread manufacturer defects [screen\/display problems, pink & green lines of death, tie-dye flickering] but the email never came. I spent HOURS on the phone with Pixel Repair Specialists only to be hung up on time and time again. Even their \"certified repair partner\" UBreakIFix wants nothing to do with Google devices.I sat in a \"certified\" repair shop for (I lost track of the) hours getting the run around from Google over the phone as they kept declining the authorization of my phones repair. The Manager of the tech shop even got on my call to speak with the Google rep only to be put on hold when the questions got tough! Same Manager went on to note: they run into this ALL the time with Google customers, and they have had people's phones for MONTHS - still waiting on authorization for repairs. The repairs are primarily concerning issues with warranty and EXTENDED warranty MANUFACTURER flaws. Not because they dropped their beloved Pixel 9 into the toilet. Not because their precious Pixel 8 took a tumble down the Oregon Trail. The longtime Manager also noted that they've been fixing these Google phones in droves since the PIXEL 4.Have you ever heard you will be contacted by a \"Manager,\" \"Supervisor,\" or member of the \"Escalation Team\" in 24-48 hours? Rest assured, you will NOT be contacted. And if by some miracle you are contacted, the person likely won't speak in your native tongue, AND will likely have more questions than answers! I was in awe: \"Excuse me? You called me back a month later as a member of the Escalation Team and YOU are asking ME what seems to be the problem?!?\" Honestly, it's like you're talking to the first line of defense all over again...Only to be forwarded and transferred all over the place to be asked the same questions a dozen more times. As a lifelong Samsung or Apple user, I thought I'd venture out and try a Google Pixel phone. All the rave, you know, the fantastic camera and AI and such... Boy, did I learn the hard way! The grass is definitely NOT greener on the other side. These phones pale in comparison to either Samsung or Apple. They just DO NOT COMPARE - on all levels. I could go on and on about pros & cons, and specs and such, but it is not even worth the effort. The hardware alone is subpar, hence the \"extended warranties\" on all the devices. The Google Tensor chip is plain weak. Side Note: As much as I wanted to convince my brain and eyes that the photos were immaculate, they really are no better than any other flagship phone out there. I am no photographer, though.For those of you out there that are Pixel-Lifers, more power to yah! I'm happy you made it unscathed, honestly. But a simple Google search (I know, Google, right?!?) will flood you with warranty info, defect issues and a plethora of horror stories similar to mine. Do not get lost in the shiney new toy. Stick with what you know.It really should have never gotten to this point, as any reputable company would have just fixed the phone or, hell, even replaced the damn thing! And for those of you with screen defects, it doesn't simply get better with a \"repair.\" A coworker of mine had their Pixel screen replaced THREE times only to have the problem persist within weeks if not days. Replacing a faulty display with a faulty display doesn't help too much. Hope this helps anyone out there who is on the fence about their next phone!"},"974":{"post_title":"My tips for Pixel pro 9 XL","self_text":"Received the Pro 9 XL today and I wanted to pass along a few tips for anyone doing setup. * The suggestions on this sub to change screen resolution from full to high were a good idea.  To my eyes, the text is much clearer and so far I don't see that much impact on battery usage. * If you had the pro 8, the phone seems to be precisely the same size.  However, you cannot reuse your case from the 8 Pro because the sides are now squared off vs. rounded.  I've been called an idiot for even trying, but I'm looking to save money where I can.* Setup was a breeze if you leave your old phone on and let it do the phone to phone transfer - just remember to do a System Backup first as always.  I can't believe how fast and overall good this feature is now: no more issues with RCS messages, Authenticator, etc.   It was fast but there are a couple of gotchas -- avoid my mistakes by taking steps on the old phone first !  ( I hastily reset mine too quickly).1. Disable Find My Phone in Settings. 2. Ideally remove your credit cards first, on the old Wallet, but it turns out that if you don't, Google notices that and dissassociates them from the old device, and you can go ahead and re-add them on the new one. So this is a mistake with no penalty.3. Now for the big ouch.  Most Transit passes and some cards with stored value do not transition over automically, and it's a major customer serivce operation to try to restore them on the new phone, unless you have followed some very specific instructions first.  I have Orca for Seattle and Clipper for the Bay and both are just gone.  If I go into Wallet I can only add a new fresh card without my credits.  So look up the specific instructions for each card BEFORE the upgrade because most will require steps taken on the old phone before the upgrade.  I'll post Orca's procedure as an example:https:\/\/support.myorca.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/28049799154061-How-to-transfer-your-digital-ORCA-Card-to-another-Android-Phone#:~:text=To%20transfer%20an%20ORCA%20card,Wallet%20on%20an%20Android%20phone.&text=For%20security%20purposes%2C%20transferring%20a,a%20limited%20number%20of%20times.Quick observations FWIW:* It seems that you can now use AI to turn any kind of picture of a physical card or pass into a digital pass in Google wallet, it's very cool and it works.  eg, I went into my car insurance app, and got their PDF \"proof of insurance card\" which doesn't support Wallet.  Did a screen grab, click on \"Everything Else\" in Wallet and it did OCR and created a digital equivalent, with the picture attached. Nice!* I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the reviews, but I think the speaker is quite amazing.Edits: clarity"},"975":{"post_title":"Thinking of changing to pixel but there is a lot of negativity is the phone that bad?

Please Google remove or make changes to the OIS sensor. I've had 2 Pixel 8 pros because I actually sent back my original thinking the loudness of the OIS rattle was abnormal, apparently this is normal and that's fine but it still doesn't stop rattling sounds popping up when I record videos, and when I'm lying in bed at night whatever angle I have my phone at it constantly makes a baby rattler noise when I move it to select something at the top of the screen etc - it's fecking annoying and doesn't sound right for a product of this price.2. Notifications - I have tried everything to fix this including turning off battery optimisation for the apps but I can't solve the issue of notifications being delayed especially from WhatsApp. There are times I open my phone and see no notifications or else notifications start popping in 20 minutes late and only after I open the phone. I have tried everything to solve this issue - I've had two Pixel 8 pros, reinstalled WhatsApp, turned off battery optimisation etc etc and nothing solves this.

The phone is fine aside from the fact that it's a phone that can't seem to make calls regardless of anything I do.  1. Mint Mobile side of things - I've modified settings on APN and verified repeatedly Mint Mobile support that there's nothing wrong on their end. I've dug through Mint Mobile comment history on reddit, and the best outcomes are due to 2 year old comments on APN settings.2. Pixel 8 - I've done it all. Bought a refurbished, returned the refurbished. Bought a new one, about to return the new one. Reset to factory settings. Reset network settings. Power cycled the phone. Clear call both on and off. Wifi calling both on and off. 2g settings turned off and on. Every suggestion that Google phone support has offered has ended in the same outcomes. Absolutely nothing is improving phone connectivity.What am I to do, reddit? Is the 9 going to be any different? Or is time I actually consider an Apple 15 unlocked?

again.\u00a0 In my experience, doing this will create a duplicate of every image\/video and causes Google Messages to get much slower.**-----------Here are the issues I\u2019ve discovered through the process of transferring my messages (SMS, MMS, RCS) from my Pixel 8 Pro to my Pixel 9 Pro XL.\u00a0\u00a0**Read this if you transferred your messages from an old device but the images in your chat threads are showing up as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.**During initial setup, you can transfer the following from your old device to your new device.\u00a0 Transferring from your old device (in lieu of restoring from a Google One backup) is supposedly the only way to transfer RCS as-is (instead of them being converted to MMS).\u00a0\u00a0* Apps* Contacts* SMS messages* MMS messages* Device settings* Call history\u00a0At 11:41AM, I initially transferred everything except Contacts (those sync naturally).\u00a0\u00a0After opening Google Messages, I could see that my chat threads (individual and group) seemed to transfer in-tact, but all the images instead showed an icon and the text \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 Frustrating.At 12:42 PM, I got a notification from Google Play services to \u201cRestore more data from your old device\u201d.\u00a0 It listed \u201cMMS messages\u201d (2.4 GB) with a toggle-able checkbox, and also \u201cPhotos & videos\u201d which said \u201cView your backed up photos and videos in Google Photos\u201d with a green checkmark next to it.\u00a0 I ticked the checkbox next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and hit Restore.At 1:28 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a red circle with an \u201ci\u201d in it next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d where the checkbox was previously, and a message underneath that said \u201cCouldn\u2019t restore data\u201d.\u00a0 I tapped Done.At 2:48 PM, the screen reappeared and there was now a green checkmark next to \u201cMMS messages\u201d and the text \u201c5349 of 5349\u201d.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 So it did work?Now, in Google Messages, all my images appear.\u00a0 **Twice**.\u00a0 And Google Messages runs really slowly (navigating into and out of chat threads and scrolling the main window).\u00a0 So I guess the phone determined my MMS initially did not transfer and offered to transfer them (again), duplicating everything.I decided I would delete all the contents of my messages database and start over (with the fancy new Copy feature they advertised).\u00a0\u00a0Note that SMS and MMS are traditionally stored in the Phone and Messaging Storage system app.\u00a0 I discovered that you can no longer clear the app data to delete all your texts (I think this used to work).\u00a0 Also, texts and media are not normally stored in the Google Messages app data, so clearing that app normally doesn\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 So, I then tried to use the function in SMS Backup & Restore to delete all my messages, but it failed miserably.\u00a0 So, I then attempted to manually select each chat thread and delete from within Google Messages, but things were still very slow to load and I opted instead to just factory reset.So, I repeated the above process, except this time I declined to restore MMS Messages when I got the notification sometime after the initial transfer\/setup.Again, images in my text threads were showing as \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d.\u00a0 However, I confirmed they did in fact copy over through multiple ways:(1)  Google Messages user data was consuming 2.55 GB (it\u2019s normally much smaller).\u00a0 Meanwhile, Phone and Messaging Storage user data was consuming only 1.35 MB (it\u2019s normally several GB, because this is where SMS and MMS are historically stored).(2)  The \u201cmissing\u201d images appear in search results (the search bar at the top of Google Messages).(3)  You can long-press the \u201cCan\u2019t load file\u201d icon in a chat thread and download the image.(4)  Images are visible when accessing my texts on a PC browser via messages.google.com.\u00a0 u\/brandnewcardock [discovered](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1f0gl6q\/comment\/ljy0zjy\/) that doing so fixed his issue immediately, but it didn\u2019t for me or for u\/jjolayemi who discovered that clearing Google Messages app data allegedly converted everything over into MMS.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t tried that.(5)  Lastly, **after leaving my phone plugged in overnight, my images do now appear in my chat threads in Google Messages.**\u00a0 Furthermore, the size of Google Messages and Phone and Messaging Storage have shrunk and grown considerably, respectively, indicating that text and media data do in fact migrate from GM to P&MS over time.**OTHER OBSERVATIONS:**(4)  Shortly after the factory reset and transferring from my old device again, I created a backup using SMS Backup & Restore.\u00a0 It only detected new messages that came in since I factory reset the device (42?).\u00a0 However, after allowing things to migrate between databases overnight, my SMS B&R backup now reports that it contains over 70,000 messages. (Although if I view the backup in the app, it lists only around 50,000 messages, so maybe something is kinda broken.)(2)  You cannot see images and videos when you view the conversation details from within a specific chat thread.(3)  If you open an image from the search bar in Google Messages and tap \u201cSee in chat\u201d, it\u2019ll bring you to a random chat thread (mine brings me to a 2FA text thread from Lowe\u2019s, for every picture I\u2019ve tried).\u00a0 When I go to \\[...\\] > Details in that thread, all the images show up; however, they don\u2019t actually appear in the thread, only in that Details screen.\u00a0 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the 5-digit phone number for these 2FA codes may be the first to appear numerically in the database?(4)  [This article](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/08\/23\/pixel-9-google-messages-rcs-transfer\/) suggests updating your old device to the beta version of Google Messages before doing the transfer.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do that and think it\u2019s ridiculous that it should be necessary.**CONCLUSION:**It appears that Google Messages is now integral to the transfer process, presumably because they\u2019re trying to transfer RCS messages as-is.\u00a0 After the transfer, you\u2019ll see that your Google Messages app storage consumes multiple GB while your Phone and Messaging Storage app database consumes almost nothing.\u00a0 Normally, the latter is at least a few GB because that\u2019s where MMS \/ text media are stored.\u00a0 Over time, things seem to migrate from the Google Messages app storage into the Phone and Messaging Storage app, but there are still bugs, as described above."},"998":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 - updated, but horrendous Bluetooth persists","self_text":"Pixel 9 (non-Pro\/XL).Latest update.Single device connected.My Bluetooth range for playing music through Spotify is less than 30', with a clear LoS, in an area with zero other Bluetooth devices active.

Have had this phone for maybe a month (have been a Pixel user for many years). I immediately turned off adaptive brightness when I got the phone. My eyes are very sensitive to light so it's crucial for me to manually change the brightness. I've started to notice the brightness automatically changing on a few things.1) my home screen with all my apps + date and weather - everything - all auto dimmed. The only apps that were bright were the bottom apps (phone, pics, chrome, messaging, and Gmail) 2) scrolling insta - some videos are brighter than others. Not an OP thing. It's clear my phone is changing the brightness 3) the biggest one here for me - auto adjusting the brightness on pictures. It's a brightness update just for me. So when I go to post the pic to insta, there's no auto increase in brightness. I cannot edit pics accurately because what I see vs what everyone else sees is completely different. I asked ai how to fix this. I went into Device Health Services and I reset adaptive brightness. I also cleared the history. The apps on my home screen are now all the same brightness, but the pictures are not fixed. It's not all pics btw. The one that's driving me nuts is a pic of my friends enjoying sports at my place. Theres a game on the TV and a laptop below it with another game on. The Pixel is automatically increasing the brightness on both screens to comically bright levels. Its a standard pic, not night sight. How can I completely turn this off? I don't want adaptive brightness in any situation.

Don't get me wrong, the 13 Pro is an amazing device and it still works amazingly today. But I got (what I think it's) a very good price on the Pixel 8 Pro with my phone subscription - \u20ac550. So I though it would be a good moment to try something new.First things first: the phone is great! One of the things I value on a phone is the camera, because I do use it a lot and it's great to have a good camera in your pocket all the time. And let me stress this out: the cameras on the Pixel 8 Pro are amazing. Always amazing pics with a single click, and the videos... Oh, the videos look like were filmed with a good gimbal. So yes, great improvement from my previous phone.Battery life could be better. Yes, this was one of the things I saw many ppl complaining about the pixels phone. Tbh, the phone holds up an entire day with a single charge, which is sufficient for me. At the end of the day I get about 10%, which makes me anxious, but it does not go from 10 to 5% as fast as my iPhone... New batteries, sure, but I had the impression my iPhone always went down super quick after 20% of battery life.I was a bit afraid to move from a snappy and responsive iPhone to something slower. And I am glad I have not seen differences in this department. I don't know if the Pixel will age as well as my iPhone did, but hey, 2 to 3 years is more than enough for another refresh.One down side comparing both system is the fact that apps on the iPhone are just *chef's kiss* Android apps tend to be a bit more dragged or just not that rounded. I could note the difference on daily apps I use, but not on my browser (Firefox). Instagram, email, and even Google Drive apps seemed better on the iPhone.\"Ohh but they are releasing the Pixel 9 soon.\" Yes, and I am glad I did not wait more for it. Release prices are always high, and I know myself pretty well that I won't spend thaaaaat much on a phone. So if this is not an issue for you, yes, just wait a bit more and buy the most recent one. If you like to ponderate like me, then get the previous gen with a good deal. I am sure there are new lower prices every week we get closer to the new one.So yes, Pixel 8 Pro is still worth it. I would say now more than ever, with good deals around the release of the new series.\/I almost forgot to mention I was totally in the apple ecosystem. I dumped my apple watch se for a pixel watch 2. I am also satisfied with it! Great experience using both gadgets together. It gives me more useful notifications than apple's, but I also have to fine tune what I find useful or not in my watch. One thing that I just loved from the combo iPhone + Watch is the ability to unlock the watch once I unlock the phone. This is not possible with the Pixel Watch, but not a dealbrraker."},"1001":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL Bluetooth in Car - No sound for incoming or outgoing calls","self_text":"So this happens to a friend and to me, we both have a pixel 9 pro xl.

Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"1003":{"post_title":"Switched from iPhone 15 Pro to Pixel 9 Pro XL and holy moly it's fackin awesome!\n","self_text":"This is in response to this post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1ez8t91\/switched\\_from\\_iphone\\_15\\_pro\\_to\\_pixel\\_9\\_pro\\_xl\\_and\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1ez8t91\/switched_from_iphone_15_pro_to_pixel_9_pro_xl_and\/)  I did the same thing.

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos.

I was a Motorola Droid user before the Pixel series came out, and I fell in love with the simplicity of the original Pixel XL, the slick look, the fingerprint scanner, and the capability of the phone overall. I bought my Pixel XL in July of 2017, and kept it until the battery gave up in February of 2022, when I then got the Pixel 6. I was never really overly-happy with the 6, other than the size. I felt like the battery would drain really fast with minimal use, the camera was extremely disappointing, the phone itself felt really cheap, the camera shutter made a rattling noise every time my phone would move, I could go on. Because it worked however, I kept it. The battery finally died not too long ago, and I just went to T-Mobile to trade it in for a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Good lord, right off the bat, this phone FEELS far more premium, and more worth the price tag than the 6 ever did. I like the iPhone aesthetic the phone has going on with the rounded edges. I also love the nice, large screen. I know it's not significantly bigger than the 6, but it's still noticeable to me. I especially love the new camera spot, and the way that it's raised and protected by the aluminum body, as opposed to the all-glass camera on the 6. It also has a nice weight to it, not too crazy, but enough to know you have a high-end piece of tech in your hands.As for the software, the 9 operates like I think the 6 should have. It's very reminiscent of what it felt like to switch to the original Pixel XL from my cheap Droids. The animations are smooth, and I don't even have the smooth animation option on. The themes, stock wallpapers, even ringtones are excellent. The camera is also a HUGE improvement over the 6. I would take pictures of documents to scan them with my 6, and the picture would always come out looking like my lenses were smudged, and my astral photography always left something to be desired. The camera on the 9 Pro has been phenomenal. Close-up pictures are much more clear, and the options for getting the perfect shot are plentiful. I have not tried the astral photography settings on the 9 Pro yet, but I will be doing so as soon as there's a clear night and no moon. I will say, I don't believe that the 9 Pro camera is on par with the Samsung cameras, which are some of the best on the market, but it at least rivals, if not surpasses the camera on the iPhone.Overall, Google has dramatically improved the Pixel series from the 6. The 9 Pro has better battery life, smoother operation, an overall nicer look and more premium feel, and the camera actually lives up to the hype. As long as the battery has better longevity than the battery in the 6, I'm hoping to have this phone for at least as long as I had the original Pixel XL for.

When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it. Therefore, I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold, the phone was not in the actual phone box, and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the space.I immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them. They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there. When I contact DPD, they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and they'll have to rectify\/correct.Google Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and they've ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view. I really wanted to like the phone and keep it as my daily driver, but it's just not comparable to real flagships at all."},"1020":{"post_title":"No audio through Android Auto (Pixel 9 Pro XL)","self_text":"Edit:  SOLVED!  u\/Squintz82 posted [this](https:\/\/support.google.com\/androidauto\/thread\/312020339\/no-audio-via-android-auto-after-december-2024-feature-drop?hl=en) which lead me in the right direction of what to enable.

The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences. I really hope the 9 will be a succes and makes me wanna jump back into the Pixel experience, but i think i'm gonna skip a few generations. It'll be good to fall in love with em again :)Anyway, first world problems, eh?"},"1034":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro, \"Hold For Me\" unable to answer call when the other party answers.

Here's the breakdown: * Comfort & Fit: These things are TINY.  Way smaller than the first gen, and they feel great in my ears. Haven't had any issues with them falling out, even during runs. * Sound Quality: The sound is definitely a step up from the original Pixel Buds Pro.  It's clear and balanced, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such small buds. I've been hearing a lot of talk that audiophiles won't like these, but I disagree. The profile is flat and natural. Things sound how they're supposed to sound, like a mostly true studio quality. You can turn the bass up if you need more. * ANC: Noise cancellation is solid. It's on the level of the Bose QC Earbuds, my previous daily driver, and actually sounds cleaner and feels better in the ear. * Transparency Mode:  This is where they really shine. Transparency mode is fantastic - it feels super natural, almost like you're not wearing earbuds at all. This feature is the most important to me in any earbuds and out of the many I've tried, these are hands down the best. * Multipoint: Works seamlessly.  I can switch between my phone and laptop without any issues. * Case: The case is smaller and more pocketable than the original, which is a nice touch. The buds fit more securely into them with stronger magnets, so hopefully this will alleviate the problem where your device stays connected despite being in the case. * Mics: Mic quality is very clear. * Touch controls: Basically no difference here. I've never had issues with the touch controls on previous generations.Overall:The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a solid upgrade over the original. They're comfortable, sound great, and have excellent transparency mode.  If you're looking for a pair of earbuds that integrate seamlessly with your Pixel phone, these are a great option.Let me know if you have any questions!"},"1038":{"post_title":"I guess I had a narrow escape from a FedEx scam!","self_text":"My pixel 9 pro xl was delivered today by FedEx.

That being said, I have a Windows PC and I'm using many Google apps.Long story short: I switched back to iPhone.The 16 Plus is working very well, great performance and photos, and the battery life is really great BUT... now I find the user interface and the overall experience so boring. In addition, I hate not having a general gesture for going back and I'm missing GBoard a lot.Frankly I'm surprised... I was not thinking I would have missed Android, since while I was there I was often complaining about the lack of optimization for third-party apps, some bugs, and the fact that sometimes I had to tinker with APKs, configurations and all that jazz, instead of having something that _just worked_ well as with iOS (I had a Xiaomi Note 10 Lite, so maybe some issues were related to the MIUI).For the above reasons I'm considering buying the Pixel 9 Pro XL, since I've read rave reviews and I'd also like to have a vanilla Android experience.**Is there anybody that made the switch from iPhone 15\/16 to this model?** I'd be interested to know more about:* Battery life* Reception and call quality (5G)* GPS (I've seen some posts about people complaining about poor signal)* Photo quality: I'm keen on taking landscape photos in particular; I like the results of the \"Pixel treatment\" that I've seen and I'm wondering also how it scores in low-light\/night contexts* Performance: did you notice any lag or stutter during daily activities? Any bugs?* Overheating issues?* Every Gemini\/AI feature is available also outside US?N.B.

Magic Editor, Video Boost, requires the photo to be backed up first. Since I am using OneDrive (and not Google One) to backup these photos, will I have any problem using these tools\/features?(3) Upon expiry of the free 1 year Gemini Advanced, what features that would be limited\/restricted behind the paywall?

Thinking about switching to a Pixel 9 Pro from an iPhone 12","self_text":"Hi!I\u2019ve been following the launch of the Pixel 9 as I\u2019ve always been into the smartphone world and I was quite surprised with how it came out.I always had a Samsung phone (S8 > S9+ > S20 Plus) and I grew up so tired of Samsung that I entirely left the Android ecosystem. I couldn\u2019t stand the Exynos CPU, battery life, constant overheating and the bloatware-full software that the One UI experience was then.Then I switched to an iPhone 12 in 2021 and everything has gone flawless until late 2023, where I was starting to get frequent overheating and low battery performance. I replaced the battery (it was at 80% health) and I could notice an improvement but it felt quite the same. I really liked that everything on iOS just worked and you don\u2019t have to tweak every single thing down to the last bit in order to get a great experience, that last thing just never happened with the Samsung phones that I owned. But I\u2019m quite bored of the OS and lack of customization and innovation that Apple offers.Now I\u2019m looking to upgrade my phone, as I managed to break the image stabilization of the main camera sensor (image is always out of focus) and the internet modem doesn\u2019t work out of my country as i\u2019m currently on vacation and I\u2019m stuck using 2G for 14 days for no apparent reason  (yes, I could prove it was a hardware\/phone related issue).I value the smoothness of the software, battery and cameras the most, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL manages to hit the sweet spot of all three while having a clean Software experience, but I want to know what has been your experience with Pixels as I\u2019ve never owned one and how well do they age?

"},"1054":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.","self_text":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"1055":{"post_title":"What are some things you didnt know your Google Pixel could do?","self_text":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"1056":{"post_title":"Pixel 6 keeps disconnecting from my car audio.

Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"1074":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I\u2019ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I\u2019ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer. Having said that, I\u2019ll do my best to answer any questions I can if anyone has any.

Two days ago I woke up to go the washroom, and saw my phone notifying me that it would reboot soon to install Android 15. It was charging, so I figured, no problem, do your thing. I came back from the washroom to find the screen black, but with a backlight still. I thought it was rebooting, so I waited. The backlight eventually went away, and that was it. Since then I've been unable to turn it on at all. No recovery mode, bootloader screen, no \\`adb devices\\`, nothing. It's dead, not a single light or sign of life when I charge it or plug it into a PC.I took it to an authorized repair shop, they opened the phone, tried a new battery, no luck. Apparently the internals of the pixel are not modular at all. There's a battery module, a camera module, and \"everything else\" integrated into the motherboard.I'm devastated. \"New Phone Money\" is not something that comes easy to me these days, and this happening as part of an Android update pushed by google itself feels very wrong. I contacted the support and was told that my phone was out of warranty (I bought it in 2022), and that there's nothing they can do. I found this response infuriating and unfair. If a company is pushing OTA updates, the least it can do is offer a store credit for when these updates brick someone's phone.Anyhow, I don't mean to spread fear, and so far I was only able to find 3 other Pixel 7\/7as that bricked during this update, so it's clearly not widespread enough for google to care I think."},"1076":{"post_title":"Pixel 2 XL After 5 Years: Hidden Gems You Won't Believe!","self_text":"**Hey everyone!** I wanted to share something cool I noticed after flashing my **Google Pixel 2 XL to Android 14.** I\u2019ve been using this phone for **5 years** \u2014 since January 23, 2020. As of this post, it\u2019s just over 7 years old. Until August this year, I was stuck on the last officially supported **Android 11** update. But recently, I decided to flash it to **Android 14** via a custom ROM \u2014 and I found something surprising.**Hidden Battery Indicator**After flashing the ROM, I got a status bar battery indicator above the screen! [Photo](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LtRzKou)This indicator was physically there all along, but it was never used on the officially supported Android versions for the Pixel 2 XL. It\u2019s a small touch, but a cool one \u2014 and I had no idea it even existed. Total surprise!(Interestingly, the indicator was added in Android 12, even though the Pixel 2 XL isn\u2019t officially supported on that version, showing just how much custom ROMs can unlock for older devices.)**My Experience with the Pixel 2 XL**This phone is my first Pixel, and honestly, it\u2019s the best phone I\u2019ve ever had.Yes, after 5 years, it\u2019s not as fast as it used to be: occasional stutters and some system bugs pop up. But surprisingly, Android 14 runs much better than Android 11 did. I now have almost all the features from the newer Pixels (except for the hardware upgrades like the better camera, processor, 90Hz display, etc.).**After 5 Years:**Battery: I bought the device refurbished, and the battery was at around 99-100% capacity back then. Now it\u2019s dropped to about 50%. Anyone else noticed performance drops with battery wear? Would love to hear your thoughts!Display: There\u2019s slight screen burn-in, and I cracked the screen (my bad \ud83d\ude05), but there\u2019s no phantom touch issues, so it\u2019s still usable.Heating: The phone does get warm at times, especially under load.**Conclusion**The Pixel 2 XL is truly Google magic. Even after all these years, it still provides an awesome and stable user experience. No doubt, my next phone will be a Pixel. But before that, I\u2019ll be sure to restore my Pixel 2 XL to perfect condition \u2014 it deserves it.Bravo, **Google Pixel**! \ud83d\udc4fAnyone else discovered hidden features or have long-term Pixel experiences? Drop a comment \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your stories!"},"1077":{"post_title":" From Google Pixel 7 pro to Google Pixel 9 pro XL , my thoughts and opinion if anyone is considering switching.","self_text":"I went from a P7Pro to a P9Pro XLAfter using it for 1 week now here are some observations that might help anyone considering switching.1 - DesignI personally love the 9 design, the 7 pro is not bad but I never really liked the classic pixel camera, always looked pretty fugly to me and not really premium looking. So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"1078":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro Best Buy Test: Holy crap this telephoto lens!!!11one","self_text":"Pixel 9 Pro XL at Best Buy: OMG the Telephoto is Amazing------------------**Disclaimer:** Quick Share on these devices was disabled so I had no way to get photos off. I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg). There's some text and pictures and the Pixel 9 Pro is not only sharper and clearer in text but there's far more detail. Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs. This goes to show the Pixel 9 Pro is better at both 5x (optical) and 30x (digital) zoom so it's not just down to some 30x super res zoom AI."},"1079":{"post_title":"AI Call Screening is VERY underrated","self_text":"I have to say that this feature without question is one of my favorites after switching from an iPhone to the Pixel 9 XL.I live in a swing state where my phone has been ringing non stop w\/ calls about the election.Today (day 2 of ownership) I had zero calls, because AI screened them and those jokers hung up.Thank you Google!For those of you on the fence do it.

I mean they even used to include headphones and now they don't. I liked it when they included that stuff. It felt like you could truly enjoy the phone with all these little presents. You felt like you were a valued customer and the price didn't feel as bad. As someone who's been buying from Google since the first pixel in 2016 I feel a bit betrayed I guess? I've watched this happen over the years, the prices are going up but items we typically got in the box are no longer included. This is how you treat customers who have been purchasing from you for years? Soon they'll be okay with not including the USB cord as well. This is how it starts they take little by little, they ease you into it, then they keep taking more. You barely notice until one day everything is sold separately for triple the price.This is just my opinion but I really wish it came with the charging port because I like using the brand seamlessly.  I've already been experiencing charging issues whenever I buy a different brand of charger. I'm at the point where I'm basically wiggling to get my current Google phone to charge. Well if I'm being honest my old Google charger has blown as well. However I don't know if it's because I changed the cord when the old one wore out or maybe the brand quality has gone down in the years. So I really don't want to spend $30 for another when I'm already buying a new phone for $300 more than I paid a few years ago. It's ridiculous that I have to pay any extra for something that should be included in the first place. So anyway, what's the reason for not including the port? Capitalism and greed?"},"1081":{"post_title":"Moved from Pixel 8pro to S25U","self_text":"For anyone who is considering moving. I hope this helps. I recently switched from the Pixel 8 Pro to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and here are my observations:Display: The S25 Ultra's display is noticeably better in terms of brightness and the anti-reflective coating. It performs exceptionally well under various lighting conditions.Speakers: The speakers on the S25 Ultra are significantly louder than those on the Pixel 8 Pro. Initially, I thought the Pixel had great audio, but this upgrade proved me wrong.Performance & Battery: The S25 Ultra outperforms the Pixel 8 Pro in both performance and battery life. As a heavy user who frequently takes pictures and watches videos, I no longer have to worry about running out of charge while out and about\u2014something I often wished was better on the Pixel.S Pen: This is my first phone with a stylus, so I don\u2019t really miss the Bluetooth functionality that was removed. I\u2019m still getting used to it, but it\u2019s a nice addition.Design: I wasn\u2019t a fan of the sharp corners on previous Samsung Ultra models, so I appreciate the rounded edges on this one. However, I still prefer the Pixel 8 Pro's Bay Blue color over the Jade Green I ordered for the S25 Ultra. While the Samsung looks premium, the Pixel had a cooler aesthetic in my opinion.Camera: This is where I have mixed feelings. The S25 Ultra excels in video recording, but for photography, I\u2019ve noticed some noise in darker areas\u2014something the Pixel handled much better. Knowing how powerful Google's image processing is, I\u2019ll likely install a GCam port to see if that improves the results.Haptics: The haptic feedback on the Pixel is far better than on the S25 Ultra. It feels much more precise, especially when typing with Gboard or other keyboards. I\u2019m also disappointed that Samsung still doesn\u2019t support face recognition for CTS-certified apps like banking applications.Signal Reception: The S25 Ultra has better signal reception than the Pixel 8 Pro, thanks to the Snapdragon processor.Final Thoughts: Overall, this has been a solid upgrade, especially considering the trade-in value. With promotional offers, I got around $750 for my year-old Pixel 8 Pro, while its actual trade-in value was closer to $350. The improvements in display, battery life, and performance make it worth it, but I do miss some of the Pixel\u2019s strengths\u2014especially in photography and haptics."},"1082":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 and 9 Pro XL - how are we feeling 1 week after release?","self_text":"Leading up to the release of the Pixel 9 series, it seemed like the community's reception to the release were lukewarm at best and cautiously optimistic.Now that it's been 1 week since release, how is everyone feeling about the phone?

On the Pixel 7 everywhere there is a change in direction\/material there is a sharp edge and a small gap your fingernail can catch on.

If a phone can't make calls, and access the Internet, none of the other features matter IMHO. So far things are very promising with the 9 pro. My office is a bit of a torture chamber for cell phones. I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers. If they ask for the wifi code I tend to take note of what device they are using. Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones. My company provided ATT iPhone is 1 bar of cellular, but no data. My pixel 6 & 7 pros were both completely no service, and would also burn up tons of battery just desperately trying to connect. Today is the first day I am sitting at my desk with the Pixel 9 pro XL, and it is doing fantastic. I decided not to enter in the wifi code right away, and see how it handled being at the very fringe of cell coverage. Not only can I both call, and browse the Internet at decent speeds, the battery is not taking a hit at all. It has been very miserly sipping standby battery, and hardly going down at all while idling, with no detectable heating up.I need to perform some more tests before saying for sure that it is on par with the QC modem in my Samsung, but this is definitely a big upgrade.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

The pics look really nice - much brighter than what I took in the same conditions with my S24 Ultra. It's possible that the screen is just super bright, but I'm pretty sure it's not just that - the pictures looked really bright and contrasty, maybe the best I've seen from a phone so far.What I didn't like was that it still stutters here and there, especially noticeable in the Photos app. I haven't seen the same thing with the S24 Ultra, but who knows, maybe it'll get optimized with Android 15.Overall, I think a lot of people will dig it because of the premium feel.

So overall im very happy with the new design and I think it is a massive improvement. But design is very personal, some might prefer the 9 look while others might prefer the 7.2 - Battery lifeI noticed a huge difference in battery life, I always had problems with the 7 pro in terms of Battery, it drained fast and also the charging was not really so fast. So far the 9 Pro lasts much longer for me and charges faster so im very very happy with this change.3 - PerformanceP9Pro is better in gaming especially games that are demanding, in terms of tasks and everyday use both phones are very responsive and fast.  One thing I love about the P9Pro is that it doesn't overheat nearly as fast as the P7Pro, I had a few issues with the 7 Pro overheating in certain conditions, so far no issues with the 9 Pro.4 - SignalMassive massive improvement, I am sometimes in some areas where with the P7Pro I had no signal, or extremely bad signal, it was always a problem and I was not sure if it was the phone or my operator, was even considering switching the operator... Currently with the P9Pro not only do I have signal in all those places, 95% of the time its 5G, extremely good signal, no issues, im very happy with this improvement5 - DisplayBoth are nice and good, but P9Pro definitely better with much more nits etc...6 - FeaturesBoth phones have a lot of features but P9Pro has alot of new AI features, it depends if you like that or not, personally i love it and im extremely happy with pixel studio, reimagine and all that... currently the only bad thing is they are both a bit primitive still and limited as you can not do alot of things (humans, characters etc..) but I know it will improve alot. Also the better fingerprint sensor is very welcomed. Overall very happy7 - CameraI was very happy with the P7Pro camera, its not perfect (video, selfies etc) but overall a very nice and strong camera, especially main camera, telephoto etc..I have to say the P9Pro is definitely a good improvement tho.I plan to do a comparison review this weekend or sometime in the next weeks and compare photo by photo to make this review much more detailed, but at the top of my head:-Selfie camera is much better in the P9Pro-Ultrawide is much better-Panorama and night panorama is much better-Low light and Night shots are quite alot better-Video is much better also I notice much less noise-Telephoto camera (to my suprize) is much better, when doing a x15 zoom photo or even more for example, the P9Pro has alot more details-Main camera also seems better overall in the P9Pro, alltho there is no massive improvement, the P7Pro has a very very good main camera.I also like the fact that its more vibrant with the colors, if I had one gripe with my P7Pro camera as much as I loved it (apart from selfie cam and videos needing a bit of an upgrade) it was that I usually had to up the vibrance of all my photos in edit mode, they were just a bit too washed out and not vibrant enough.More accurate review when I do a full review with photos etc..Overall im very happy to switch and I recommend it."},"1104":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Pixel 9 Pro Fold could be the name of Google's next foldable, not Fold 2","self_text":""},"1105":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Review by MrMobile: \u201cThe End of the Beginning\u201d","self_text":""},"1106":{"post_title":"[Exclusive] Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold price revealed; promo images show display size, AI features and more","self_text":""},"1107":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold won't ship until September","self_text":""},"1108":{"post_title":"Google officially confirms the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, and Pixel Fold will get an additional 2 years of OS updates","self_text":"The company has [updated a support page](https:\/\/support.google.com\/pixelphone\/answer\/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-pixel-pro-xl-pixel-pro-fold%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold%2Cpixel-a-g-pixel-pixel-a-g-pixel-a-pixel-xl-pixel) to mention that these Pixel phones are guaranteed 5 years of updates - including 5 years of OS and security updates - starting from when they went on sale.This means the Pixel 6 series will get updates to Android 16 and Android 17, while the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold will get updates to Android 17 and Android 18.H\/T Nail Sadykov"},"1109":{"post_title":"All Pixel 9 Pro upgrades over Pixel 9","self_text":"Below is the list of all the upgrades you get in the pro phone -1. 1mm extra screen size (insignificant)2.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

Through all the ups and downs, through every pixel-perfect camera upgrade and experimental feature, I\u2019ve stuck with you. I\u2019m talking G1 to Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 that\u2019s not just loyalty, that\u2019s a relationship. And yet, here we are again, mourning another product execution.Let\u2019s talk about the Maps Timeline \u2014 one of the few Google products that truly nails the intersection of nostalgia, utility, and tech. This isn\u2019t some throwaway feature. It\u2019s personal. It\u2019s my life, mapped out in a way that makes memories tangible. It\u2019s like Facebook Memories for people who actually go places. It\u2019s a reminder of where I\u2019ve been, the adventures I\u2019ve had, the little spots that made trips magical. It\u2019s a time capsule, not just data.But now you\u2019re taking it away. Why? Why? Is it privacy? Fine, make it opt-in. Is it cost? Charge me for it. Slap it into Google One, bundle it with Workspace, put it in a subscription \u2014 I\u2019ll pay for the privilege of keeping my own memories intact.

I'm really enjoying the phone so far but one thing I havent been able to get over is how EXTREMELY slow photos and videos are to load in Google Photos just when scrolling through the photos app. When I tap on a photo to open one, it is grey for around 2-5 seconds and then a low res photo appears and then another 2-5 seconds for the full res photo to finally load. Not only this, but the phone heats up signficantly when just scrolling through the photos app and uses up a lot of the battery. The photos are all on the local device and the app is saying that it also has finished backing up all the photos to the cloud.     I found that it isn't just in Google Photos too. I installed the Google Gallery app and although it is significantly better than Google Photos in terms of speed, it still takes a second or two to load the photos. The same thing happens on airplane mode without a connection and with a fast internet connection. I have tried restarting the phone, and uninstalling update, re-updating it through the play store and restarting the phone, but the issue still happens. I have also noticed that when going to find videos in the videos folder in Google Photos, when i scroll to the bottom, it shows the correct date (e.g. 2013) but with the wrong videos. This is the case for a lot of the videos. Instead they are showing a duplicate of a newer video and when I open it, it brings me to that new video. And when exiting out of that video, it brings me to the new date (2024). It's as if the app knows that the video is the one from 2024 but its showing them under 2013. There are 20+ videos like this. However, the videos are correct in the general photos tab when I scroll down. I believe the issue is to do with Google Photos not having finished processing all the photos, and still doing it in the background, making the phone overheat and lag when scrolling and viewing photos. However, I see no progress bar or how to force those updates. I also theorise it might have to do with the iPhone photo formats? If anyone else who switched from iPhone to Pixel have noticed the same issues, what did you do to fix it? It is such a deal breaker when the big screen is so good for viewing photos, but the experience with the app is so poor.(I transfered around 7000 photos+videos from my iPhone and uploaded them all over the span of the first 2 days of having the Pixel.)"},"1132":{"post_title":"Is Google aware of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold magnetic mount problem?","self_text":"Many people attach metal panels or buy special cases to allow their phone to mount inside of their car using magnets.

Since the 3 weeks after Gemini has been activated on my Google account, I've noticed a handful of problems that make life a lot less convenient.1) The \"Hey Google\" prompt is now annoying as heck. Gemini answers rather than Google Assistant, and Gemini doesn't always do the things Assistant does or did. For example when I ask Google to turn of the TV, Gemini will tell me it can't do that. So I have to prompt \"Hey Google. Use Google Assistant to turn off the TV\" which works, but annoying I have to specify which assistant to use.2) Whenever I prompt my Pixel device to do anything hands free - like make a call, msg, set a timer, play a song, etc. it requires me to unlock my device. Which defeats the purpose of me asking it to. I'm guessing Gemini can't access the voice match of Google Assistant.3) It's impacted my Google home devices too. When I ask my Google Home to give me the weather, it gives me the weather in Celsius. But when my partner asks, it gives it in fahrenheit. This is confusing and inconvenient 4) Google Home also doesn't seem to know the existence of Gemini, so when I make a \"Hey Google\" prompt when my Home device and Pixel device are near each other, they both answer.

This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"1146":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro fold ","self_text":"I am trying to buy a official google case but it seems to be sold out everywhere.

When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text.

No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger.

I am on the ground floor of a large building with a cell tower on top, but the signal needs to penetrate through 7 stories of concrete, and rebar to reach my office. There are talks of adding micro cells, but for now it is a known dead spot for most people who visit, anywhere but the top floors. We have wifi, and it has allowed me to  glean some good empirical data over the years, as different people have stopped by with different devices\/cellular providers. If they ask for the wifi code I tend to take note of what device they are using. Anyway my personal Z Fold 4 on T-Mobile can successfully make calls, and browse the Internet at my desk, which is not something I can say for most other phones. My company provided ATT iPhone is 1 bar of cellular, but no data. My pixel 6 & 7 pros were both completely no service, and would also burn up tons of battery just desperately trying to connect. Today is the first day I am sitting at my desk with the Pixel 9 pro XL, and it is doing fantastic. I decided not to enter in the wifi code right away, and see how it handled being at the very fringe of cell coverage. Not only can I both call, and browse the Internet at decent speeds, the battery is not taking a hit at all. It has been very miserly sipping standby battery, and hardly going down at all while idling, with no detectable heating up.I need to perform some more tests before saying for sure that it is on par with the QC modem in my Samsung, but this is definitely a big upgrade. I also noticed it came close to maxing out my 500mbps wifi at home last night. The 7 was better in that regard, but the 6 pro even had spotty wifi performance at times.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken.

To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone.

Google refused to fix it, and I was in dire need of a phone at the time so I was able to trade it in (thank God) for a Pixel 7 Pro. The P7P has been the worst performing and least reliable of the 4 Google phones I've owned. One year and 3 months after purchasing this $900 phone, while I still owe about $400 on it, it's a useless brick. First, the screen went, then the fingerprint sensor, then the proximity sensor (the one that locks the screen when you put the phone to your ear). For the last month I have had no battery gauge, the display would stick at a random percentage all day long and then sprint to 0 right before bed. Then, finally, this past Wednesday the display simply stopped working. No device will recognize it, all of the sounds come out distorted, and as of today (Saturday at time of writing) the only thing that still functions is my preset alarms, which produce a terrible croaking noise and can't be disabled. I'm heartbroken, truly. I loved my Pixels and used to tell everyone to buy one.

I was so excited, but I ended up being late to my own party because I was waiting for the Spigen gear to arrive!After a great dinner at a friend\u2019s place on the 20th floor, we were heading to the next location when someone accidentally bumped into me, and the worst happened \u2013 I dropped my phone straight into the elevator shaft! \ud83d\ude31We went down to see if we could hear it, and guess what? It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive. They suggested waiting until Monday so it would be cheaper - around \u20ac500, especially if it\u2019s on the route of the maintenance guy. So here\u2019s my dilemma \u2013 should I take the risk and pay to retrieve it, hoping it\u2019s still alive and functional, or leave it there and cut my losses? It\u2019s a brand-new, expensive phone, but \u20ac500 is a lot of money if it\u2019s completely broken\u2026What would you all do? Anyone else ever been through this? Could my protective gear have saved my Pixel 9 Pro?[lift shaft ](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TZTSg3a.png)Update #1:Spend 1 hour with my magnet on a stick to poke around the shaft, but it's way deeper than my stick could reach. Tried to use my flashlight on every side to see if it's on the ground somewhere, but was unable to spot it. I think I was able to see only 5% of the whole area.I'll make some calls tomorrow to the building manager and the lift shaft maintenance company!Update#2I tried for 2 days to get contact with the company that does the maintenance. Called like 5-10 times. They would call back etc, but never did.Last time I called I said: \"I've read about a fire hazard risk, because the Li-on battery could be broken and explode in a few days, I've read about this online, could you add this to the ticket and let your supervisor know about this?\".Looks like that worked, because they will be at the building this week!Update #3Today was maintainance day and they found the phone. They will hand it over to me tomorrow. But they already made a picture and video and told us it was completely crushed, not working etc. I'll post the pics when I have it! And a complete rapport tomorrow.Update #4The video [The Video of the pixel 9 pro after the 20 Stories fall](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YAS4V0x.mp4)"},"1183":{"post_title":"My honest pixel 9 pro review after almost 4 months","self_text":"I picked up a obsidian 9 pro (256 GB) from my carrier that was $800 off as part of my phone plan (only had to pay \\~300 out of pocket). I previously had the pixel 7 for about a year and a half, and before that the iPhone 12 (will never be returning to fruit company ever again).In my opinion, the 9 pro is better than the 7 in almost every way possible. Otherwise, I would have waited until the 10 to upgrade. Currently I will probably upgrade when the 12 or 13 releases, as I see no reason to upgrade until then and it will give google more time to iron out some of their \\*quirks\\*.  I love the smaller 9 pro and the form factor is much better than the 7 (although I hope they make the aspect ratio more like samsung or iphone in the future).The Screen: the screen is absolutely amazing. Colours are very vibrant and rich and the 3000 nits peak brightness is very handy for outdoor viewing. The 120 hz refresh rate is a nice upgrade from the 90 of my 7, especially being LTPO.Battery life: the battery is fantastic on this phone FOR MY USE!! I use my phone for an average of 2 to 3 hours a day and will regularly end the day with 40 to 50 percent. No real complaints here. I have pushed it a couple of times on days where I used it more and was around 7 hours of SOT with about 15-20 % remaining.Cameras: The camera on this phone is great and I personally love the pixel look. The telephoto lens along with the upgraded sensors is a nice upgrade from my 7. The only thing I wish they would change is the lens lag you get when switching between them. Other than that, again fantastic cameras. My friend has an iPhone 15 pro and he thought even the 7 took better photos than his phone, much less the 9 pro.Performance: I know this one is kinda iffy especially for a 1000 dollars phone, but I definitely notice an upgrade from my 7. Obviously, it isnt on par with the latest from samsung or apply, but for everyday sue, it is great and you wont be able to notice a difference. I almost never game and if I do they are smaller, not as demanding games, so for my use the performance is perfect! The main area you can tell the difference in is gaming, and also apps opening (google please add UFS 4.0 storage in the 10 series).Thanks for listening to my rant :)Edits:The modem: the modem is much much better than my 7. I have never had a single time where I have had cell reception issues or anything of the like in the 4 months! My drive back to school has a good 20 or 30 minutes stretch that is in the middle of nowhere and my 7 would sometimes struggle there, my 9 pro never has!Bio-metrics: The fingerprint reader is MUCH better, like not even close. The face unlock is also very nice and snappy, but doesn't work well in the dark."},"1184":{"post_title":"iOS vs Android (Pixel) comparison. Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"1185":{"post_title":"Official Google support rep tried to phish my account","self_text":"***See bottom update, turns out the verification prompt was legit and how Google does things.***Hey folks,I posted this on r\/Scams but I figured it was warranted to share here as well given this began through the built in support system on my pixel 9 pro.Sooooo, I went through the tips & support menu of my new pixel 9 pro and requested a callback regarding pixel 4a appeasement issues (trying to switch from pixel store credit to either the cash or battery repair of my 4a). I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him \"absolutely not\" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, \"do you have access to your pixel 4a?\" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u\/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate. I very much dislike that this is how it's done but I'm glad my info was not exposed to a bad actor.My apologies folks."},"1186":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience","self_text":"Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro. Have the phone since thursday and today i had it with me for the first time on my sidejob i do when im not occupied with my studies. While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"1187":{"post_title":"120hz Scroll stutter is still pathetic on the Pixel 8","self_text":"# EDIT: The Android 15 update has improved scrolling a lot, apps like Messages, Playstore and Spotify are noticeably smoother. It's now around 99% of the way there compared to the S23 (SD 8 Gen2).It's been 10 months since release, numerous updates and \"feature drops\", yet this phone still has micro stutters while scrolling in Google messages chats, the playstore and the Fitbit app (smooth display is on).

","self_text":"It was brought to my attention that I forgot to specify which pixel.  It's the pixel 9 pro XL.  This does not apply to any of the other pixel phonesI bought a whole bunch of cases one by one. Tried them all out. Wasted a bunch of time and money. Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"1189":{"post_title":"This is what I've been missing?! ","self_text":"Up until the iPhone 14 Pro Max, I've always been iPhone.

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

This isn't always the case though. If you use Night Sight with decent lighting and can max out the slider on shutter speed, then you will get a good\/better image with 50 MP.### Top shotYou don't get this with 50 MP.### Final wordI spent many hours on this.

It seems Google has done a better job this year blending the two different images.EDIT: So apparently it's a 4.85x telephoto and not 5x. I've updated my testing to reflect this. However, I'm not changing the numbers because it's too close to 5x and sometimes the lens won't switch anyway because the phone will prefer the main sensor in non-perfect lighting, plus the quick tap number is 5x."},"1197":{"post_title":"My story from iPhone to Pixel and vice versa","self_text":"I\u2019m an iPhone user from a long time ago, I\u2019ve used iPhone 6s, iPhone XS Max, 11 pro max, 13 pro max and now I\u2019m using 14 pro max. Pretty good devices except software, on the other side these devices are reliable and work well but software can be boring if used for a long time. I\u2019ve always liked Android and how much you can customize it, used Samsung phone in between but found it full of bloatware that you can\u2019t remove. Pixel started looking promising when they launched 7 and I bought one but returned it because of heating issues. Finally I bought Pixel 8 and was using it from last 3 months but I went back to using iPhone as I found that Pixel 8 is not reliable.

"},"1198":{"post_title":"The things I like about Android","self_text":"Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."},"1199":{"post_title":"December Update - Again?","self_text":"Looks like I just received another 2GB update to Android 15 this morning.

At first, I was super excited like everyone else. When I got the phone, my initial thought was that it looked amazing. I quickly set it up and was really impressed with the new fingerprint sensor. The phone did get pretty hot during setup, but that's probably normal.I transferred my eSIM from my S24 Ultra and started using the Pixel as my daily driver. Unfortunately, the very next day, I was in for a shock when I went to my local grocery store. I realized the connectivity wasn't much better than my old Pixel 8 Pro. The phone switched to 3G, and the data speed dropped dramatically, making it almost unusable. I quickly checked my wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max, and it still had a perfect connection with great data transfer. Even phone calls were choppy.The next day, I went back to the same shop with my S24 Ultra, and there wasn't any issue. Fast forward a couple of days, and we went on a trip with our kids. My wife and I took lots of pictures - me with the Pixel and her with the iPhone. On the small screens, everything looked fine, but when we reviewed the photos on a computer, oh man, the Pixel's portrait shots were way worse. The edge detection was awful, and the kids' skin looked weirdly smoothed out, like they had makeup on to hide imperfections. The other pictures were okay, maybe comparable to the iPhone's.The final straw that made me decide to return the Pixel was the animation stuttering, especially noticeable during transitions and scrolling. Twitter also acted up, often failing to load pictures and videos. I had to force-close and restart it multiple times a day to get it working properly.Sorry, but it just doesn't feel like a premium phone. Google should either offer a better price or better specs. In my opinion, this phone is worth no more than 600 euros, not 1200. I know I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this post, but this is my experience and personal view.

The camera of the 6P was ahead of it's time, especially the ease of use. My previous phones were Galaxies, and these camera apps always had me take 4 or 5 pics before i snapped the right shot, the 6P just made it into a one hit wonder. I also loved the clean Android feel and seeing Android be improved to what it is today was an amazing journey. Google phones i owned:* Nexus 6P* Pixel* Pixel 2 XL (the panda <3)* Pixel 3* Pixel 4* Pixel 3 (again! I loved the size)* Pixel 6 (..)* Pixel 8 (and pixel watch + buds!)My experience with Pixel phones has been outstanding, especially in the beginning. I was a BIG advocate of using Pixels and shilled them a lot. They were a bit hard to come by in Holland at first, so i'd import them. Such great phones though! I bought a Pixel 4 for my Mom that still works to this day! No lag, just smooth as butter. I also loved the google ecosystem and the design language. I still do. I think android has really matured and is in so many ways pushing the envelope in smartphone OS development. I'm trying a *different brand* now but i do miss a lot of the features that android offers. It's so smooth, and navigating the phone is superb. Universal back gesture, now playing, flip to DnD, flick your wrist to reverse to selfie cam; So many nifty ways to interact with your phone, i love it!There has been a \"but\" in this story for me, unfortunately. Ever since the Pixel 6, the road has gotten a bit bumpy for me. The 6 had strange issues, would have excessive battery drain, get really hot, and have software bugs like apps hanging. I loved these phones for the stability and this was getting a bit of an issue. Maybe i was just unlucky?I hoped it was a 6 issue, so i upgraded to the regular 8 + pixel watch 2, and this is were it really got crappy for me on the hardware spectrum. The 8 had a few software issues, like apps hanging when multitasking, that i could live with, but the hardware started failing me, while traveling Japan. First, my Pixel Watch 2 just stopped charging and died on me out of the blue, and a month later, my Pixel 8 started getting a weird green screen issue. tens of times a day the screen would just turn green and spaz out for a minute. Very inconvenient when you're on a Japanese train station trying to figure out where to go. Combine that with google maps hanging a lot when in PIP mode, and it was beginning to become an annoyance to use the P8 on the road.Google support's solution was for them to send the phone in for repair, which would mean i would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks, so i was forced to buy a phone in Japan to travel without hassle. I realised i kinda lost faith in the stability of my pixel because of my 6 and 8 experience, so i decided to \"switch sides\". And i feel a bit sad to leave the Pixels behind to be honest. I genuinely love these phones, i've captured many great memories with em, and they've accompanied me on so many great adventures and never let me down. Until recently.Now, having joined the other side still feels weird. It's a gorgeous device to look at, but i don't think *the other brand* has a better operating system, and in lots of ways i miss my pixel's ease of use. Switching was not that difficult, so i will definitely be back in the future, but i really want Google to deliver a more stable hardware experience first.I feel like i've been a beta tester with these last 2 Pixels. To get a support solution that involves not having my phone for 2 weeks is also very unsatisfactory. (And strange, as my watch WAS able to be exchanged,  but the watch is not really something i can't travel without)I feel like with google's ambitions being upscaled they're also upscaling some of the woes these phones have and it's reflecting on the quality of my experiences.

Therefore I\u2019m a bit hesitant to spend \u20ac900-1000 for a new pixel 9.Instead, I\u2019ve come across some pretty good deals for the pixel 8 which sells around \u20ac500 in my country currently which means I can get 2 pixel 8 for the price of one pixel 9 \ud83d\ude05Now I have read things of lagging screens and screens turning green and purple over time with the 8 and so I\u2019m looking for some advice possibly also from previous iPhone users who have made the switch. Do you think that transitioning from my regular iPhone 13 to Pixel 8 makes sense or should I spend a bit more money and get the pixel 9 instead?Or even more to get the 9 pro?Questions over questions\u2026"},"1209":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL charging surprise hints at a big change in how Google is approaching charging.","self_text":"Playing around with the various Anker chargers I had on hand and a USB-C power meter, I noticed something a bit shocking about the charging of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.When I looked at the charge specs of the 45 watt official charger, I saw that the PPS spec was defined as such.\"PPS: up to 11V\/3A, 16V\/3A, 21V\/2.25A max 45W\"Immediately I noticed that amperage maxed out at 3amps for the various ranges (with less for the 21v).  This was a departure on how Samsung gets 45w output where they keep it at around 11v and up the amperage to 4amps.  This has a side effect of requiring a 5A (emarked) cable for max charge rates. So, I looked at that and thought that Google must be using some voltage higher than 11v to get that 37w.  So, I was assuming they were doing something like 12.3v@3A or maybe possibly 16v@2.3A.  I doubted the later though since that was a pretty high voltage transformation to do in a phone.Well, I tried one of my Anker chargers that did 3.3v-16v@3A and discovered that it topped out at 27w even at a lower battery state.  I tried another and noticed the same.Then I tried my Anker Prime 2700 battery bank which goes up to 21v with PPS and it immediately jumped up to 32w (the battery wasn't fully drained).  What surprised me is that it was 17.9v@1.78a.  Actually, surprised doesn't even cover it, I was gobsmacked.This is pretty unheard of in the mobile world.  Voltage transformation typically generates a lot of heat so the popular approach is to increase amps.  You see it with the Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0 with the 11v@4A output.  You even see it with something like SuperVOOC with OnePlus (80w is 11v@7.3A).This is why I've always felt that manufacturers that wanted to stick to the PD spec were going to run up against a hard ceiling around 55w or so for fast charging these phones since you wouldn't really want to stray beyond 11v.  However, here comes google charging at nearly double the voltage and I'm kinda stunned that no one is talking about it.There's a few significant things about this.  First, there's going to be lower compatibility across existing PPS chargers out there.  Some do go up to 21v, but most of the Anker stuff that's out there tops out at 16v and sometimes 11v.  It seems that if you can't do \\~18v PPS, the P9PXL will top out at 27w essentially doing 9v@3a.  So, that's something to be aware of if you stray from Google's official charger.  It looks like a few of the Ugreen ones go up to 21v so they may work properly.  Companies are really shoddy (Anker, I'm looking at you) about giving all their charging specs so it's likely going to be a bit rough finding 3rd party chargers that go at max rate.Second, I can't think of any reason why Google would be doing this unless they had plans to go BIG with charging down the line and this is the first step.  Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this requires specifically chosen and not so common hardware in the charging circuit design to have a charge pump that does this extreme of a transformation.  There's no real reason to go this route instead of upping the amperage unless you wanted to go beyond the 50w mark in the future as far as I know.  This also highlights Google's heat mitigation for this year's models since the reason why this much voltage transformation is traditionally not done is because it generates heat.I want to point out again that I don't understand why some more technical minded publication hasn't run with this yet.  I'm far from an expert in things like charging, I just know enough to spot something that's an outlier and recognize the general constraints of smaller mobile devices.  I would love for someone who really understands PD design and charging circuits to really dig into this and all the implications.  This was a deliberate choice by Google and it is a very unusual one (and frankly bold for a company that usually plays it safe.)"},"1210":{"post_title":"The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the best phone I\u2019ve ever owned..","self_text":"I\u2019m just a dude in my mid 40s who is very tough on his devices (travel extensively for business, use my phone A LOT for productivity) and has been huge fan of mobile phones for as long as I can remember.  For some context, I\u2019ve owned many iPhones starting with the iPhone 3G, 4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/x\/12pm\/14pm etc as well as many Nokia phones (N8,N9,N95,N97,N97 Mini, Lumia series etc), BlackBerries and of course Android phones (HTCs, Nexus 4,5,6P,Pixel 2XL, Pixel 7P,8P and now 9P XL).This is just an appreciation post for the Pixel 9 Pro\u2026.  While most of my Android phones over the years have been pretty decent, they\u2019ve always struggled in some way or other - whether it be poor battery life, overheating, janky software, poor build quality - you get the idea, but I\u2019ve still always preferred the flexibility of Android over iOS as an operating system.  Today I can confidently say the Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I\u2019ve ever had - it\u2019s absolutely the complete package.  I finally have a phone that has a great battery, stable software, incredible camera and simply just works as advertised.  Not to mention, it\u2019s doing all of this for a great value imo.  I haven\u2019t been this smitten with a phone since the Nokia N9 (if you know, you know)When I look at the shit show that is iOS 18 right now and the laughably stale iPhone 16 PM (not to mentioned ridiculously overpriced) with hacked together AI features (and tragedy of a photos app) - I feel like Google is finally prepared to make a serious dent in the mobile space.Wishing you all a happy holiday season! "},"1211":{"post_title":"What are some things you didnt know your Google Pixel could do?","self_text":"**What are some interesting things you learned you can do only on your Pixel?**  For example:1. When using the Google Assistant call screening feature you can lift the phone to your ear to listen to the caller without answering the phone. Its a great way to recognize someones voice if you dont recognize the number. You can also press the volume buttons to hear the audio on speakerphone too.2. When calling a business directory, the Google Assistant will print out all of the extension options on your screen so you dont have to write anything down or call the directory again in case you missed the extension or did not remember what each extension does3. If you never see any spam calls or junk texts on your pixel phone that means its **working properly**. You can actually see the complete activity of all the dismissed phone calls that never went through the google assistant. *On avg with iphone and samsung i see 10+ per week of malicious activity.*4. If you flip your phone screen down first it will silence phone calls and notifications. So at work or school you can  charge your phone and flip it over without having to toggle volumes. Another neat trick actually is the ability to change the status of your phone based on wifi\/locations. *If you are at work or school as soon as your phone connects it silences and you never have to take it out.*5. You can snooze notifications to be reminded later if you dont want to dismiss or attend to a notification immediately. Also if you have a habit of clearing notifications, the Notification History can show which important notification you missed!6. \u00a0 Instead of double-click a word and then used the cursors\u00a0to highlight text. You can actually just press and hold and swipe in a single sweeping move to select more text. The spacebar on the Gboard can similarly be used to control the cursor when typing, and makes fixing typos super fast.7. You can use your phone as a passthrough webcam (best with stand) for quick meetings from your desktop if you dont have a dedicated camera. You can also use the google pixel recorder app to record and transcribe every meeting!8. In the messages app you can delete OTPs after 24 hours. (one time passwords sent for verification codes, 2FA). Also OTP verification codes, 2FA are automatically filled into your app\/website for you! **So you never need to go to your messages app to retrieve a code.**9. *Practically every Pixel feature works offline*: including the Now Playing song listening feature (like Shazam). It recognizes every song and saves it in a history. Any cafe, club, or movie you attend will have a recommendation playlist to revisit.10. Guest Mode at a tap can be enabled to share your work phone with friends or children without worry that any accidental changes or privacy issues. This is also great if you have to lend a backup phone as well. OR more discreetly you can just use **App Pinning** feature to only give access to a specific app when lending your phone11. Alarms have a soft-wake sound, gradually it gets louder so its not waking the entire house. Also you can just say STOP or SNOOZE if its too far away to turn off12. If you want to try **Active Edge** there is an app in the Play Store that returns this function to your phone if your new Google Pixel doesnt have it anymore. Squeezing the phone can trigger Google Assistant or Gemini instead of asking, \"Hey Google\".13. **Planned Obsolescence** doesnt matter with old google pixel phones thanks to lineageOS if you wish to you can continue to receive updates long after the 5-7years of software updates from Google."},"1212":{"post_title":"All this Tensor hate is really annoying","self_text":"First of all, this is just my personal opinion.

In fact, the Tensor G4 also offers flagship power and performance, and I'm pretty sure it won't have any problems with the 8-year update guarantee.In everyday use, Pixel phones with Tensor SoC run at least as smoothly as an iPhone or a flagship phone with a Snapdragon SoC. You will only notice a difference in specific use cases, for example when rendering a video. But is it really a big deal if your video does take a few seconds longer to render?In my opinion, Google is on the right track with its Tensor SoCs and much of the hate is unfounded.As I said, this is just my personal opinion.Thanks for reading - guess I'll take my down votes now - a happy Pixel 9 user."},"1213":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 series price increase would've been better received if they had bumped up the base storage to 256 GB","self_text":"A lot of people seem unhappy about the price increases of the Pixel 9 phones, and rightfully so.

"},"1218":{"post_title":"After 14 Years of iPhone, I Finally Switched to Android: My One-Month Review of the Pixel 9","self_text":"Last month, after being a loyal iPhone user for 14 years, I decided to switch to Android and join the Pixel family. Now that I\u2019ve spent a month with the Pixel 9, here\u2019s my honest take.First off, I love it. The Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. Its design and in-hand feel are incredible, and the software, UI, and customization options are amazing. That said, it did take me a couple of weeks to fully get used to it. Of course, the phone isn\u2019t perfect, and there are some things I miss about the iOS experience. But overall, I\u2019m very happy with the switch. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the pros and cons:**Pros:**1. **Android as an OS is incredible.** The customization, adaptability, and overall experience are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. I thought it would take me longer to adjust, but it didn\u2019t. Compared to Android, iOS feels incredibly restrictive and even convoluted for the simplest tasks. Everyday actions like making calls, using notes, managing photos, or typing on the keyboard are streamlined and feel faster on Android.2. **The camera is phenomenal.** It takes beautiful photos without weird colors, is fast, and feels hassle-free. The AI features, especially \"Add Me,\" are super useful\u2014I use it all the time, and it always looks great. While I\u2019ve heard some complaints about video recording on the Pixel 9, I haven\u2019t recorded anything yet, so I can\u2019t really comment on that.3. **Battery life is impressive.** With regular use (12+ hours), 120Hz refresh rate, and no battery-saving mode activated, the phone easily lasts all day. It\u2019s never gotten hot or even warm. I know some people have issues with battery and overheating, but I haven\u2019t experienced any of that.4. **AI features are actually useful.** From call screening to live transcription and photo editing tools, the Pixel\u2019s AI features are genuinely practical. I\u2019ve used most of them daily, and they\u2019ve made my life easier in ways I didn\u2019t expect.**Cons:**1. **Some iOS features still haunt me.** After a long time with iOS, there are things I miss, even if they\u2019re minor. For example, the ability to have both lock screen widgets and stackable widgets on iOS is so practical. It gives you more information at a glance. While Android has alternatives with launchers, I (like many people) don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of setting them up.2. **The clock app could be better.** I\u2019m not a fan of the alarm system or the overall customization of the clock app on the Pixel. Sleep mode, in particular, feels a little funky to me\u2014it could use some improvements.3. **QuickShare is no AirDrop.** This one hurts the most. The ease and reliability of AirDrop are hard to beat, and QuickShare feels like a clunky substitute. The few times I\u2019ve tried using it, it either didn\u2019t work or was slower than simply sending things via text.**Final Thoughts:**Despite these small issues, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. I love it and don\u2019t regret making the switch from iOS at all. For anyone thinking about changing, I\u2019d fully recommend it.**TL;DR:**  After 14 years of using iPhone, I switched to the Pixel 9. I love the customization, incredible camera, and battery life, plus the useful AI features. I miss iOS widgets, AirDrop, and the clock app, but overall, the Pixel 9 is the best phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I highly recommend the switch!"},"1219":{"post_title":"I just held the Pixel 9 Pro in-hand at Best Buy","self_text":"What a great feeling device in the hand. All the sharp corners of my Pixel 8 are gone. The screen and side rails just morph into one another. This is in contrast with my Pixel 8 which I\u2019ve always felt has a bit harsh of an edge around the front screen. This is easily the most premium feeling Pixel device I\u2019ve held to date. The color on display was Hazel which looked very, very nice. The XL model was in Obsidian. Also a looker. No regular Pixel 9 on display.I\u2019ve seen some reviewers comment on how thick the camera bar is. I don\u2019t share the same sentiment. It looks as big as the promo photos make it look, no bigger. When I turned the phone over to see the camera, I went, \u201cYep, that looks about like what I expected.\u201d Nothing more. Something that stuck out to me was how smooth the interface felt. It could just be that \u201cnew device feel,\u201d so I\u2019m curious to see if others notice the same thing. But navigating the system apps felt very fluid. Of course, after about 60 seconds I had a, \u201cWell, what now?\u201d moment. All of you who have used retail units understand what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s really nothing you can do to put a retail unit through your own real-world use cases. All I did was bounce around the system apps and then did some web browsing. I did notice some stuttering while web browsing, but I\u2019m hesitant to draw any conclusions for three reasons: 1) All phones have some micro-stutter on web pages, including iPhones, 2) This phone was in retail mode, and retail mode wrecks havoc on these devices, and 3) Android 15 claims to remedy this issue, and this device was running Android 14. So do NOT read into this any more than surface level. I can confirm Froggy is alive if tapping the weather widget on the home screen. But he is NOT present in the new, dedicated weather app. I do think Google is competing with the big boys now in terms of industrial design. This phone is a looker, no doubt. I didn\u2019t do a very deep dive and I\u2019m out of the store now, so I\u2019m not sure how many questions I could answer.

I had to resort to the tech illiterate method of taking photos of the screens. I took these photos on of the Pixel 9 Pro XL screen to try to compare photo quality with my 8 Pro.---------------------First, I cannot believe no one's mentioned this so far. Anyone looking at cameras should be able to notice the difference with ease here.As a background, my usual photo test is 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 30x, and then I look at 100% crops to compare. After I took the photos, I scrolled back and starting with the 30x, I was already in shock. The difference was astounding. I didn't even need to 100% crop.Before I go to the telephoto, let's consider the environment. Best Buy Store. This is what a [1x FOV looks like](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AC15ML9.jpeg) (P8P)Now let's look at the [30x on the 9 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EEcb3Za.jpeg), I was amazed this was even a 30x. Now maybe I thought the text was large and simple to capture, so I tried taking another photo. Yup. Just as sharp. I looked at my [Pixel 8 Pro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WNAQikk.jpeg). All that noise? Yeah, that's usually how 30x is. I don't consider it that usable. Considering you're looking at a photo of the screen on the 9 Pro, you can already imagine the real image being much cleaner than that.I thought maybe the 30x zoom was doing some overly AI magic stuff even though I didn't touch Zoom Enhance so I looked at 5x photos and those were already great on the 9 Pro (sorry no comparison available because I may have mixed up my 5x and 10x photos). I then went over to shoot down another aisle. I figured the earlier comparison was unfair because text is easy to optimize for and so [let's look at this comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zA3cQ5k.jpeg). The Pixel 8 Pro is again noisy like I'm used to, but man that 9 Pro cleans up the photo so well. I can actually read the words \"Wired Keyboard.\" For those of you who want the image pulled out of the camera of the P8P, [here it is](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wrJAOT2.jpeg). It's really that bad.And in my last test I shot [straight on at the products in an aisle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Kb6Dei2.jpeg).

Again, here's the [full 8 Pro image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/utljI74.jpeg) for you to see how noisy 30x is.**Bottom line is this telephoto sensor upgrade is huge**. There's too many people who were pessimistic in saying that the same sensor size, same aperture = no likely improvement, but this new sensor is clearly 3 years newer than the older Samsung GM5.-------------**Edit**: Add a [5x optical comparison and 30x comparison](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hAXJhbY.jpeg). Apologies for the screen photos but this was taken on an iPhone to compare the 8Pro and 9Pro outputs.

Naked screen.I like this, just nervous that it might scratch and that's the only reason I'd want a screen protector Things is, is it even necessary anymore as the glass improves for each phone generation?I posted this question on the Google Pixel comm on FB for each Pixel release but apparently Google doesn't like to approve the question, so I'm gonna ask here where there isn't ridiculous heavy handed moderation for a perfectly logical question about maintaining the longevity and integrity of the device: is there anyone who is going renegade and not using a screen protector? How has it been? Or does everyone here use some kind of protector? (I'm particular to film and not tempered glass and that's just harder to find too. So far I found ONE single company for the 9 and it was a terrible experience compared to all my other 4 Pixels even though the application concept was the same. Pretty sure they were manufactured backwards)I normally skip every other year (this is my first odd numbered pixel) btw but this was a lucky score and I have to say, the 9 seems to be a much smoother experience than the 8. It's only been about 24 hours though. It is true when ppl say this feels premium. It's a different animal. But if attacked by another animal, will the screen hold up? Talk to me about your experiences please, I'm ready to drop the protectors if there is reasonable confidence it's not necessary. (Note: i don't carry keys bc my locks are smart locks so that may help my decision making. Keys were always the culprit beforehand.)"},"1228":{"post_title":"Bluetooth connection issues since the December 2024 Android 15 update.","self_text":"So both my wifes Mazda 3 2012 and my Mazda 6 2011 are having bluetooth connection issues.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about Pixels at the time, but I loved the panda theme and photos of that phone, so I decided my next phone would be the next Pixel released. I bought the Pixel 3 at launch, and despite some obvious issues - lack of ram being one - I really enjoyed that phone. The photos looked amazing, and little things like squeeze for assistant were so cool. I didn\u2019t need to upgrade when the Pixel 4 came out, and the reported battery issues put me off, but I absolutely adored the aesthetic. It looked like a paradigm Google device. When the Pixel 5 released, I was due to upgrade, and despite it not being the best value at launch, it was exactly what I wanted. I absolutely loved that phone. The size, the hand feel, the rear fingerprint sensor - everything was great. It wasn\u2019t the most powerful at the time, but it did everything I wanted in a phone, and still had the Pixel charm.  I\u2019ve had the Pixel 6, 7, and 8, but I don\u2019t want to make this post too long. With the current Pixel offerings, it just doesn\u2019t feel as \u201cPixel\u201d to me. I\u2019m not bashing the phones at all. They\u2019re probably the best they\u2019ve been by many accounts, but they just don\u2019t appeal to me as much now. The hardware is great, but the look and feel is so different from the early iterations, and it seems to lack that charm, and what I consider to be the Pixel \u201cidentity\u201d. They used to be a firmly mid-range phone that was snappy to use and had amazing cameras. It felt like you were getting a great deal that was something unique to Google devices.So, my question is, what is it that made you choose Pixel? Are you someone who has had Pixels in the past and still loves the current Pixels? Or have you not had one previously, but the newest versions have drawn you in? Are you like me, where you miss what we had?Edit: Not sure why I titled it this way. Probably should have been something like \u2018What Do You Value in a Pixel\u2019 or something.

I rocked the 8 for quite some time, and I did just trade it in for a 9 Pro, and it's really nice that Google has stepped up with 7+ years of support now.But IMHO the Pixel 5 is the best Pixel of all time for various reasons- size, weight, non-existent bump, decent cpu even today, and it pains me that Google refuses to push security updates to it anymore. This is a device that could be used for at least 1-2 more years with no issues.Anyway. That is all. \/rEdit: the difference between the Pixel 5 and all the other old unsupported devices you compare it to is that, the Pixel 5 is still a fine device that is now obsolete by design, not because it's too slow or broken. Yes we could still support an iPhone 6, but have you tried using one? It's so slow you can't really use it. Forced obsolescence is what pisses me off. Yes, I knew it from the beginning. That does not make it ok. "},"1232":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is Amazing!","self_text":"I just gotta come here and express my gratitude towards Google for actually fixing and changing the many issues with their previous devices. To preface, I've been a long time iPhone user who dabbles with the android ecosystem. I used to flip-flop back and forth each year between Apple and Google up until the Pixel 4, but then I felt like googles devices couldn't keep up with some of the hardware Apple uses on their devices. Most recently I really tried to love the P8P but there was so many issues I couldn't see past that would degrade the experience of the device. As with my job, I can't really be near a charger at all times, one of my main issues was the terrible battery life of the Pixel 8 Pro. I wouldn't even make it through an 8-10 hour shift comfortably with the Pixel 8 Pro. And it wasn't solely for screen on time, but mainly standby time that was the culprit. Of course screen time would degrade my battery life even quicker, but as it was in my pocket for a few hours and I'd go back onto my phone seeing that it lost 15+ percent battery life was extremely unsettling. I'd constantly limit background usage, turn 5G off an use LTE strictly, turn off location services. And although that helped slightly, I don't believe you should limit your phone in a bunch of different ways to be able to prolong battery life.I always also experienced lagging\/stuttering issues with the 8 Pro. This issue is self explanatory and not much to say other than it seriously degraded the experience of using the phone.Overheating... Yeah that was an issue constantly. I'd be using maps on my car and my phone would have an overheating warning. In direct sunlight, I'd have an overheating warning. Etc. it was just a constant battle. The modem on the 8 Pro was AWFUL. Such spotty service, dropped calls, and again, limiting to LTE instead of 5G just to have improvements on the battery life. Now with the P9PXL, oh my what a drastic difference. And of course this is my experience with the device, but battery has been amazing. The standby times have been excellent, no need to limit background usage, limit to LTE, turn down screen resolution. Yesterday I had over 4 hours SOT and the device was still at 50 ish percent battery life by the time I got home. I was using the camera, maps, daily texting, phone calls, emails, social media and this device just handled it so well. The modem is crazy good. I'd argue better than apples. I live in the basement of my house and on either the 8 Pro or 15 Pro Max, I'd get one bar or no bars in my room. P9PXL is sitting at 3 bars right now in a room I struggled to have service in. Haven't experienced a single dropped call, using 5G and this modem is killing it all!Overheating hasn't been an issue at all. This phone remains cool with my usage patterns because of that new vapor chamber. Haven't had a single overheating issue whether using android auto, or just being outside on my device.Stuttering hasn't been an issue at all. The UI has been buttery smooth. No hiccups or stuttering. The new fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. I'm using a tempered glass screen protector and it just reads my fingerprint without delay. Messing around with the add me feature on the camera and the magic eraser, it's just crazy what AI on a device can do. Some of the features are a gimmick in my opinion, but some of these features are seriously QOL features. With RCS finally available on iPhone (well currently to those who have the iOS 18 beta) texting between iPhone and Android has been lovely with those read receipts, reply features, no horribly compressed photos\/videos. I say this with full confidence, but I genuinely feel like this is finally a Pixel year for me. I'm seriously loving everything about this phone.

It was **still ringing**! Somehow, it seems to have survived the fall\u2026 or at least part of it.Now here\u2019s the kicker: the lift maintenance company said retrieving it during the weekend would be super expensive.

Part 1: Why Pixel Outshines iPhone","self_text":"As an iPhone user who recently switched to Pixel, I've noticed several areas where Pixel excels. Here's my breakdown:\u00a0\\*\\* Edit: Part 2 is now in the same post at the bottom. due to community rules.# 1. Advanced Notification System* Comprehensive view of downloaded files downloaded apps and, current playback in the notification center.* notifications symbols at the status bar are very useful* Intuitive notification management (e.g., disabling specific notifications and keeping other notifications for the same app)\u00a0# 2. Clear Interactive System Information* Detailed charging speed indicators when you charge  your phone.* Alarm volume feedback, when you miss an alarm, it shows you that volume of your alarm is low.* Reminder to close Incognito pages, after finishing from chrome if you still have incognito pages on.\u00a0# 3. Robust File Management* PC-like file system with enhanced filtering. All your documents from whatever app you use, you will find it in the documents tap. Same for images. It\u2019s universal same as the PC.* Because files controls all, It\u2019s better cleaning of cluttering files\u00a0# 4. Enhanced User Interface* Google search bar on home screen, and still the widgets on Android are more helpful than iOS. Maybe because it\u2019s older feature, so It\u2019s much adopted.* You can customize how many apps you want to add in a single row.* News feed on left swipe is very handy feature and I\u2019m addicted to it right now.* Speech to text is much more reliable than iPhone in languages especially for non-native English speakers.\u00a0# 5. Multimedia and Connectivity* More practical Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality* Superior web chrome casting than iPhone airplay, especially for web pages and not so popular website. Specially in background continuity of the casting.* You can still feel the Android multitasking is more serious than one in iOS. Specially if you are downloading or loading one file from the internet.\u00a0# 6. Communication Features* Full call history logs (Easy one here iPhone !!)\u00a0# 7. Customization and Productivity* Clipboard feature in Gboard is game changing feature. Specially you can pin you copies for ever.* The share option on Pixel for anything you select is really handy compared to iPhone.* Option to add number rows in certain forms where you need it. In this way you will have bigger windows, but at the same time you will have number rows in for example forms for easy filling.* Auto fill in Pixel is nearly the same as it\u2019s on chrome browser on windows. It\u2019s fast, accurate and never disappoint you. Unlike other auto filling features where you have to press many buttons.\u00a0# 8. App Availability* I don\u2019t why but Android in general have collection of not well-known apps that are really handy unlike the iPhone where the popular apps are one you have to use. For example, in Android in IPTV 9stream. You cannot find similar app on iPhone.* Downloading apps from outside the Play store, gives you the freedom you have on windows.\u00a0# 9. Device Analysis* Apps for monitoring device condition Like Accu battery, Amp and system UI tweaker are all example of how some apps can have an advanced control which you provide you with really good insights.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Part 2: why iOS in some parts outperform Android (Pixel)Now the 2nd part where some features in iOS and iPhone really outperform the one in Android Pixel.# 1- Better Face Unlock:iOS's Face ID is still the best in class. Still I have issues with the optical fingerprint here in Pixel and the face ID is not that secure. For example it cannot verify your wallet payment.# 2- Unified Call History:Having all the recent calls from all the apps in one place is important. I know some users hate this feature, but maybe because I was an iPhone user since long time. For me this feature was really helpful in making calls  so fast especially at work.# 3- Spotlight Search:Spotlight search is the Feature No. 1 that I wish android has. One swipe down and you get a search bar with automatically keyboard on  and then you can get and find  whatever you want in your device, even files, documents, photos. For example: if you swipe down and type passport. iOS will give you the passport document in Files app, in addition to the Passport screenshots\/ photos in your Photos app.# 4- Text Cursor Control:Hold space to move the cursor, making text editing easier. Better than the one in Gboard.# 5- Privacy in Tracking:Better control and transparency over app tracking.# 6- VPN in Safari:Built-in VPN support, while Google One's VPN isn't available in my country.# 7-Best-in-Class Accessories:Air Pods pro and Apple TV have very well integration with iPhone.  For example If I wear the AirPods while I'm watching Youtube in the Apple TV. notification will appear to press only one button on Apple remote to connect the AirPods to apple TV. Then I got a call in iPhone it automatically transfer the AirPods pro to iPhone. neat feature.Also you can find your Apple  remote precise location from iPhone# 8- Note SearchingOne extra point for Spot search is that you  can search through notes directly from Spotlight.# 9-CarPlay StabilityAlthough Android Auto is more advanced system than Apple Carplay. Carplay is far more stable and reliable. I was using my wireless Carplay in my Toyota Prado, and I never having it disconnected from the car. In Android, two three times a week# 10-Touch Screen QualityI don't why I always feel the touchscreen quality of Phone is superior the one in Pixel. It's more accurate and shorter response time.# 11- Universal iCloud Document in all Apple devices:This is an important point. Document folder in iOS (iCloud) is the same on all Apple devices. So without uploading or backing up files. If you save any file from any Apple device in Documents folder you will have it in all of your Apple device# 12-Comfortable KeyboardDespite lacking some Android features like number rows and clipboard, the iPhone keyboard is more comfortable to use and snappier also# 13- Stable and Polished Apps:Android has made good leap on this part, but still iOS apps are more stable and polished compared to their Android counterparts.# 14-iMessage and Facetime:For me Facetime is really handy, iMessage are major for the users in US. For us here we use WhatsApp mainly.we reach the end.\\*\\* I hope  it\u2019s helpful for people who are searching for pros and cons."},"1239":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - modem experience","self_text":"Because its a topic of high interest i wanted to give my experience with the new modem in the Pixel 9 Pro XL in comprasion to the 8 Pro.

While doing this job i drive around for a local drinks market and deliver water and other stuff to customers in the area. While i do this job i have multiple things running:- navigation with google maps- bluetooth audio to the car all the time- some calls (bluetooth as well) , maybe 5 min per hour work- an app to warn me for dangers on the road- everything while using 5G\/ mobile network all the time with lots of switching cell towers because of the driving- sunny day, so max brightness often\/ almost all the time- smartwatch connected all the time as well with navigation steps showing there as well- no charging opportunities(- i set up the phone without a backup so it might or might not still learn usage patterns)Considering this is basically as heavy as it gets for the modem my 8 Pro was definitely struggling. It got hot and sometimes was slow loading while doing all this. The battery was basically getting fried and after app. 5h of work the phone dropped from 100% to at best 35%. When it was a longer tour it could get as low as 15% at the 6h mark which was definitely annoying.Comparing this with the 9 Pro XL today and the difference really is night and day. I had zero lags, the phone got barely warm and all that while being more consistent with cell reception and screen brightness. I live in a bigger city in germany so i get 5G most of the time anyways but the 9 Pro didnt have any of the drops in speed i had with the 8 Pro. And if all that wasnt brilliant enough already i finished a 4,5h tour with 65% of battery. At this point the 8 Pro would have been at 40% i guess. So all in all im very impressed and i dont think the modem should be something anyone consider a negative point about the phone. A Snapdragon modem maybe is still be better overall (no idea how i would notice), but if a modem can take this amount of abuse i really cant blame it especially if the whole user experience is such a blast.If you have further questions feel free to ask, trying my best to answer it."},"1240":{"post_title":"120hz Scroll stutter is still pathetic on the Pixel 8","self_text":"# EDIT: The Android 15 update has improved scrolling a lot, apps like Messages, Playstore and Spotify are noticeably smoother.

Hopefully this post will save somebody else from going through the same trouble. Spoiler alert. None of them work perfectly. ... One of them is good enough though.Mous super thin case- Will not charge properly magnet. Definitely misaligned pretty close but not quite right.  Works with ESR charger. Power cycles on everything else will not charge properly. Will wake up with dead battery on occasion even on the ESR charger. So sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't. Sad because this was my favorite caseDbrand grip - works with ESR charger but not with unitech cooling charger and not with Mophie power bank.  I liked this case but that's a deal-breaker JIC airguard case -  charges great on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger. Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right but very close.  This one has a clear back so you can see the magnetic ring.  Personally, I don't really like that look but to each their own.    However, this one charged the best out of everything so this is my go-toTUDIA MergeGrip - mixed results does not work at all with the Mophie power bank and the ESR and unitec seems to charge properly about 75% of the time but sometimes will not charge. This case is more bulky than the torras case, thus being more protective.  I like the way it feels in hand and it's cheap.  ,Ringke Onyx - Nice feeling. Case has a nice protective edge on the camera and the front.  Comfortable to hold.  Putting on the ESR charger. It charges fine but I did notice a few times overnight, i wouldn't get a full charge when I woke up. On the unitech charger it was hit or miss. Sometimes it would charge. Sometimes it would just keep trying to reconnect and not charge.  On the Mophie power bank will not charge at all.  TORRAS Magnetic Shockproof case translucent back-  looks like the jic case , However, I will say the magnet is probably a little better in the Torras.  charges mostly ok on ESR charger and unitek cooling charger.(Sometimes it does not make a proper connection still) Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  So it's not quite right. This was actually the one that I rated the best for the pixel 8 pro, However, with the pixel 8 pro I was able to use my Mophie power bank.  Very disappointed that I can't with this one.  This is the one that I wanted to work the best....  Oh well I guess they can't make them all rightMous for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case MagSafe Compatible Limitless 5.0- Carbon Fibre - unsurprisingly, the results were exactly the same as the other mous case.  See \ud83d\ude00above for details. This one is thicker. Better drop protection TORRAS Magnetic & Stand for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case Clear -   charges great on ESR charger and will not charge properly on the unitek charger.  Still doesn't work properly on the Mophie power bank.  Strange because my results with this one are different than the other torras case. Apparently they did not make the magnet and the exact same place between the two cases.    So it'll work on one charger only and who knows if it'll actually stay fully charged overnight or if it'll disconnect at some point. I would not buy this one. Disappointed cuz I wanted the kickstand but oh well. I can just a magnetic popsocket instead. Ruky for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with Privacy Screen Protector - this one feels bulky to me, but it does have nice rounded edges. Nothing that digs into your fingers when you're holding it. Very rubbery. Oddly, when on the ESR charger this one keeps disconnecting.  Every other case so far charges on the ESR.  When put on the unit unitek charger, However, it seems to charge okay, no power cycling. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank. I suppose if you want to just buy a cooling unitek magsafe charger then it would work. Problem is is they don't make one for your nightstand and that particular charger lights up all kinds of colors when charging so I do not recommend it for a nightstand.  Because of this reason I wouldn't buy this one.  On the plus side though, it does come with a screen protector (personally, however, I recommend going to Best buy and getting their screen protectors because they come with a lifetime warranty, Free replacements done by The geek squad if you live near a Best buy) Poetic Guardian MagPro Case - this one seems to charge properly at first on the unitech and ESR but eventually starts power cycling and not charging properly. Does not work at all with the Mophie power bank.  I would not recommend this case. On the flip side, this is probably the most protective case out of all the ones that I am reviewing Nillkin for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Magnetic Case - first thoughts is while I like the case, it does feel quite slippery feels like I could accidentally drop my phone with this on it. With the ESR stand seemed to charge okay. However, with the unitek charger, I saw some strange results which I hadn't seen from any other cases.  This one would show that it's charging and not indicate that it's disconnecting but I used ampere to check charging speeds on every one of these cases and even though it showed that it was charging, it was actually discharging the phone.  Because of this, I think it's very likely that you would or put your phone on a charger overnight and wake up in the morning with a 20% battery.   I think it's not far enough off on alignment for it to totally disconnect, but it is far enough for it to not make a good connection and continue charging.  Does not work at all with the Mophie. I don't recommend this one at allRenmou Magnetic for Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case - I actually really like the way this one feels in the hand. Hard to explain. Feels very smooth but not slippery just feels great in hand. Cutouts at the bottom do not have very sharp edges. If you tend to keep your pinky under your phone, it's not going to dig into it.  Sadly, this one power cycles connecting, disconnecting on all three chargers.  No good pitaka for Pixel 9 Pro XL Case, Slim & Light Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Case with a Case-Less Touch Feeling, 600D Aramid Fiber Made, Black\/Grey(Twill) - this case, while being quite beautiful probably wouldn't protect your screen at all. Does not add buttons to the side. Rather it's just got to cut out so you can access the actual buttons. It does however have a protector edge on the camera bump. On the screen at the front, however, my screen protector actually protrudes out more than the case itself. So my screen protector would be the first thing to hit if I dropped it.  If you're just trying to add magsafe and no protection other than the back of the phone. I guess this would work. This one doesn't charge properly on the Mophie or the ESR charger.  On the unitek charger, it's hit or miss most of the time seems to charge fine. Every once in awhile won't work properly. If you just want the fastest, easiest result buy the JIC airguard case!  If you're already out of your room, there isn't an actual case that works properly with everything sadly.  I had the pixel 8 pro and with the Torras case on it everything worked including the Mophie magsafe battery pack.  After buying 13 cases I'm done trying and this is the one I'm going to stick with.  It's ridiculous that they can't get them right, but at least this will save you a little time trying everything.  Honestly the power bank being magsafe is kind of useless anyhow. drains the battery pack so fast and barely get a charge out of it. Better off using one with a cable and plugging it straight in for a fast, quick charge.   It was really not a big deal for it to not work honestly."},"1242":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro, from an iPhone user","self_text":"I would regard myself as a tech guy. My phone plan allowed me to switch to a new phone as often as I want. I have tried alot of android brands: OnePlus, Samsung, Moto, previous Pixel phones. Each time, I found myself switching back to the iPhone due to various reasons, including app optimization, camera quality, audio quality, software, etc. I just felt like iPhone was the most well rounded phone. Having switched to the Pixel 9 Pro, I genuinely feel like google hit the mark with this phone.- Camera quality is seriously amazing. Friends and family will literally ask me to take pictures for them after seeing pictures I've previously taken. - Problems I've had with previous generations of Pixel phones have been directly addressed, including cell reception problems, audio sounding tinny, fingerprint scanner being slow. - The AI features have been tossed around as \"gimmicky\", but I genuinely use them so much. For instance, I've been wanting to try more foods, so I'll literally ask Gemini to create me a spicy Indian dish with chicken, and add all ingredients to my list along with instructions on how to cook and it'll do it effortlessly. Using the AI Live feature as job interview prep has been amazing; It'll ask me questions and rate my responses. I actually used \"Add me\" on a family trip this weekend, and it worked effortlessly.- App optimization seems to have improved. I use Snapchat and Instagram stories alot, and the camera is great on there as well. (Although iphone is definitely better)- I feel like there's finally an established ecosystem. The watch is much improved with the addition of a bigger size. I've had the buds 3 for about a week and they've been nothing but great.- Although not directly related to Google, RCS becoming more mainstream has made messaging iPhone users significantly better.  If you're on the fence on switching - I'd suggest on doing so. I have a feeling you're worried about missing iMessage, FaceTime and the camera quality. But the new additions have not made me thing about this once.  I've had this phone for a month and have loved every bit - I actually went full send and purchased the watch as well as the buds. Full ecosystem! If you have any questions about the switch, let me know!

The camera on the Pixel 9 Pro XL is simply outstanding. It consistently delivers sharper, more vibrant photos, and the AI enhancements make every shot look professional.Beyond the camera, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is incredibly fun to use. The interface is smooth and intuitive, and the integration of Google's smart features adds a layer of convenience that I didn't realize I was missing. Overall, the switch has been a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the Pixel 9 Pro XL to anyone looking for a superior camera and a more enjoyable smartphone

Here are my observations so far","self_text":"I've had the Pixel 4a for around 3 years; got it in 2021. Very happy with it. I upgraded to it from the OG Pixel and it was an improvement in every area. Despite being very happy with the 4a, I was still mulling over an upgrade to the Pixel 8 now that its price is a bit more sensible, but all the UI stuttering issues deterred me from it. Recently there was a sale for the Pixel 8a; I decided to go for that instead. Here are my observations so far: **THIS PHONE IS BIG!** [\"On paper\"](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Hzp3HbI.png) the 4a and the 8a did not look all that different in size. The 8a is bigger, but it is not considered to be a [big phone](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mdAphoE.png) nowadays. In reality, there is a very noticeable size difference. The 8a feels huge! Not only is it noticeably taller and wider, but it is tangibly heavier too. This phone is HEAVY! My 4a in its case is 184g, and the 8a is 237g. You can feel those 53 grams. They were not stingy with the bezels on the 8a either. Bezels galore! It really does not bother me much except that it adds to the overall size. This is not a one handed use phone, at least not comfortably. **THIS PHONE IS SMOOTH!** If you don't know, the Pixel 8 has issues with stuttering when scrolling, you can Google it, there are plenty of reports from users. I myself have tried several Pixel 8s and they all noticeably stuttered at 120Hz (Side note: Pixel 9 also stutters. 9 Pro \/ 9 Pro XL are smooth). And even though Google states that they fixed it in Android 15, it is in fact, not fixed. I had the same expectation for the 8a only to be pleasantly surprised to find out that the 8a is smooth. It is incredibly smooth. This is how 120Hz should look, and feel. Once you try out the 120Hz mode, 60Hz looks terrible. I never had any complaints about the 4a and thought it was perfectly smooth, but going back to it after the 8a at 120Hz, the downgrade is immediately noticeable. I only noticed stuttering with 9gag, the app stutters in any mode, but with the 8 I would notice stuttering when pulling down a notification shade, or going into settings. It had micro stuttering even when scrolling the settings. The screen is great! **THE BACK MOUNTED FINGER PRINT SENSOR, HOW I LAMENT THOU**The 4a has a back mounted finger print sensor. It was a Pixel line signature feature. Super convenient and worked reliably. Unfortunately the 8a does not have that anymore. I am already having issues with reliable unlocking with the under the screen finger print sensor on the 8a.UPDATE: It is awful and unusable. Unlocking this phone would not be convenient if it had not had face unlock. **BATTERY** The 8a is new so the battery life is great. But in general as far as I know it is considered to be one of the phones with a great battery life. I've had two 4a Pixels, the first one had decent battery life, the second one though drains very quickly for some reason. I have to charge it several times a day, so a better battery is very welcome. Charging is slow on the 8a, but to me it really does not matter. The 4a charged slowly too, and it did not bother me much. After trying it a bit more, the 8a is better than the 4a, but it is not as great as I thought it would be. Not a full day battery life phone, you will need to change it at least once throughout the day. Here is an example of the battery drain overnight. [Started with 80% battery](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/MxzkX26p\/IMG-20241210-000007.jpg) [Dropped to 67% overnight](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/ZZHGd7nF\/IMG-20241210-100123.jpg) The conditions here: Connectivity through LTE, all the apps closed, the screen was off the whole time. I missed the alarm, maybe that took one or two percent. If we account for that, it is 11-12% drop overnight. **A FLAGSHIP SOC? WHO NEEDS IT** I never had any complaints with the 4a's speed, and I consider myself to be a power user with the exception that I don't play games. The 8a only improves on that as it has a newer SoC. To be honest though, I don't notice the difference in speed between the 4a and the 8a. Both open apps, browse and do other things fast enough where I never register slowness. Tensor 3 is a relatively weak SoC too, I have no idea what would somebody need to do to fully utilise a Snapdragon 8 Elite. **THE RAM** The 4a has 6GB of RAM, the 8a has 8GB of RAM. Have I noticed any improvements in day-to-day use? Absolutely not. Both kick apps out of RAM and refresh them the same way. I feel you could give Android 80GB of RAM and it would still be refreshing and kicking apps out of the memory.**THE ROBOT** I was stuck on Android 13 with the 4a. I checked on Android 14 and Android 15 and there really were not that many nice new features in them. I don't care if a feature is big or small, I only care about how useful it is. For example, manual rotation icon is a relatively small feature, but I love it! It make a big difference for me. The 8a came with Android 14. I used it for a bit and then upgraded to Android 15. There are some good features like: * Circle-to-search is cool - Although, I thought I'd be using it all the time, I haven't used it once so far* Private space is nice - A good feature to have. Haven't had the need for it yet* I like the new back icon, its animation, how it snaps off from the edge * Predictive back gesture animation is great - I think if this animation is used, then the above back icon animation is unnecessary. Right now, it's the two of them at once* Pin auto-confirm is good to have; very handy with the new finger print sensor - I've used this quite a bit out of necessity because the under the screen FPS isn't great* USB-C to monitor video streaming is good - Haven't used it yet * There is partial screen recording - Haven't had the need for it yet, but good to have* The December Pixel Drop for Android 15 added 80% charge limit - I like that feature and I use itThere is new some customisation options (which I don't really use), but overall, I don't feel like I was missing out with Android 13 at all. This is a bit of a different topic, but the bad news for me is that Android 14 increased the minimum SDK target to 23. That has killed a few good apps that I used. It (and Pixel 8a) also stops the support for 32 bit apps completely. This change me made look over the apps I use, and turns out I use many apps that are not even on Google Play anymore. I hope Google stops with the SDK push at least for a while because those apps do not have better alternatives available. Made me want to stick to Android 13. Advanced editor of Simple Gallery Pro that worked fine on my 4a, does not work anymore. Disappointing. In Android 14 notifications cannot be made sticky. You can swipe any notification away. I used a network speed monitor ([Network Speed](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.evozi.network)) and a todo list app ([NotifyMe](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)) that made their notifications sticky so you would not swipe them away by accident. It was so convenient. Not sure why they changed that. Music identification with Now Playing is much slower and way worse than the 4a. Not sure why but it does not recognise most of the music I try with it. **LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!** I feel like the camera in terms of photos is a minor upgrade, at best. It's all probably due to the higher resolution. So far the 8a is a bit warmer, and resolves just a tiny, almost unnoticeable amount of detail. The camera app is alright, but yet again, it really lacks pro options. I wonder if its developers are into photography at all. At least when you set the temperature now it tells you actual numerical values, but those settings reset, and there is no way to really lock them in for a photo or a video session. The reason you want to lock them is because Pixel's white balance is all over the place depending on the angle. [Two photos taken within seconds of each other, just at a different angle with auto white balance](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Pt9wMz4w\/Screenshot-2023-07-15-115403.jpg) I still consider [Nokia Lumia's camera app](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Windows-Camera.jpg) to be superior. I tried a modded gcam on the 8a that gives more options, but the 4a with Camera PX mod is better and has a higher potential. It can take nicer shots. There is no Camera PX for the 8a. Here is an example of \"I don't care what gcam app you use, just squeeze out the best this phone can do (handheld)\". The 4a is on the left and the 8a is on the right: [Fan - Low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/KmFCHT59\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-1.jpg) - The 4a has more grain and that \"radiation\" texture at 100% resolution, but it is sharper, focused, and has more details. The moment you downsize it, it looks noticeably better.[Fan - Realistic low light](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fDY6CCYt\/4a-vs-8a-20241202-2.jpg) - Again, the 4a is better. Close up focus is not good on the 8a. The 4a focuses closer, and its photos are sharper, even when 2x magnification is used. The 8a's camera makes everything BRIGHT! In automatic mode it turns night into a day. ~~The 8a has an ultrawide secondary camera, but I feel like it's pretty useless. At least, I haven't had a need for it.~~ And when I tried, the quality is rather poor. Would have preferred a 2x telephoto. UPDATE: I have used the ultrawide several times now, and I really started appreciating its usefulness, especially with video. But the quality is poor. [Here are some photo comparisons between the Pixel 4a and the 8a](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/9z9tbdM). I'll add some more photos as I go.I absolutely hated video quality on the 4a. I feel like it took horrendous 4K video. They tried this HDR thing with video where it tries to make shadows brighter, [and it just looked awful](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pixel-4a-video-quality-SaKfzup). I actually preferred the OG Pixel's 4K video and switched back to 1080p on the 4a, which was ok, still not great, but not as bad as the 4K mode. The 8a's video is better, both 1080p and 4k. It looks pretty good to me. Something I noticed with the 8a is that it has problems with focusing at times. It is something a few YouTube reviewers [have mentioned before](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ACIqHX9SpUw?&t=595). Hopefully it gets improved in the future. The 8a's LED light is weaker, the 4a's is noticeably brighter. **HAPTICS** Haptics are... different. I feel like the 4a has more \"punch\". It \"hits\" more noticeably, maybe because it's smaller? The 8a's haptics feel more \"internal\" somehow. Going from the OG Pixel's vibration motor to the 4a's haptic engine made me realise the importance of good haptics. It was a totally new, better experience. Going from the 4a to the 8a is not the same. They say Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus have amazing haptics. Haven't tried those extensively though. **CONNECTIVITY** The cell reception is good, have not noticed any issues or had any complaints. Never had any complaints with 4a either. [The GNSS reception is excellent](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/rcYKkWBq\/GPSData-20241211-02.png). The most accurate the 4a has ever gotten was 3m. [The 8a gets down to 2m](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1Pzf2MYW\/GPSData-20241211-01.jpg). Picks up GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou; all of them.**256GB, PLEASE!** The model that was available to me was the 128GB one. I feel in this day and age 128GB is not cutting it anymore. I was already down to 4 free gigabytes on the 4a. 256GB would be a welcome upgrade, but most retailers opt for the lowest storage option. 256GB should be the minimum storage. **THE REST** Speakers are louder than the 4a. Clearer? Not certain about that one. But louder for sure. An unpleasant surprise was that my SIM card did not work with the 8a. As soon as I inserted it, I received a \"SIM not supported\" message. Apparently newer Pixels require the \"Class C 1.8V\" sim card. I've ordered a replacement SIM, I really hope that fixes it. UPDATE: That fixed it. So if you are getting the \"SIM not supported\" message, get a new, Class C 1.8V, replacement from your carrier. You probably don't need to specify the class to them, just a replacement, it should be the new type that will be compatible. Haven't tried 5G at all, I do not need it. The Pixel 8a supports exFAT formatted devices connected through USB Type-C, which was introduced in Android 13, but the 4a did not have the drivers for it. Transferring things is tedious. I haven't found a way to move eSIMs over. **IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONS** At one point I was interested in the OnePlus 13, the X7 Ultra, the vivo X100 Ultra. I don't know about that now. After trying the 8a, I went to a phone shop and tried the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is the same size as the OnePlus and others. I have no idea how people manage that. Those phones are gigantic. Trying the 8a reaffirmed my love for smaller phones. Usually everyone complains and wants a smaller phone, but when the time comes, they buy the bigger one. I am one of those people who would actually buy the mini version. I would love a 5.8\" Pixel again but with tiny bezels, like on the Galaxy S24. Or even better, [a 5.5\" 120Hz screen with tiny bezels](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/jj3QfQfX\/S24-4a-4amini-13mini.png). Going back to the 4a's 60Hz screen is a bit jarring at first, but surprisingly you get adjusted to the downgrade pretty quickly, and the phone is such a joy to use, I love its size. **THE FOLLOW UP**I don't know how I feel about this upgrade to the 8a. I love the 120Hz smoothness, and yes I can yet again confirm, unlike the Pixel 8, the 8a is smooth. But the phone is big, and heavy! I don't really know what I upgraded? The camera is the same, a bit worse in certain areas; the speed difference is not noticeable in day to day tasks at all, 4G is enough for me, the finger print sensor is a downgrade in my opinion (I set up Face Unlock to mitigate it, and it works well), and the Android updates did not bring me any killer features I could not be without (80% charge limit is good) but at the same time I did not need all the problems it has brought me. The thought of aborting the upgrade and going back to the 4a has crossed my mind a few times. If I get used to the 8a I might go to the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro once it gets cheaper as it's the same size as the 8a, and it has a telephoto lens; or maybe the S25. The XL\/Plus phones are not for me. The only way I would ever get a phone that big is if it had an otherworldly camera, akin to the legendary [Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/49dptV5), when it came out.[Here are some photos of my Pixel 4a and 8a for you](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/gallery\/wyPM7qG).

And definitely the smartest smartphone out there (which is how MKBHD often refers to the pixel line in general as).However...battery life is just still not there yet. Everything else can beat the latest Samsung and the latest iPhone but if you've ever tried either of those brands' flagships in the past (I own an iPhone 15 for work and 14 before that) it unfortunately pales in comparison. It's the best pixel battery I've had sure, it gives me around 4h3Om - 5h30m of screen on time depending on how power hungry the apps I've used are, before it goes down to about 15%. And that might be enough for a lot of people, but similar usage similar screen on brings my iPhone to around 40% battery end of day.

I'm really tired of Apple\u2019s walled garden and not being able to install whatever I want, so I decided to give Android another shot. Last time I used Android was with the S8 and Pixel 4, and while I loved the OS, the apps just weren't as good as iOS.Fast forward to now, and honestly, I'm disappointed with the Pixel 8 Pro. I actually liked the Pixel 4 better, maybe it was the form factor or Android 12, but it just felt right in ways that the P8P doesn't. The OS now is fine but not great, though I really liked the home screen with the Microsoft launcher. But man, the apps on Android are still a mess. Everything\u2019s buggy, and Android ~~15~~ 14 feels worse than 12 in a lot of ways. Notifications are a pain, the lock screen is dumb and not as customizable as iOS which is just crazy. Trying to play a song from Spotify on my Sonos speakers almost gave me an ulcer. What really made me want to go back to iOS was the Pixel Watch. That thing is trash\u2014it\u2019s small, buggy, laggy, and the apps barely work. The photos from the P8P were fantastic, so no complaints there as expected.

This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!

I'm from Canada most of the year is cold and in the summer I'm mostly in my airconditioned home or workplace. In the Phillipines my house was largely air unconditioned and is hot and humid. I experienced  everything regarding heat with this phone that everyone talked about. I would even get times when my phone would refuse to charge cause it was so hot. It would just charge just enough to keep the battery going. My normal games would all the sudden drop frames where it would normally not struggle. No wonder there is such a diverse amount of experiences with the tensor chips when ambient conditions could cause this much issues for me. For extra reference I bought this pixel 8 last October so I've had my chance to get very familiar with this phone prior to the trip. It performed fine up until the trip.Edit: made some grammatical errors I wish I could edit the title.  Edit: after reading to replies I've come to realize the worst moments it would happen is when I would be in a dense area where I am having trouble connecting to cell services.

The only competition for this feature (which is free on pixels btw,) are devices like the Garmin InReach or SPOT, which cost $100 on the low end and up to $500 on the high end, while also requiring a subscription ranging from $15-$70 a month. Now yes, if you're out of service for an extended period of time these devices will still have some advantages, but having this functionality built into the device you already carry daily, for free, is going to be monumental for people's safety in remote areas.

Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears.

"},"1260":{"post_title":"The things I like about Android","self_text":"Quick thoughts from a long time iOS user who has recently moved to Android via a Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.My experience is just stock Android as presented by Google. I can't speak of other Android flavours. Also, I don't use other launchers.I feel that this list will grow or change. I also have a list of things I don't like or things I miss from iOS. I'll make a different post about that.Please feel free to contribute or discuss. As of September 5, 2024 here's my like-list.*****The lock screen** Android's lock screen is so much more considered and useful than the iOS lock screen. **At a glance** That at a glance widget on the home screen and on the lock screen is very good. It has just the right amount of information. It makes the most of the always on screen. The implementation of widgets and added information on the lock screen of iOS felt clumsy and prohibitive that I never really used it. So all it was was a clock.**What's playing?** This widget that is part of the Google Android experience is just spot on. I really like that it keeps a running log of music that I hear. I realise that these last two items are subsets of that lock screen. **Notifications** Okay, this is probably a subset as well of the lock screen, but just how Android handles notifications is much more intuitive and intelligent than iOS. I cannot put my finger precisely on what it is and it's probably a combination of a few things.**Gboard** This stock keyboard is fire. **Google dictation** I use Siri dictation on iOS. Or I should say I used to use it. From my first day back on Android (I was on Android maybe 7 years ago) I have been using Google dictate for most of my text entry and I can say that it is much better at recognising sentence tone and construct than Siri was able to do. I find that punctuation is also much better. **Google photos** Now I realise Google photos is also available in iOS. In fact, I was using it as well on my iPhone. I was backing up to iCloud and to Google photos. I received recommendations for memories and photos. However, the experience of having Google photos part of the core operating system experience it's much better. The Google photos app I feel is presently more useful at surfacing photos and memories from close to 200,000 photos on the cloud. **Google assistant\/Gemini** At this point I'm not really sure who I'm speaking to. Whoever it is, or maybe it's a combination of both has gotten appreciatively smarter over the last few days. Yes, I was using them on a few other devices and I could notice that it's smarter. It doesn't help that Siri has been seriously annoying me daily.**Call screening** Whatever it is that Google does when it transcribes the speaker on a call, that's pretty cool. **Apple music** I realise it's not an Android only app nor is it Android native, but I appreciate that the experience with Apple music on Android is on par with Apple music on iOS. It would be nice to get Apple music classical on Android as well."},"1261":{"post_title":"iPhone to Pixel","self_text":"For those who have left the iPhone slave camp and made it to the promised land, what is something you miss about iPhone, if anything?

At the same time people are very split on the Pixel 8 series mostly because of QC. The difference though is that Google is advertising pretty heavily, supposedly fixing the major issues aside from the weak chip, making a one-handed Pro device, and actively releasing new features. From the leaks I've seen Pixel 9 will have a slightly better chip, better display, more ram, more storage, more AI features, and will still have their arguably better UI.I have both the Pixel 8 and S24+ (went with these two because I'm not a fan of the large phones anymore). I'm consistently swapping my SIM between these devices, but a small pro version phone might be enough for me to ditch Samsung all together and I'm guessing I'm not the only one.I don't think Google will ever even come close to passing Samsung in total sales, but do you guys think in the next few years, Pixel flagships might become the new \"best android phone\"?"},"1263":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 a statement from Google?

As for how it looks, I already feel that it looks and feels expensive. Only time will tell. Of course, the Pixel series has looked good in the past as well, but this one looks like it can go up against Apple and Samsung in terms of visual eye candy. This is subjective though. I think the 9 series will help the Pixel phones to truly crossover into the premium flagship category once and for all with the big hitters like the Galaxy S flagships and the fruit phone of course.

I was a Motorola Droid user before the Pixel series came out, and I fell in love with the simplicity of the original Pixel XL, the slick look, the fingerprint scanner, and the capability of the phone overall. I bought my Pixel XL in July of 2017, and kept it until the battery gave up in February of 2022, when I then got the Pixel 6. I was never really overly-happy with the 6, other than the size. I felt like the battery would drain really fast with minimal use, the camera was extremely disappointing, the phone itself felt really cheap, the camera shutter made a rattling noise every time my phone would move, I could go on. Because it worked however, I kept it. The battery finally died not too long ago, and I just went to T-Mobile to trade it in for a Pixel 9 Pro XL.Good lord, right off the bat, this phone FEELS far more premium, and more worth the price tag than the 6 ever did. I like the iPhone aesthetic the phone has going on with the rounded edges. I also love the nice, large screen. I know it's not significantly bigger than the 6, but it's still noticeable to me. I especially love the new camera spot, and the way that it's raised and protected by the aluminum body, as opposed to the all-glass camera on the 6. It also has a nice weight to it, not too crazy, but enough to know you have a high-end piece of tech in your hands.As for the software, the 9 operates like I think the 6 should have. It's very reminiscent of what it felt like to switch to the original Pixel XL from my cheap Droids. The animations are smooth, and I don't even have the smooth animation option on. The themes, stock wallpapers, even ringtones are excellent. The camera is also a HUGE improvement over the 6. I would take pictures of documents to scan them with my 6, and the picture would always come out looking like my lenses were smudged, and my astral photography always left something to be desired. The camera on the 9 Pro has been phenomenal. Close-up pictures are much more clear, and the options for getting the perfect shot are plentiful. I have not tried the astral photography settings on the 9 Pro yet, but I will be doing so as soon as there's a clear night and no moon. I will say, I don't believe that the 9 Pro camera is on par with the Samsung cameras, which are some of the best on the market, but it at least rivals, if not surpasses the camera on the iPhone.Overall, Google has dramatically improved the Pixel series from the 6. The 9 Pro has better battery life, smoother operation, an overall nicer look and more premium feel, and the camera actually lives up to the hype. As long as the battery has better longevity than the battery in the 6, I'm hoping to have this phone for at least as long as I had the original Pixel XL for.

There, the icons are kept misaligned with the cut-out while remaining screen area was moved lower... Particularly with this screen I previously thought (before the update), how they perfectly balanced UX with the cutout, as the space given by round borders between top system toggles gives enough space from the cutout without jeopardizing screen estate.

There's some truth to it, but ultimately the cooling capability of the P9P is actually quite impressive.Quick context on ZZZ before I move on - it's basically an action (gacha) game akin to Devil May Cry (nowhere as complex though). It's a pretty new game made on Unity, so while it's not the most difficult thing to run, it is a modern, popular game that can stress the current best phones.Quick disclaimer as well - I did NOT do a controlled test of the thermal and gaming performance, so take the information in this thread as more of an anecdote than actual evidence.**Settings**So, starting off, I could not see how the author could have possibly \"maxed\" the settings without overheating the device in a few minutes and killing the framerate. I aimed to maintain close to 60 FPS for about 30 min of gameplay, so while I was able to keep most settings on \"High\", I still had to drop a few settings to \"Medium\". I was debating on keeping the rendering resolution at \"High\" or \"Medium\", but I eventually kept it at \"High\" since it looked the nicest.**Framerate**No matter what settings I used, the framerate cannot stay consistently at 60 FPS even at lowest, but for about 70% of my playtime, the game was around \\~60 FPS.* In stages with multiple enemies or elaborate environments, framerate can vary from 40 to 60 FPS. I'd say it averages around 45 FPS when the phone is cool\/warm.* In stages with very few enemies or a simple 1-on-1, framerate varied from 55 to 60 FPS.* Game will do massive FPS drops randomly, because I assume the shader cache is being made, which is a common thing with games. Once the shader cache is made, it stops stuttering.**Framerate after Thermal Throttling**The phone will still overheat after enough playtime, make no mistake about that. The P9P XL is very neat, but it's not a miracle phone by any shot.Now what is impressive about the phone is that performance doesn't get thermally throttled anywhere as fast as my previous phones (P7P and P4XL) while maintaining acceptable performance. I was using a controller to play the game, so my phone was on my bed getting choked by my mattress.* In stages with multiple enemies, framerate fell to around 40ish FPS after 30 minutes or so.* In stages with few enemies, framerate consistently stayed at 60 FPS even after 30 minutes.By the end of each 30-min play session, the phone was hot to the touch but surprisingly not \"burning\" like my old phones felt. When I actually had the phone on my hand instead of the mattress, the phone got noticeably cooler, so I assume if I had given my phone a modicum of airflow, I could have avoided throttling for even longer.**Takeaways**My personal takeaways were:1. The vapor chamber actually is a noticeable benefit and not just hype.2. Gaming performance is sustained for a lot longer than expected. I hated playing games on my phone because the phone would start throttling in about 10 minutes, but I can actually see myself gaming more on my P9P XL.3. Tensor G4 does OK for gaming. Based on what everyone was saying before the phone's release, I assumed the Tensor G4 would absolutely shit itself like my P7P did, but a mix of decent processing power and fantastic thermal cooling seems to help it a lot.4. The phone is *so* nice to use.**Some other interesting findings: P7P vs P9P XL**I did a rough comparison between my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL and found that my P7P actually ran the game faster but throttled faster as well.* When not throttling, the P7P was running at a solid 60 FPS walking around in a location (Scott's Outpost).* In that same location, the P9P varied from 50 to 60 FPS, occasionally dipping to 40.Now during actual gameplay, the P7P loses steam in only about 10 min, dropping from 60 FPS to 40 FPS. The P9P, on the other hand, stays at a consistent 50 FPS after 10 min. P7P's hot spot is tightly localized around the camera, while the P9P distributes the heat around the upper 2\/3rds of the back.~~I don't know if the cause of the difference in peak performance is simply due to poor optimization or strange SOC behavior.~~ Regardless, the P9P's endurance is unquestionable. I think all the other videos and reviews I've seen also support this.I figured out the reason for the strange dispairty above. Despite the same graphical settings in-game, the actual graphical fidelity is noticeably lower in the P7P than in the P9P. So essentially, the P9P is taxed more, yet presents with acceptable performance, and can maintain that performance for a significantly longer time. Very solid phone for gaming in my opinion.Hope that helps. LMK if you have any questions. Happy to answer them."},"1279":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL - unable to connect to car bluetooth, help?","self_text":"I just upgraded from P6P to P9Pxl, and everything has been great, except that I'm unable to connect to my car's bluetooth.

I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8\/28.  On 8\/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9\/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9\/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9\/16 I received the following response:\"After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.\"Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a \"product specialist\".  The \"product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google\u2019s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.

My hope is that my experience will encourage others and offset the fears that someone could have from reading the sub. ====* **November 15th** - I ordered my Pixel 9 Pro through the Google Store. Thanks to this community I learned about the 30% off coupon from the Google Play Store. I tend to gift A LOT of subs to people I watch on Twitch. Because of this, I was a gold member on the play store without even realizing it. I was able to apply the coupon and Google evaluated my Pixel 6 Pro as being worth $425 dollars. Due to them saying the value could go down, I check the \"return phone to me if phone trade in value decreases\" box. * **November 18th** - I receive my package a day earlier than I expected from FedEx. There wasn't anyone home so the driver left my package on my front door. FedEx showed me a picture of the person who was responsible for delivering my package. I verified via my security camera that this was the same person and they didn't take the package after photographing it. It sits at my front door till a family member comes home and puts it inside. My new phone is inside with the trade in packaging. * **November 18th** (same night) - I record myself putting the old phone into the trade in box. I follow all the instructions to the letter. I factory reset my phone, clean it (more of a personal preference honestly), package it, and use all the security seals to seal it. This is done on camera in one continuous video. * **November 19th** - I drop it off at my local UPS and they give me a drop off receipt which I retain. * **November 21st** - I verify that the Pixel 6 Pro I sent has been received by the Juliet, TN facility via UPS's tracking number.* **November 24th** - I receive an email from Google verifying they received my trade in and they were going to offer me $450 for my trade in (+$25 more). The money returns to my bank account that same day. _____All in all, it was an extremely positive experience. A total of 10 days and a final cost of the new phone after the 30% off coupon ($299.70) and the $450 trade in was $250.99 before taxes.

I am the former. When I tried Pixel 8 it was immediately obvious that it stuttered badly. I enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display, but it never felt like it ran at 120Hz. It does not have that \"120Hz smoothness\" anywhere. I have tried many units of Pixel 8, they all stuttered the same way. That phone is not smooth but any definition of the word. The moment I tried Pixel 9, the very moment I swiped down on the notification center to access settings, I immediately noticed that it was different; it was smooth. Scrolling in the settings is smooth. I went ahead and enabled 120Hz in Settings > Display. I compared YouTube, Chrome, Settings. There is night and day difference between Pixel 8 and Pixel 9. With the Pixel 9, you can feel the 120Hz-iness, scrolling is smooth. It is how a 120Hz phone should feel. I compared it to the S24 which was next to it, and I think they are on par in terms of smoothness. Now, smoothness does not mean no hick ups. Pixel 8's UI felt like it was ratcheted when you scrolled, there was micro stuttering everywhere, Pixel 9 does not have that, but it does have an occasional hick up where the UI halts for a millisecond, as if it is waiting for something to load in order to continue. But that was not often, and because the overall UI is smooth, it was not that noticeable. I think all Android phones have it. The S24 has it too. EDIT: A small update to this. I tried another Pixel 9 and it noticeably stuttered. Also tried several Pixel 9 Pros, they did not stutter.Another positive is the design, the Pixel 9 is gorgeous! Instantly makes the Pixel 8 look outdated. In fact, I believe Google made a mistake; should gone with matte sides for the \"Pro\" models.

Despite the overall hate for this fingerprint sensor I actually found it to be decent even in its early days in the sense that it was at least consistent with its 75% success rate. On a Pixel 1 or 3 which I kept around for photo backup purposes, if your fingers were wet coming out of a shower or the kitchen, any leftover moisture would screw it up. If your fingers were wrinkly, you were screwed. The optical sensor of the Pixel was surprisingly generous about this.* Pixel 7 Pro: About as accurate as my P6P in final ~1 year mark but faster. Only slightly.* Pixel 8 Pro: No problems again, just as good as my P7P* Pixel 9 Pro: Maybe when I initially set it up, it felt fast and nice without a screen protector, but over time and since adding a screen protector, it may have regressed. I had expected some life changing unlock, but it\u2019s more or less the same as my P8P, in fact I\u2019d even argue it\u2019s worse. Success rate is like 90-95% on one thumb and I\u2019ve re-setup both fingers with the screen protector and even turned on screen protector mode the same way my 8 Pro suggested I turn it on. There are a lot of times where I have to press down hard with one finger whereas the 8 Pro I can get away with lightly tapping the screen only. The major pro is no blinding light but it wasn\u2019t really an issue for me with the 8 Pro anyway because I\u2019m not that often trying to unlock my phone in complete darkness.So I\u2019m slightly disappointed not only because the performance is just so-so and it\u2019s more or less the same as the 8 Pro but slightly worse but more importantly because the toxicity on this sub.

Right now I find myself looking forward to upgrading to One UI 6.1 and getting all those Galaxy AI (artificial intelligence) features. The thing is, I tend to change phones every 3 or 4 years and I don't know whether to switch to the future Galaxy S25 series or switch to the future Google Pixel 9 ProI think One UI is a more complete operating system with more features than stock Android, but do we really need all that huge amount of configuration and customization options that One UI brings? Well, in my personal case, I don't think I need all that, but \"it's better to have all that and not need it than to need it and not have it\". I, for example, am not even interested in the extreme customization offered by the \"Good Lock\" App, I have never installed it and I do not even plan to install it because with the standard customization options of One UI it is enough and more than enough. I really customize very little One UI and I like to use it as original as possible, I only modify a few very few thingsOn the other hand, we have the stock Android of the Google Pixel and its advantages over One UI are very easy: they receive first of all the new versions of Android, it has the software with the least amount of unnecessary Apps pre-installed (it is a very clean software), the user interface is more \"user friendly\" than One UI and the fact of having fewer options and configurations that One UI gives it an extra plus in ease for use by less Geek users, and... Although it may seem absurd to you, another great sale of Android Stock is that snow through the App drawer is done vertically, which is much more comfortable and naturalThe truth is that I don't think it's worth abandoning One UI for Stock Android. When you upgrade from one version of Android to a newer one, there are few new features or improvements that are gained. On the other hand, for those of us who own a Samsung when we go from a version of One UI to a newer one, there are many more improvements and new features that we gain than those that Google Pixel users gain by upgrading from Android to a newer version. In addition to the fact that One UI is the Android that is best understood and has the best integration with a Windows PC and with One UI we have the mother of all the functionalities that Pixel users do not have: Samsung DEX. One UI is better and more complete and I was able to give more of itself a lot more than Android Stock canBut on the hardware side, I see a serious problem with the pixels. The pixels come to market with a processor with a mid-range power, and a high-end processor of the year such as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 doubles it and even more in power. That makes me doubt how well it can withstand those 7 years of Android version updates knowing that every operating system as it evolves and gains in functions and new features needs more hardware resources. That's a problem that the Samsung Galaxy S series don't have because they come out with high-end hardware and that's why for me the Galaxy S series can withstand those 7 years of refresh in a better wayBut that's just my opinion, what do you guys think?"},"1292":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro \/ Pro XL - Camera thoughts and some urgent need of software updates","self_text":"Overall I love the cameras on the 9 pro XL which is my phone, it can hang there with the very best (they all have some downsides).....

Apple's ProRAW however uses a software trick to apply noise reduction in shadows without changing hardware.  Isn't that ironic?https:\/\/petapixel.com\/2020\/12\/21\/understanding-apple-proraw\/ It's pretty interesting to compare Google's HDR+ with Bracketing RAW to Apple's ProRAW.  Some differences: 1) [Google uses pixel-shifting via handshake for demosiacing meaning true to life RGB chroma values](https:\/\/blog.research.google\/2018\/10\/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html?m=1) -- just like film.  Apple uses a Bayer demosiacing algorithm that fakes chroma values, and this can't be avoided with ProRAW -- these colors are baked into ProRAW itself.  \"[Google's] result of the merge process is a full RGB image, which canbe defined at any desired resolution. This can be processed further by the typical camera pipeline (spatial denoising, color correction, tone-mapping, sharpening) or alternatively saved for further offline processing in a non-CFA raw format like Linear DNG [Adobe 2012]\" [(Ignacio Garcia-Dorado, Handheld Multiframe Super Resolution 2019)](https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8RVlXMsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=8RVlXMsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC). However, the Burst Fusion algorithim creates odd artifacts at 1x zoom, so it activates only at 1.2x zoom and greater.  So to increase photo resolution and color accuracy on Pixel phones, always shoot at at least 1.2x zoom for maximum quality images.  Since the algorithm produces artifacts past about 5x zoom, this is why Google decided to make telephoto lens hardware at around 5x zoom on the Pixel 6 Pro, 7 Pro and 8 Pro.  The hardware only takes over when it actually produces a benefit over digital zoom, and that isn't until about 5x.   Then, the algorithm applies to the telephoto sensor for a maximum zoom of about 5x * 5x = ~15x max quality zoom on Pro Pixel phones, which is exactly about what you see on the spec sheets.  Finally, since the algorithm doesn't provide any benefits between about 2x and 5x zoom, [Google invented a new feature called Zoom Fusion](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/super-res-zoom-google-pixel\/) to combine images between two sensors at the same time: from the main sensor and the telephoto sensor, simultaneously, to enhance the quality of photos between the 2x and 5x zooms. And that's great. 2) Google uses 14-bit Linear RBG color data in RAWs.  Apple uses 12-bit color data in ProRAW.  3) Android's UltraHDR uses an 8-bit JPEG with HLG tone maps for hdr highlights.  This means Pixel photos may exhibit color banding with UltraHDR *and* p3 color *both* enabled.  This may be why wide color is disabled by default on new Pixels.  Apple uses a 10-bit HEIF file that is based on the HEIC video codec, so there will be no more color banding in apple hdr photos than is seen on consumer 10-bit UltraHDR video like UHD Blu-Rays. HEIF also use HLG to display an sdr friendly version of the image on sdr displays.  HEIF provides a superior HDR final image though.  However, most phones do have 8-bit displays (but not all) so it may not really matter yet.4) There is no way to export a RAW image to HEIF from Adobe Lightroom.  So you can't take a Pixel RAW and export to a 10-bit HEIF, which would combine the best of both worlds in terms of image quality on an Android phone. However, you *can* do this if you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or a spare iPhone with the Darkroom App on the Apple App Store.  I just exported a Pixel RAW shot with ultrahdr and p3 color enabled to a 10-bit HEIF file and I can say the colors do in fact appear wider in gamut and closer to the RAW file colors on the HEIF compared to the p3 UltraHDR jpeg.  5) The best workflow might be to shoot raw on a pixel, at least 1.2x zoom, [master the dng file in lightroom as a Linear DNG\/camera native settings for hdr](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/10\/10\/hdr-explained), color grading and noise reduction, then export as a dng and import that edited dng into darkroom on an Apple device.  Then, without changing anything, export as an heif and upload online. For the record, I'm happy the Pixels don't do any artificial noise reduction beyond the effects of super-res-zoom\/burst-fusion pixel shidting to their raws, which naturally reduces color noise by not interpolating anything in the first place, you just have to remember to set that 1.2x zoom -- can't forget it, it's super important.  I prefer the google pixel camera pipeline, as [any noise reduction you want can easily be applied in lightroom according to your creative vision](https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2023\/04\/18\/denoise-demystified).  However, since Pixels do not use Bayer demosiacing (at 1.2x digital zoom and greater) the AI-powered denoise feature in Lightroom will not work on Pixel phone RAWs but the manual denoise features will.  These will damage color accuracy and detail sightly, but will reduce the color noise in shadows of (mainly older) Pixel phones, if there is any, and will provide a similar result to Apple's ProRAW.  Google has been striving to reduce color noise *without* software denoising, as it damages color accuracy and detail.  That's why hdr+ with bracketing was invented for Pixel 5, and why Pixel 6, 7 and 8 got *hardware* upgrades to improve shadow detail with larger sensors and pixel-binning.  This is also why full 50mp images are generally not available -- they'd not reduce noise in the shadows.  Nothing is arbitrary at Google! :P  Btw, [Apple copied Google's Burst Fusion inovation with their Photonic Engine on iPhone 14.](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/features\/iphone-14-camera-explained-photonic-engine-quad-pixel-sensors-and-more)   Whether or not they are using pixel shifting, nobody is sure, [the iPhone 15 Pro seems to be very suspiciously doing what appears to be basically exactly the same thing with its 1.2x \"28mm\" and 1.5x \"28mm\" modes.](https:\/\/m.dpreview.com\/articles\/2668153890\/apple-s-iphone-15-and-15-pro-imaging-tech-examined)  Google did it first though.

Every Samsung phone I ever had was great in the first year, after that I'd be plagued with insane lag and slowdowns. I used to root them and install custom firmware to debloat and improve performance. Unfortunately, not something I've wanted to do since the S7edge. Just wanted something that worked out of the box, for years and years. For that reason, I've had the Pixel 2, 3, 4 and Pixel 5 until i decided to give Samsung another shot with the S22 Pus. It was great for a while, but soon as I hit that one year mark i got plagued with the typical Samsung slow downs yet again. I should have learned my lesson and never given them another chance.   Anyways, I know the Pixel 9 is around the corner but I'm not looking for flagship models and frankly I'm sick and tired of $1000+ Phones. So I've decided that a Pixel 8 would be a good choice considering they tend to go on heavy sales and Google had increase software updates to 7 years with these newer Pixels. So it gives me far more confidence when buying a model from a previous year knowing I'm covered for years to come.   My only question is, how are these Tensor chips? I heard their Exynos based and manufactured by Samsung which gives me the heebie jeebies. The reviews out there have been a mixed bag and I can't quite figure out if a lot of these issues are overblown and people are being petty over little things. I've heard certain apps tend to lag, that battery drain can be an issue amongst others. The Pixel 3 and 5 have by far been my favourite phones. And had software support not stopped for the Pixel 5 (i also shattered the screen and its just not worth repairing) I'd just keep using my Pixel 5 for a bit longer because after 4+ years i turned it on and it still runs like a dream.  Since the Pixel 8 has been around for close to a year, I'd love to have some of you guys chime in and give me some real world opinions on this model because 90% of the reviews out there don't really give someone an idea of long term use.

I can use the telephoto from the roadside to take pics of cool flowers in someone's driveway without getting close. But the macro mode isn't as good but I guess not a lot of people use it. Maybe I'm spoilt because the Redmi has a dedicated macro lens which is low MP but still takes solid shots. The lens change is very visible while in photos and in videos.And finally **battery**.

All the while having iPhones for work. So I've carried both major OSes in my pocket for the last 10 years or so. I had one outlier for a hot minute and bought a Samsung S21 Ultra a few years ago. But that was only for a year.Anyway.With all that history, I'll say I always loved the build quality of iPhones and always felt like my Google phones were very plasticy. iPhones have just had that premium feel and weight to them for many years now. My Samsung phone even felt meh. But now _this thing_ has completely blown my mind. I just switched from a pixel 7 pro and had constant overheating issues, never felt premium, but the software is frankly what has kept me around for so long. Android made by Google is so much better than Android with a Samsung flavor on it. Samsung just has a lot of bloat. But that's not what this is about. This is about hardware. ## Overheating?Nah. This doesn't happen now on my new phone. The 9 pro xl is great. My 7 pro would overheat when I would wireless Android auto, wireless charge, record videos, play games, scroll Instagram, tiktok, name it, I got `Device is getting too hot` warnings daily for about a year. I replaced it via Google Fi warranty\/insurance with the same issues. The 9 pro xl I have taken through rigorous testing and it's been able to keep cool throughout all of my usage and testing. This thing is my daily driver now and I'll have it for 2 years at least. Time will tell. ## Build Quality The weight in my hand is everything. Enough said. Before I even turned this thing on it felt premium in my hand. The metal on it is very smooth to touch, and texting with it feels great ## Battery life Lasts a full day+. Easy. Pixel 7 pro would barely last a day without a quick juice up.

It is a _seamless_ experience. Surprisingly, Google Assistant and Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro XL work together seamlessly. This means you can switch between them even when Gemini can't handle specific commands like home routines. In such cases, Gemini will intelligently hand off the task to Google Assistant.This is a major improvement over previous versions where handing off commands wasn't smooth (because Google assistant was baked in and Gemini was installed as a third-party app). If you rely heavily on Google Home and smart speakers, you'll appreciate how well Gemini integrates on the Pixel 9 series phones.# EDIT 1 - camera ## Camera(s)Let's be real. Google sensors aren't the best in the market. But they aren't the worst either. I think that's what has made them pretty amazing is what they can do with the software. Add me is meh. Try it once or twice. I don't know how often I'd actually do that vs being in the actual photo. There's also something about handing a stranger your phone to take a special photo of your family and them returning it to you for you to see they took 5 selfies of themselves before handing it back. \ud83d\ude02The bump itself isn't too bad.I slap a case onto my device the moment I get it. So I got a Mous case. It lays fairly level on the table now. # EDIT 2 - Charging ## Charging I have a few Anker 45w chargers and one of the power bricks that can do like 200w fast charging on my MacBook with a digital display. It registered like 28w pull from that with fluctuating load depending on if I was using the device or if it was idle. If I was using it, it would go down slightly. This is where I think it got warm. When connected to a charger and when I was initially setting up the device. Other than that it's stayed cool. Wireless charging it got somewhat warm in my case with a magsafe power Bank. Outside the case it was slightly cooler. But still never for any warnings about the device getting too hot inside or outside of the case. Edit 3 - 7 pro XL changed to 7 pro.

Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1323":{"post_title":"Android 15 will let you find your Pixel 8 even when it's off","self_text":""},"1324":{"post_title":"Real-life pictures and specs of Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL","self_text":""},"1325":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro smartphone review - The compact flagship with great cameras","self_text":""},"1326":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel Watch 3 has 2,000nit peak brightness, 20% faster charging & more","self_text":""},"1327":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is one of the top 10 premium phones in the US","self_text":""},"1328":{"post_title":"Here's what the canceled Pixel Tablet 2 would have been - Android Authority","self_text":""},"1329":{"post_title":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\"","self_text":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\" but will be coming to more high-end devices in the near future according to Terence Zhang, a Developer Relations engineer at Google, [during #TheAndroidShow](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pou4o1X1DI4).The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have the same chipset (Tensor G3) but different amounts of memory (8GB versus 12GB).

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model.

My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1440":{"post_title":"Real-life pictures and specs of Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL","self_text":""},"1441":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 offers full RCS transfer to Google Messages","self_text":""},"1442":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 pink revealed - hanibioud","self_text":""},"1443":{"post_title":"Giant Google Pixel 9 leak reveals the Fold, faster charging, battery, and more","self_text":""},"1444":{"post_title":"The Google Pixel 9 finally lets you choose when to transfer data from your old phone","self_text":""},"1445":{"post_title":"'Call Notes' could be a new Pixel 9 feature that records and transcribes phone calls","self_text":""},"1446":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 review - The small Google smartphone has taken the wrong path","self_text":""},"1447":{"post_title":"Exclusive: This is Google AI, and it's coming to the Pixel 9 - android authority","self_text":""},"1448":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro smartphone review - The compact flagship with great cameras","self_text":""},"1449":{"post_title":"The one upside of the expensive Pixel 9 is that the 9a might be worth buying","self_text":""},"1450":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel Watch 3 has 2,000nit peak brightness, 20% faster charging & more","self_text":""},"1451":{"post_title":"Exclusive: First Look at Pixel 9 Pro's Add Me, Pixel Screenshots & More New Features","self_text":""},"1452":{"post_title":"The Google Pixel 9 could use Samsung\u2019s best display tech - phandroid","self_text":""},"1453":{"post_title":"Review: Google's Pixel 9 display is as good as it gets","self_text":""},"1454":{"post_title":"Exclusive: Google Pixel 9 has a new weather app, here's what it looks like","self_text":""},"1455":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 series could launch earlier this year, potentially at Google I\/O","self_text":""},"1456":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is one of the top 10 premium phones in the US","self_text":""},"1457":{"post_title":"Here's what the canceled Pixel Tablet 2 would have been - Android Authority","self_text":""},"1458":{"post_title":"Source: Google has canceled the Pixel Tablet 2, not the Tab 3","self_text":""},"1459":{"post_title":"Exclusive: This is the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in Every Color","self_text":""},"1460":{"post_title":"Shhhh, everyone pretend the Pixel 9 Pro temperature sensor isn't there","self_text":""},"1461":{"post_title":"The best foldable photo smartphone?

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Here are the results.","self_text":"*\\*I'm going to paste the text from my original post that I made when I started this experiment. I updated it as it went along, but figured that a new post would be necessary to reach people interested who did not come back to the original post for updates.\\**  ***TLDR: Pebblebee and the Google Find My Device Network are hot garbage and the entire thing has not been rolled out in a way that it can be useful, reliable, or worth spending your money on at this time.***Original Post:  I did a local test around town today to see if our newly arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens.***Update 1***\u00a0**July 3rd**After the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.***Update 2***\u00a0**July 4**As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.***Update 3***\u00a0**July 5**I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.***Update 4***\u00a0**July 6**The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.   The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.  **\\*Conclusion\\***It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.  The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.  Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.  I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?  I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time. I certainly won't put any more money into this product anytime soon. It's a pain to have to carry around an iPad Mini when we travel to utilize the superior Apple Air Tags, but it is what it is. We are a household that only uses Pixel phones and for some various reasons, can't switch over to iPhone at this point in time. Oddly enough, this tracker thing is somewhat of an important piece of tech with the travel we do and our desire to track items when abroad, but again, we'll stick with Apple for that task for the foreseeable future.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"1511":{"post_title":"I just put a PebbleBee and an Apple Air Tracker in a box and am mailing it to a family member a few states away to test the Android Find My Device capabilities.","self_text":"I did a local test around town today to see if our nely arrived PebbleBee trackers would work well. Unfortunately, they failed miserably and were never found, even after a few hours. (Yes, they are functioning correctly.Anyway, as a test, I put the new PB tracker and an Air Tag in a box and we'll see what happens. *Update 1* July 3rdAfter the postal worker picked it up, it took almost 11 hours before pinging to a new location. The Apple Air Tag worked great the whole time and kept giving me accurate updates throughout the day, but it was crickets for the PB. Even when the box was at the local post office where more phones should have been gathered, there was nothing from it. The Air Tag updated on the roads both in the postal carrier truck and also the semi that hauled it from my local city to a major city sorting hub. That PB didn't find a single Android sole to connect to the entire time.Finally 11 hours later, it updated its location when it reached a large USPS sorting warehouse outside of a big city. This was the parcel's 2nd large hub stop. Since then it hasn't shown any update, but I'll continue tracking it and the Apple Air Tag tomorrow to follow it on the journey and return here to provide more edit updates to the post.*Update 2* July 4As of this morning, the Apple Air Tag continues to update and show the parcel has stayed at the large sorting center overnight. The PB on the other hand has managed to get worse. It no longer shows its one and only updated position from last night at that sorting center. It now resorts back to its original position of being at my house before the postal worker picked up the package. When I ask it to update, it just spins for a moment and continues to say it was last seen at my home. Somehow, it completely lost that one movement update that happened 11 hours after leaving.The PB finally pinged back at the sorting warehouse today late in the afternoon. It was the one and only updated it has given so far today. One thing I'm noticing that is super unhelpful is the fact that the Find My Device map display is not in satellite mode. It's just a grey scale map. The Apple map is super detailed satellite mode and that makes pinpointing a location much easier. I don't expect any movement from the parcel today since it's a federal holiday, so I likely won't have anything to add until tomorrow.*Update 3* July 5I checked a few more times today. The PebbleBee is still reverting back to my home from July 3rd. Apple tag still working great as usual. My parcel is in a border state now, preparing for delivery tomorrow. The family member receiving it will mail it right back and that will allow extended testing. Again, the Apple tag updated going down the highway the entire time. The PebbleBee... nothing.*Update 4*  July 6The parcel has reached its destination. After the Apple Air Tag showed me it had reached a sorting warehouse about 30 minutes north of the final destination yesterday, I was able to track it this morning as it headed down the interstate to the final stop town. All this time, the Pebblebee was showing me its original location of my home on July 3rd. It was no longer even showing me its last known location that I had seen it update from when at a sorting center in my current home state.The parcel will now be mailed back to me, which will allow more opportunities to see how the tracking will go, but I feel safe it concluding it from the one-way trip it just made.*Conclusion*It goes without saying that the Apple Air Tag worked wonderfully. Not only did it give me regular updates at post offices and postal sorting centers, it would even regularly update going down the road in the truck it was being carried in. So yes, the Air Tag is wonderful and that's why we maintain one Apple device so that we can utilize this technology in our suitcases for travel and a few other various things we track.The Pebblebee and Google Find My Device network is, at this point in time, a complete failure. I don't think I'll send the Pebblebee trackers back, as I'd like to see how this goes in the future, plus we'll be traveling to another country soon that has a 78% market share of Android and only 21.5% market share of Apple. I'm especially interested in how that works out.Probably the most disappointing thing about the Pebblebee was that despite it giving me just a few updates along the way when it was in large sorting warehouses, it quickly forgot these data points and would revert to its starting location of my home back on the day that I mailed the parcel. This is not helpful whatsoever. It was confirmed in other places at least twice, but instead of keeping that logged, it just...forgets it.I also noted above that when pulling up the Find My Device page in a web browser on the computer and not on the app, the Pebblebee devices were not present. Why is this? What if you lose your phone and need to track these things in a browser on the computer. You're just out of luck?I can't advise buying into the Android trackers at this time.

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"1513":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1514":{"post_title":"Are Pixel and OnePlus the only real alternatives to Samsung Galaxy?","self_text":"I've been in the Samsung Android ecosystem for some time, but I'm tired of Samsung Galaxy not having the ability to have more than one profile on a phone (though they're fine with doing that on their tablets?).I want the ability to have a separate work and personal profile, but that's just not possible on any Samsung Galaxy phone.I don't want to leave the Samsung ecosystem since I enjoy their products (and I have a Samsung watch and ear buds), but it really doesn't look like adding multiple profile options is something they're going to do.But it seems that Samsung Galaxy seems to have the best camera for an Android phone, so I think I'm going to have to choose which one I want more.

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress.

Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"},"1518":{"post_title":"I think for the first time, I cannot think of a single realistic feature I would want from a smartphone","self_text":"Just like I imagine most tech enthusiasts, I have my list of criteria for what I would consider to be my \"perfect smartphone\". Slim bezels, a high frequency screen, a flat screen, faster storage, a fast and efficient SoC, enough RAM, great battery life, fast charging, wireless charging, good connectivity chips (BT, Wi-Fi, 5G, GPS), good cameras, water-dust resistance, good unlocking tech, Type-C, SIM + eSIM, good audio codes, etc. Before, whenever a new phone would come out I would check its specs out, and there was always something that was not quite up to scratch, be it thicker, uneven bezels, or a slow storage, it was pretty much always back to \"This is almost perfect, but wait for the next year's model\". But for 2025, I think for the first time I have absolutely nothing that I could realistically wish for in a smartphone. For example, I just checked out OnePlus 13. That phone has it all. If I had to nitpick, I would say it needs better cameras, but what it currently has is fine too. Even in 2024, the phone specs were already there, the only things I was not happy with was the base storage still starting at 128GB for some smartphones and the lack of ubiquitous UWB. Samsung also used Exynos for Europe in their Galaxy S24 phones which I would not get. For 2025 though, the base storage *should* start at 256GB with UFS 4.0 and UWB should be more available too. All flagships that will come out will be more than enough, I wonder how they will even differentiate themselves. Now, not to offend anyone, but there are some specs that I would consider as fantasy specs right now, features such as: a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSD slot, an IR blaster. And I would not expect them. So, for me, the specs are there. Which I am quite happy with, I love when a technology overtakes my wants. There is nothing else I can even really think of what I would want in a smartphone conceptually. Maybe a full screen fingerprint reader? Two USB Type-C ports? I still wish for a true mini flagship smartphone. But, that again, is probably unrealistic.Is there anything where the current smartphones are quite there for you? What would you like, realistically?"},"1519":{"post_title":"What keeps you on Android in 2024?","self_text":"Honest question. I\u2019ve spent years on both Android and iOS, but I\u2019ve leaned more towards iOS is the past 5 years for sure. The reason I ask is because Android is starting to intrigue me again after being on iOS this long. I\u2019ve used both extensively over the years, and I really miss playing around with my phone and truly making it mine, mostly with Nova Launcher, icon packs and wallpapers. But, there\u2019s reasons why Apple does so well. For me, it\u2019s utility. My phone is a communication device well before it\u2019s a toy these days, and in recent years I\u2019ve just felt that the iPhone does a better job at communication (iMessage being a huge deal breaker for me). I was a big BlackBerry fan before this, that\u2019s how important communication was to me. In fact, one of the last Android devices I had was the BlackBerry Key2. The physical keyboard had so many functional benefits. Anyways, here\u2019s my brief list for why I\u2019ve stayed with my iPhone in recent years. Please feel free to share why you agree or disagree, I low key want to be persuaded into getting an S24 Ultra \ud83d\ude021. iMessageEasily the biggest reason. Some people don\u2019t see it as a big deal, I do. I live in Canada. Almost everyone I know has an iPhone. I hate when I text someone with a green bubble. It\u2019s like, did they get my message? Can I send them the video I just took of my dog without it looking choppy? Oh it\u2019s a 1 minute video, ya forget it. Oh I wanna FaceTime my friend quick\u2026 oh wait, they\u2019re the green bubble friend, never mind. Okay I need to start a group chat to plan my dad\u2019s 60th birthday party. Oh wait, that friend I have to text separately. There\u2019s so many reasons why iMessage is great! Yes, WhatsApp works great, but not everyone has it, and it\u2019s an extra step to get everyone to download it. I also find that video files get compressed in WhatsApp and show up blurry. With iMessage, things look exactly how they were shot on my phone. I hate that the iPhone fans are right about this one because most of them haven\u2019t given Android a chance like I have, but they are. iMessage works so good and it\u2019s still not matched yet. 2. Ecosystem IntegrationYes, I own a MacBook Air, AirPods, and Apple Watch. They all work great, and they\u2019ve all become routine parts of my life. This is far less important to me than iMessage\/Facetime though. I could probably find some other earphones or smartwatch that I like on Android. 3. App SupportApps are generally prioritized for the iPhone, and years ago I would see countless examples of an iPhone app running smoother than its Android counterpart. Not sure if that\u2019s still the case.4. Apple PayAlways works flawlessly. Reasons I absolutely LOVE Android:1. Customization - Self explanatory 2. Freedom - I love how an Android device feels more like a computer. Mostly with file management, side loading capabilities etc. I just feel like where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way on these phones. 3. Hardware choice - This isn\u2019t as important to me because I almost always have opted for Samsung or Pixel devices, but usually Samsung. The Pixels feel too iPhoney to me. 4. Cool Factor - There\u2019s just always a cool party trick you can do with your Android that you can\u2019t with your iPhone "},"1520":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1521":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1528":{"post_title":"Why people don't use KDE Connect?

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1534":{"post_title":"Would love to hear your experiences with Motorola!

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1536":{"post_title":"The Google Weather app for Wear OS now has a more detailed forecast tile","self_text":""},"1537":{"post_title":"Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions","self_text":"I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https:\/\/oukitel.com\/products\/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the \"Force full GNSS measurements\" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood\/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs.

This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends\/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided \"No Samsung\" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's \"Smart Panel\" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic.

Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1548":{"post_title":"Real-life pictures and specs of Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL","self_text":""},"1549":{"post_title":"Pixel 9 Pro XL is one of the top 10 premium phones in the US","self_text":""},"1550":{"post_title":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\"","self_text":"Gemini Nano won't be coming to the Pixel 8 because of \"some hardware limitations\" but will be coming to more high-end devices in the near future according to Terence Zhang, a Developer Relations engineer at Google, [during #TheAndroidShow](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pou4o1X1DI4).The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have the same chipset (Tensor G3) but different amounts of memory (8GB versus 12GB).

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model. The Galaxy S25+ starts at $999.99 for the 256GB storage model.

My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal.

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now.

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD\/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"},"1592":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1593":{"post_title":"How I Organized My Google Pixel 9 Home Screens for Functionality and Aesthetic (Only Using It's Internal Settings, No Screen-Apps)","self_text":"My Google Pixel 9 layout is meticulously designed to reflect my needs, interests, and a desire for clean, purposeful organization.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1597":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help!

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "},"1600":{"post_title":"Android should really change how it works","self_text":"As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn\u2019t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting\u2014the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument."},"1601":{"post_title":"Moto Tag vs Chipolo One Point initial comparison","self_text":"Just received my FMD Moto tags and thought I'd share my initial observations.Moto Tag* Looks and feels slightly better quality, and certainly a much better colour choice.* Quite a bit smaller than the Chipolo (although a similar size in the case I chose).* Ability to adjust the ring volume of the tag within the Google FMD app (although high volume sounds quite a bit quieter then the Chipolo).* Has it's own companion app and the ability to update the FW of the tag. You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"1602":{"post_title":"Finally got a Desktop Mode working!!","self_text":"Thanks to the new version of scrcpy and Android 15!

I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"},"1604":{"post_title":"Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25","self_text":"Alongside updates to [Gemini](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/) and [Circle to Search](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https:\/\/www.resound.com\/en-us\/) and [Oticon Intent](https:\/\/www.oticon.com\/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions.

Whatever corners are cut to keep pricing competitive also affect it. On top of it, smartphone reviewers don't usually talk much about longevity of the phone model.  So, for someone getting a phone for long term usage, what are the things to look out for. It makes sense that flagships usually last longer due to better materials, more care and longer software support, but these things apply to mid-range as well as low-range phone.  I am listing some things that I can think of. Please add on to this list, and let me know if I added something wrong.  1. Overheating issues - Phones that run hot are bound to damage its internal components faster, so should check that it should not have overheating problems. Also, maybe not use phone while charging?2. Ingress Protection - Accidents are likely to happen over years of usage, some amount of water\/dust protection helps.3. Software support - Security updates and bug fixes are crucial although Android updates would be a plus. Can someone list out the brands which have better software support right now (quick bug fixes, security patches)4. Planned Obsolescence from brands - Do Android brands push updates to their older phones to make it less usable? Can someone comment on this, is it legit or conspiracy.5. Chipset and RAM - Probably consider at least a mid-range chipset (someone in the comments can suggest what's the minimum to go for?) and higher RAM variant.6. Battery Protection - Battery will degrade over-time, nothing can prevent that. But some brands have battery protection features built into their software, you should look for those and keep them on.7.  Custom ROM Support - Custom ROMs can extend the life of a device by years past its software support. Should consider a Qualcomm chipset if you're up for it. Are there other things that affect Custom ROM support except chip, like do some brands make it easier to flash a custom ROM, can someone suggest in comments?8. Build issues -  Usually phones these days don't have major design flaws, just something to keep in mind. Also, can someone comment on foldables, I know that at least Samsung has improved a lot on its foldable design but is it reached to a point that its comparable to bar phones, both display and hinge.9. Display issues - Check up if that particular device has display issues from other users online.10. Recent connectivity standards - For now, maybe look for 5G, but in general the newer Bluetooth\/WiFi\/Mobile standard, the better.11. Service Centers - Claim extended warranty if available, and check to make sure you have service centers within comfortable distance near you."},"1607":{"post_title":"Xiaomi 13T Pro Review (South Europe) ","self_text":"Backstory: I was an iPhone guy for a well until I enlisted in the army and decided to get a cheap phone with me because in training especially I was afraid I would break the expensive iPhone. Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1608":{"post_title":"Motorola Edge 50 Ultra mini-review","self_text":"Hey all,First of all, I am returning the phone as I prefer my Pixel 7 Pro, mostly for the cameras.Had the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra (Nordic wood) for a few days and just wanted to write a little about it since I can't see much about this phone out there and maybe it'll help someone.The phone feels good in hand, it's a bit narrower than the Pixel 7 Pro, but also lighter (due to the 4500mah battery probably). But the wooden back looks amazing! And it's very light.The screen curve is a bit too much for me, much curvier than on the pixel, but you get used to it.The case that comes with it is ok, doesn't cover the sides of the phone and it is a bit slippery.The fingerprint reader is optical, I would say on par with the Pixel 7 Pro.I've noticed a few stutters here and there, but had the first update yesterday and this seems to have helped with that a little!As for the camera, I was actually kinda impressed with it but at the same time there are some issues.

This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends\/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided \"No Samsung\" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's \"Smart Panel\" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."},"1613":{"post_title":"One thing I love about the new pixel update","self_text":"For TalkBack users that use pixel devices, the new pixel update now will tell you where to move your finger if you are trying to authenticate with the fingerprint sensor, and your finger is not on the fingerprint sensor.

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"1616":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1617":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"1621":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now.

Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me \/ Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP\/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?"},"1623":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"1624":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions.

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1628":{"post_title":"What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?","self_text":"I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI\/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit\/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit\/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI\/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in \"flagship\" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the \"old\" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the \"normal\" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water\/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \\*trying\\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have \"extra space\" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a \"flagship\" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit\/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit\/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit\/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a \"flagship\" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for \"security concerns\" (which are valid, except that these \"security concerns\" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta\/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN\/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN\/password is entered, the orientation\/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often\/with what parameters you need to use a PIN\/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI\/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom\/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom\/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel), navigation bars, \"recent apps\" screens, or other integral UI\/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called \"navbar\") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show\/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides\/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel) (the app I use is called \"oneshade\") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \\*mostly\\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \\*can\\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort\/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point\/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a \"flagship\" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with \"flagship\" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a \"flagship\" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior\/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the \"solution\" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory \"capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first\" to the theory of \"this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things\" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules\/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."},"1629":{"post_title":"What I miss as a new Pixel user - Any suggestions?","self_text":"I am new to Pixel and recently got a new Pixel 8a, and generally, I love it. It's extremely smooth and fast in comparison to my aging Oppo A91. However, there are a couple of features that I wish Google could bring from their rivals:1. **Floating windows.** This is perhaps, the feature that I miss the most. I have never enjoyed the experience of splitting the screen in two. It might be useful in some cases, but Oppo nailed it perfectly, you have two options, the small version (a preview) and the larger one where you can interact. I read that we might have a Bubble for all in Android 16, I cross the fingers it comes since it might be a good beginning.2. **Scheduling when to turn on\/off the device.** This probably should be added to the Digital Wellbeing app since some features are already there.3. **Showing the mega\/giga bytes consumed per day.** I was thinking it could be next to the toggle. (I wish one day, we would have the buttons split again).4. **Configurable three-finger swipe or double-tap gestures.**\u00a0This will be nice to have.Also, I have a question: Do you know if it's possible to group notifications from one app?

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"1641":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1642":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release. I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3.

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1644":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1648":{"post_title":"My wish list for the perfect phone","self_text":"6.2\" size120 Hz bright LTPO OLED s24 antiglare screen glassOnePlus 13 Aqua Touch 2.0camera and processing from Pixel pro 9 video quality of the iPhone 16 prosnapdragon 8 elite chip 16gb of fast ram6000+ mAh battery 512, 1000 and 2000gb for storage options (ufs4)USB 4 and 75watt fast chargingQi2 charging but 25wattshoulder buttons for shortcuts and emulationface and fingerprint unlock"},"1649":{"post_title":"Android VS iPhone.

Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life \/ wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life\/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean\/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc \/ payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good.

Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings.

If they don't, they're going to be too far away and outdated compared to the competition. For example, Google with the Pixel 9 updated all its camera sensors and now all the sensors in the Pixels are 50 Megapixels; for example, the main sensor of the camera went from being a Samsung GN2 sensor to the new Samsung GNK.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point.

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."},"1653":{"post_title":"Xiaomi 14 Pro is an extremely underrated phone.","self_text":"I sell phones as a little side hustle and get to try all the top Flagships in the United States.

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1656":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1658":{"post_title":"Pebblebee Card for Android review in Japan","self_text":"I recently bought a Pebblebee Card from the Google Store here in Japan.

The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

This could be a serious security issue because, in case of theft, the first thing a thief would do is try to disable the phone\u2019s connection, making it impossible to locate the device.Talking about this with some friends who own Pixel 7 and 8, we noticed that **in previous versions, this was not allowed**. For instance, if you tried to turn off the mobile network, the system would request fingerprint authentication, **just as it still does today when attempting to disable GPS**.Similarly, with previous versions, you had to **unlock the device to turn it off**. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case in the latest version.I understand that a thief could still hold down the power and volume button to force a shutdown, achieving the same result. However, in my opinion, **Android should discourage unauthorized users from accessing sensitive settings as much as possible**.**My dream is to have an OS that either prevents or allows users to choose which settings can be changed while the screen is locked.** Additionally, a system that blocks shutdowns (even forced ones) when the screen is locked would be ideal. This way, if the smartphone is stolen, it would be much harder to stop the device from being located, especially when using an eSIM.*My version: AP4A.250105.002.A1*"},"1665":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1666":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release.

The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"1667":{"post_title":"It's 2024 and Google messages still lacks basic functionality","self_text":"I got a new Samsung phone recently and the default messaging app was Google messages surprisingly. I used it for awhile, enjoying the new features. But then I found out I can't select text in a text message? Fucking what? Turns out this has been an issue for pixel enjoyers for a long time. Being able to select text in a text message is basic MVP functionality, and Google still hasn't implemented it. Thank God for android and being able to switch messaging apps. I'd be losing my fucking mind otherwise lol. Samsung messages also allows you to create folders, which is so handy for separating spam\/auto messages from important numbers.

"},"1668":{"post_title":"Moved from Android to iOS - An underwhelming experience so far [A use case based assessment]","self_text":"I recently switched from an android (One Plus) to ios (iphone 15). While I was aware of several physical limitations like slow charging, 60Hz refresh rate and notch(dynamic island), I always believed that iphone's true magic was its usability. However, using it for few days has made me realize how underwhelming iOS is in terms of basic functionalities. This was definitely not what I expected from an enterprise that prides itself on being design centric. That's why I am writing this use case based assessment of iOS and iphone comparing it with similar functionalities in Android so that anyone thinking about making the switch can make an informed decision.Usecase 1) -\u00a0**Segregating Volume levels of app notifications and call ringtone -**\u00a0I get maybe more than 50 notifications a day. While at work, having loud notification alerts becomes irritating. So, on android(One plus) I used to keep my notification volume low so that it doesn't become jarring to my colleagues. However, I still kept my call ringtone volume high so that I don't miss the 1-2 important calls that I get everyday on an average. To state the requirement explicitly, I want the notifications to be loud enough to be audible to me only (when I am with the phone) but I want the call ringtone to be loud enough to be audible from few metres away.\u00a0***This does not seem to be possible on iOS.***\u00a0I don't think this is something that is unique to me. Most folks get a lot of notifications on several apps but rarely get any calls. It seems absurd to group the volume levels of these two functionalities.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support thread -\u00a0[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/254940088?sortBy=best&page=1)Usecase 2) -\u00a0**Standardized gestures to move back -**\u00a0iOS implements gestures in an 'interesting' way. In most cases within an app, you can use gestures to go back to previous page\/screen. However, when it comes to opening another app within an app(like opening webpage from an app), you would have to click on the button at the top left corner of the screen to go back to the previous app. This I feel is a downgrade from how it is handled in Android. On Android, you swipe right to back to previous screen\/window irrespective of whether its within the same app or moving to another app.Usecase 3) -\u00a0**Selecting files\/images -**\u00a0Selecting multiple images\/files is a very common activity on mobile phones. On my One Plus phone, I could simply long press any file to bring selection option wherein I can select multiple files. But on iphone, I have to go to the top of the screen to enable this option. This seems pretty unintuitive and requires extra effort on part of user to enable a functionality.Usecase 4) -\u00a0**Blocking spam message senders -**\u00a0Most of us get probably dozens of spam\/marketing messages on our mobile phones from Banks\/Telecom providers etc. Blocking these senders should be effortless. On One Plus, I could use the same functionality that I had mentioned in last usecase i-e I could simple long press a message and a contextual menu used to pop up which had the option of adding the contact in to block list. On iOS, I have to open the message by clicking on it and then click on the sender icon, click on info and then click Block Caller to stop these spam messages. This seems like a lot of work.Usecase 5) -\u00a0**View images\/documents on Files app -**\u00a0Now, this isn't a design issue per se. The files app seems to be working perfectly fine for most folks. However, many people have reported that their Files app freezes especially if they are trying to open big files. For me the issue is with transferred pictures from my old phone. Whenever, I am trying to open the pictures on Files app, the app freezes without any warning. I don't think the files are corrupted as I can view the images fine on the Photos app.Here's a discussion about this on Apple support page -\u00a0[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/255068777?sortBy=best](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/255068777?sortBy=best)It seems to be happening on ipads as well.So, the general claim that Apple products just seem to work is untrue at least from what I have observed after using iOS for few days. Iphone 15 was my first apple product and its most likely is going to be my last as well. Its not that the iphone is very bad or unusable. It does the work for most part but then a mid range android also does that. I don't see why I should be paying a premium price for this experience. "},"1669":{"post_title":"OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3","self_text":"*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn't published this press release anywhere, so I'm pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  ---  *Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google***New York, NY, February 18, 2025** \u2013 Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology. While the previous generation set a new standard for battery life, battery performance remains a top priority for our users, as prolonged usage impacts the effective and accurate tracking of data. That's why we've raised the bar, offering improved battery life to meet the evolving demands of our community. We have also introduced a 60s Health Check-in, a quick and easy way to perform basic health monitoring. With enhanced health monitoring, advanced fitness tracking and unstoppable battery, the OnePlus Watch 3 is the ultimate companion for a healthier lifestyle.\u201d \u2013 said **Justin Liu, Head of Wearable Product Line, OnePlus.****Dual-Engine Architecture, Long-Lasting Battery Life**OnePlus Watch 3 pushes the limits in both battery life and performance. It lasts up to 3 days in heavy-use mode, up to 5 days in smart mode, and an impressive 16 days in power-saving mode (1,2,3).This has been made possible due to several factors. Firstly, the battery capacity has been increased to 631mAh. Secondly, the battery itself is a OnePlus Silicon NanoStack Battery, which is the same groundbreaking technology used in the latest flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13. This provides a significant boost in energy density while maintaining a slim design. The OnePlus Watch 3 also comes with the all-new BES2800 chipset, built on advanced 6nm FinFET, delivering an overall improvement in CPU performance and in NPU processing power compared to its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life.Furthermore, OnePlus' self-developed Dual-Engine Architecture, powered by two separate flagship chipsets \u2014 the **Snapdragon W5** performance chipset and the new **BES2800 MCU Efficiency** chipset, also plays its part. The BES2800 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 manages powerful tasks, such as running Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface, allows OnePlus Watch 3 to seamlessly switch between the two wearable operating systems and chipsets. This architecture strikes the perfect synergy of hardware and software, elevating the OnePlus Watch 3 to new levels of performance, efficiency, and endurance.**Health Tracking Made Simple and Smart**OnePlus Watch 3 brings additional upgrades to its health monitoring capabilities. A key highlight of the device is the 60S Health Check-In, a fast and convenient tool for a quick health assessment. By simply pressing your finger on the All-in-One Scan button located on the side of the watch, you can receive a detailed health report in just 60 seconds (6,9). This report includes six important health metrics, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (7). Vascular health (7)is a fundamental health indicator, enabling users to easily compare their vascular condition with age-based benchmarks.In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 introduces \"360 Mind and Body\", a feature that empowers users to gain a better understanding of their physical and mental well-being through multi-dimensional data analysis. Utilizing key metrics such as HRV (Heart Rate Variability), resting heart rate, and activity intensity, OnePlus Watch 3 employs advanced health algorithms to analyze the data trends and deliver a comprehensive assessment of emotional and stress levels. The watch's intuitive interface features a dynamic emoji that reflects the user's mind and body states, encouraging balance and a healthier lifestyle.**Enhanced Fitness Monitoring**OnePlus Watch 3 supports over 100 sports modes including running, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking, skiing, tennis, badminton, table tennis, soccer, basketball, boxing, and yoga, catering to diverse fitness needs. It also includes 11 professional modes for more comprehensive data tracking, such as an upgraded running mode, which monitors performance and posture across various running scenarios. In addition, OnePlus Watch 3 evaluates fat and carbohydrate consumption in heart rate zones, providing detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. This helps users manage exercise intensity, stay within optimal ranges, and fine-tune workouts for safe, effective results. By understanding fat and carb usage, users can better evaluate workout efficiency, especially for weight-loss-focused exercises.**Seamless ecosystem integration with Wear OS 5**The OnePlus Watch 3 runs the latest version of Wear OS, which brings updates to essential Google apps. Users can also seamlessly connect their watch to a new phone without resetting. Gmail on WearOS 5 now supports email sync and reply functions, making it easier to handle emails. Google Wallet now supports boarding passes, making travel more convenient (8,9, 10).**Effortless connectivity within the OnePlus ecosystem.**When paired with the OnePlus smartphones, the OnePlus Watch 3 can also be used to remotely control OnePlus phones to play videos (supports Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts), as well as the phone's camera (11,12).**Premium Design and Military-Grade Durability**The OnePlus Watch 3 boasts a sleek round design, crafted from durable stainless steel for a classic and premium look. Its Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel adds a polished shine while offering excellent corrosion resistance. The 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display is made of 2D Sapphire Crystal, ensuring superior durability for everyday wear and providing a brighter screen. Built to the MIL-STD-810H military standard, the watch can endure challenging conditions and environmental stress. With an IP68 rating (13) and 5ATM (14) water resistance, it performs reliably whether you're at the beach, in the desert, or swimming.**Price and Availability**The OnePlus Watch 3 is priced as $329.99 USD\/CAD$449.99, and it will be available to purchase in North America through OnePlus.com starting February 25, with pre-orders beginning on February 18.Warranty plans and after-sales programs are subject to terms and conditions specific to the region of purchase.OnePlus.com USA: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)OnePlus.com Canada: [https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3](https:\/\/www.oneplus.com\/ca_en\/buy-oneplus-watch-3)**###****About OnePlus**OnePlus is a global mobile technology brand that challenges conventional concepts of technology.

The content remains the same\u2014just easier to follow. If you would rather see my poorly written review DM me lol. Original post:I was initially skeptical of the widespread criticism surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but after receiving my 1TB model, I quickly understood the frustration. I had planned to trade in my Galaxy S22 for $600, expecting a substantial upgrade. However, after testing the S25 Ultra, I found the differences to be minimal\u2014certain aspects even felt like a downgrade.Underwhelming Improvements for a Premium PriceWith a starting price of $1,400, I expected significant enhancements, but the S25 Ultra left me unimpressed. The phone doesn\u2019t feel noticeably faster, and the cameras actually seem to perform worse than previous models. The macro photography, which I was particularly excited about, was a letdown\u2014my old Note 5 captured better close-up shots. Additionally, Samsung removed Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, reducing its versatility.Samsung\u2019s AI Promises Were MisleadingSamsung heavily marketed AI as the defining feature of the S25 Ultra, claiming during its launch event that all AI processing could be done locally on the device. This turned out to be misleading. Even after enabling the \"local AI\" setting to keep data on-device, I found that many features still required cloud access to function. This raises privacy concerns and contradicts Samsung\u2019s core marketing message.AI and Image Generation Fell FlatBeyond the misleading AI claims, the phone\u2019s generative image features were disappointing. Samsung positioned AI as the main selling point of the S25 Ultra, yet the execution feels rushed and underdeveloped. Instead of true AI innovation, it seems like Samsung is simply riding the AI hype train without delivering a meaningful user experience.Not Enough to Justify the Price TagAt $1,400 and up, the S25 Ultra needed to bring substantial improvements, but it doesn\u2019t. This release feels more like an incremental iPhone-style update\u2014something unexpected from Samsung, which was once known for pushing boundaries. Rather than innovating, they seem to be cutting corners while relying on AI buzzwords.For the first time ever, I\u2019m returning a Samsung device.

I\u2019ve spent years on both Android and iOS, but I\u2019ve leaned more towards iOS is the past 5 years for sure. The reason I ask is because Android is starting to intrigue me again after being on iOS this long. I\u2019ve used both extensively over the years, and I really miss playing around with my phone and truly making it mine, mostly with Nova Launcher, icon packs and wallpapers. But, there\u2019s reasons why Apple does so well. For me, it\u2019s utility. My phone is a communication device well before it\u2019s a toy these days, and in recent years I\u2019ve just felt that the iPhone does a better job at communication (iMessage being a huge deal breaker for me). I was a big BlackBerry fan before this, that\u2019s how important communication was to me. In fact, one of the last Android devices I had was the BlackBerry Key2. The physical keyboard had so many functional benefits. Anyways, here\u2019s my brief list for why I\u2019ve stayed with my iPhone in recent years. Please feel free to share why you agree or disagree, I low key want to be persuaded into getting an S24 Ultra \ud83d\ude021. iMessageEasily the biggest reason. Some people don\u2019t see it as a big deal, I do. I live in Canada. Almost everyone I know has an iPhone. I hate when I text someone with a green bubble. It\u2019s like, did they get my message? Can I send them the video I just took of my dog without it looking choppy? Oh it\u2019s a 1 minute video, ya forget it. Oh I wanna FaceTime my friend quick\u2026 oh wait, they\u2019re the green bubble friend, never mind. Okay I need to start a group chat to plan my dad\u2019s 60th birthday party. Oh wait, that friend I have to text separately. There\u2019s so many reasons why iMessage is great! Yes, WhatsApp works great, but not everyone has it, and it\u2019s an extra step to get everyone to download it. I also find that video files get compressed in WhatsApp and show up blurry. With iMessage, things look exactly how they were shot on my phone. I hate that the iPhone fans are right about this one because most of them haven\u2019t given Android a chance like I have, but they are. iMessage works so good and it\u2019s still not matched yet. 2. Ecosystem IntegrationYes, I own a MacBook Air, AirPods, and Apple Watch. They all work great, and they\u2019ve all become routine parts of my life. This is far less important to me than iMessage\/Facetime though. I could probably find some other earphones or smartwatch that I like on Android. 3. App SupportApps are generally prioritized for the iPhone, and years ago I would see countless examples of an iPhone app running smoother than its Android counterpart. Not sure if that\u2019s still the case.4. Apple PayAlways works flawlessly. Reasons I absolutely LOVE Android:1. Customization - Self explanatory 2. Freedom - I love how an Android device feels more like a computer. Mostly with file management, side loading capabilities etc. I just feel like where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way on these phones. 3. Hardware choice - This isn\u2019t as important to me because I almost always have opted for Samsung or Pixel devices, but usually Samsung. The Pixels feel too iPhoney to me. 4. Cool Factor - There\u2019s just always a cool party trick you can do with your Android that you can\u2019t with your iPhone "},"1672":{"post_title":"How to convince google to be serious about biometric authentication to stop thieves?","self_text":"I'm from Brazil and thieves force you to tell your PIN with a gun to your head then take your phone. Android always allows for the fingerprint to be bypassed by the PIN so there's no way to protect from this. Also they get into your messaging apps and start asking relatives for money, not to mention looking for photos for extortion. People's bank accounts are being drained. Android Identity Check is nice but much more needs to be done to enforce biometric only unlock of the phone and let people lock apps with biometric authentication easily. But most importantly, it needs to be convenient otherwise people will not use for everyday apps like Whatsapp.On iOS it's possible to lock all apps with Face ID which is more convenient because you can switch between them all day and you don't even notice face id is there. On Android people would only lock some apps but today our information is all in WhatsApp which no one would put behind a fingerprint because they use it all day. Android should use AI to detect faces if it does not want to include 3D face scanning like Face ID, but it needs it.Also apps should be able to enforce biometric only authentication if they want, something which is not possible today. Also prevent phone calls to be answered with the phone locked as 2FA codes can be received over phone calls.  Android meeds much better al security against thieves by enforcing biometric only authentication but google seems to not care much about this, or maybe manufacturers as well ehich never implemented face scanning technology. Is there a way to convince google? Samsung? Can this reach a google employee eith power to change?"},"1673":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all.

During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

OxygenOS 15 comes with a split notification and Quick Settings panels, but you\u2019re given the choice to use the new Split UI or the Classic UI! I\u2019ve grown fond of the split shade in recent weeks since it lets me see more of both, plus it\u2019s easy to switch between the two.2) More muted icon colors. Instead of having really colorful icons everywhere, OxygenOS 15 uses monochrome icons by default in the Quick Settings and [Settings home page](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgMjRXAAAEZRD?format=jpg&name=large) that look less noisy. You can still change the system colors under Wallpapers & style, though!3) Circle to Search, my beloved!

There are also now new fade-in\/fade-out transition animations when going between the AOD to the lock screen to the home screen.5) Open Canvas is available on phones now! This feature made it possible on the Open and Pad to multitask between 3 different apps in split-screen instead of only 2. On phones, Open Canvas makes it easier to switch between apps while multitasking.  6) You can now share files more easily with your iPhone friends. The new [Share with iPhone feature](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgcS9WYAAg23q?format=jpg&name=large) lets you transfer files to iPhone users without you needing to download an app, though your friends will have to download the O+ Connect app.7) New AI photo features, like AI Unblur, AI Reflection Eraser, and AI Detail Boost. AI Unblur removes motion blur from photos (including old ones), [AI Reflection Eraser](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Gaqgf6rWEAAP7l_?format=jpg&name=large) gets rid of reflections of glass\/windows in photos, and [AI Detail Boost](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgiNWWYAA8X2P?format=jpg&name=large) applies superresolution after you crop into a photo.8) New AI features for note-taking and messaging. [AI Assistant for Notes](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GaqgkbTXgAAGao3?format=jpg&name=large) can format, clean up (filler speech), polish (the copy of the content), continue writing (long text based on your inputs), elaborate (expand your points into usable paragraphs), shorten (takes long text and summarizes it). AI Reply automatically analyzes on-screen content and generates replies in different tones in IM apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. In addition you can write your own texts and generate refined replies.9) OnePlus OneTake lets you create beautiful personalized wallpapers of your pets. It\u2019ll take a photo of a pet with a noisy background, cut out the pet from the photo, and put it into a neat visual frame.10) Intelligent Search. This feature is coming to the next flagship (ie. OnePlus 13), and it\u2019ll basically let you ask questions like \u201chow much is my next phone bill?\u201d and then it\u2019ll perform a deep search of all your local files to extract that information and use AI to generate a response.OnePlus also touted Theft Protection as an OxygenOS 15 feature during the briefing\u2026but honestly it seems like it\u2019s just the same Theft Protection feature that rolled out to all Android users recently?

Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.- Excellent phone reception and sound quality\/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3\/4\/5G to boost your base voice call quality too- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour- While Samsung S24 series have \"circle to search\", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera\/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)However, here's the bits that could be better:- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications - Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer\/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get."},"1681":{"post_title":"Why is it that almost everyone who uses Android phones doesn't know about \"Quick Share\"?","self_text":"Let me explain, everyone, absolutely everyone who uses an iPhone knows that their devices have an option to send and receive things that is called, in Apple's case, \"Air Drop\". On Android we have something similar called \"Quick Share\" but nobody knows about it, nobody knows that they can send and receive things through it; in fact I even hear some people say things like \"I wish Android had its own \"Air Drop\"I think this happens because Apple is very good at publicizing the features and functions of its products but Google and other Android brands do not know how to do it as well, they have to better advertise the functions of their products; and this not only happens with Quick Share, but with other functions such as Circle to Search on the Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S22 and higher that even if everyone has their phones updated and with all those functions, they do not know that they have them and therefore do not use them."},"1682":{"post_title":"The Pixel Launcher is starting to roll out a new \"search engine\" settings page","self_text":"This page lets you change the search provider used for the search bar on the home screen.One user tells me they received a notification from the Search Engine Selector app to choose their search engine.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1684":{"post_title":"My experience with the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem","self_text":"I was curious how well the integrations between phone and laptop would work, so I decided to test all of the relevant ecosystem apps and features. I\u2019ve included a description of each app\/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn\u2019t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn\u2019t able to get notes to sync reliably. It\u2019s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can\u2019t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn\u2019t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/office\/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn\u2019t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It\u2019s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn\u2019t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn\u2019t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google\u2019s desktop Quick Share app](https:\/\/www.android.com\/intl\/en_ca\/better-together\/quick-share-app\/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there\u2019s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren\u2019t. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It\u2019s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on\/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works. It makes sense since those are all Chromium-based browsers."},"1685":{"post_title":"My wish list for the perfect phone","self_text":"6.2\" size120 Hz bright LTPO OLED s24 antiglare screen glassOnePlus 13 Aqua Touch 2.0camera and processing from Pixel pro 9 video quality of the iPhone 16 prosnapdragon 8 elite chip 16gb of fast ram6000+ mAh battery 512, 1000 and 2000gb for storage options (ufs4)USB 4 and 75watt fast chargingQi2 charging but 25wattshoulder buttons for shortcuts and emulationface and fingerprint unlock"},"1686":{"post_title":"Android VS iPhone.

Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life \/ wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life\/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean\/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc \/ payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try. We'll just have to take her word for this \ud83e\udd23 ## Problem 3 workaround I have added a lock screen shortcut onto the home screen so even when it's locked you can click wallet. # 4When she listens to her Bluetooth headphones audiobooks at night, just before she falls asleep, she simply presses and holds the power button and you can hear them say power off. Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue.

Make the first notification sound when user unlocks the phone and then if he still watches the screen\/holds the phone (it has sensors for that yet ironically unused in cases like these which would have been most important for UX but apparently they prefer to use them mostly as telemetry data for ads...:\/ ) then just buz the vibration a little bit and show the other notifications incoming graphically.....    Like I watch the phone right now, I operate it! I dont need 100 notification sounds busting my ears... I see them incoming that's enough I got notified ! lol     Also when watching something on full screen or writing a message etc it should PRIORITIZE use cases, user watching movie? we just buzz not play notification sounds same if user types a message....     I know there is an option **to disable notifications** for a while     **but I WANT them**! It is not that I want to disable them.       like I want to know if there an incoming message or a friend request etc I just dont need to have them all play in serial and simultaneously the notification sound......

I live in the USA and therefore here the Galaxy of the series \"S\" are all released with the Snapdragon of the series 8 of the year; that means that the Galaxy S25 here will come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 with its new Oryon cores  The Galaxy S25 strikes me to buy them as they will use those new Snapdragon with totally new architecture, but it is not the only change I expect. since the S22, the 3 sensors of the camera have not changed at all and all the improvements have come via processing and software, but there are already 3 generations with the same camera sensors and it would be ridiculous from my point of view that they did not update them for the new S25 and S25 Plus. If they don't, they're going to be too far away and outdated compared to the competition. For example, Google with the Pixel 9 updated all its camera sensors and now all the sensors in the Pixels are 50 Megapixels; for example, the main sensor of the camera went from being a Samsung GN2 sensor to the new Samsung GNK. I think if the S25 and S25 Plus do not update at least the main sensor of the camera, I will not buy it. "},"1689":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"1691":{"post_title":"Google rolls out new accessibility features for Android, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25","self_text":"Alongside updates to [Gemini](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/gemini-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/) and [Circle to Search](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/circle-to-search-at-galaxy-unpacked-25\/), Google also unveiled new accessibility features coming to select Android devices, starting with Samsung's Galaxy S25 series.## Hearing aid support over Bluetooth LE AudioFor starters, Google says that it's launching LE Audio compatibility on the Galaxy S25, enabling hands-free calling and a low-latency connection to [GN ReSound](https:\/\/www.resound.com\/en-us\/) and [Oticon Intent](https:\/\/www.oticon.com\/) hearing aids. Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions. This feature is already available in Google's version of TalkBack for other Android devices."},"1692":{"post_title":"Here's everything that's new in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2","self_text":"# What's available right now  * The top-level Settings homepage redesign that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) is [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sWk5RxGP)  * The keyboard quick switcher feature that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-keyboard-switcher-revamp-3475688\/) is also [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sd0qyPhE)  * Another feature that [I previously reported on](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-screen-recording-chips-3474411\/) is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [new status bar chips for screen recording\/screen casting.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sp6myIx8)  * Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [partial\/compact heads-up notifications layout](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tMN0RLaH) that I [previously reported about!](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061\/)  * The [color correction intensity slider](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tg0dR7Da) that I [previously reported about](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-color-correction-slider-3458931\/) is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2!

My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI\/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit\/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit\/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI\/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in \"flagship\" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the \"old\" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the \"normal\" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water\/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \\*trying\\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have \"extra space\" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a \"flagship\" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit\/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit\/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit\/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a \"flagship\" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for \"security concerns\" (which are valid, except that these \"security concerns\" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta\/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN\/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN\/password is entered, the orientation\/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often\/with what parameters you need to use a PIN\/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI\/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom\/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom\/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel), navigation bars, \"recent apps\" screens, or other integral UI\/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called \"navbar\") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show\/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides\/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel) (the app I use is called \"oneshade\") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \\*mostly\\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \\*can\\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort\/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point\/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a \"flagship\" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with \"flagship\" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a \"flagship\" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior\/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the \"solution\" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory \"capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first\" to the theory of \"this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things\" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules\/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."},"1695":{"post_title":"2 things stopping me from switching to Android\n","self_text":"I am freaking tired of iPhone 11 pro max, the buggiest software I have ever used and the most annoying and difficult OS to use, also the phone doesn\u2019t catch proper signals, everyone keeps telling they are unable to call me many times.

I have backed up this image in both apps and if I search \"list\" or \"listen\" apple photos brings it up but google photos doesn't. weirdly gphotos can bring it up with word \"unlock\" so app is buggy or something. google only shows it when I search whole word \"listener\", I have many documents photos and cant switch without partial text search in photos. pixel 9 pro has screenshots app but I want it to search all kinds of photos not just screenshots. does any of your apps able to search this image by any partial word in it?https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yae8nz9h9k6e1.jpg?width=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93bad3f6ceb1497d9ac92ff7d6a66f174fa4e3d6Second is faceID: iPhone unlocks in total freaking darkness without blasting my face with light and also instantly and also works 100% of times without compromising security.

I don\u2019t want to use any method that\u2019s insecure. Pin and password can also be seen or recorded, now that there are cameras everywhere and phone stores all my money and I don\u2019t want to put it any risk so unlock method of phone and banking apps is very important.

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1700":{"post_title":"Combining Dynamic Island and Dynamic Spot is the best way to do floating notifications","self_text":"As a Xiaomi user, I'm not sure if this applies to all current Android skins, but the floating notifications are intrusive 99% of the time. I don't like the way that they auto-expand and take up a ton of screen real estate when I don't even want to read a message or notification yet (hence mostly disabling them, and just in case other people are around). Similar concept with bubbles where I don't like them constantly being on my screen, and I'd rather be in the in-app UI because I'll be opening the app anyway to read and reply.What I am interested in a lot of the time though is who the notifications are from, and from there I'd know if I want to read it or open it right away. The way that the Dynamic Spot app executes this is perfect in my opinion. When I get a message, I have it set to move out from my camera cutout to show the profile picture and app icon. This also works for my Twitter notifications and shows YouTube and Spotify thumbnails as they're playing, with a nice colored visualizer animation that really sets the tone. Add that to things like alarms, timers, other media players, and calls and you really have a formula to make floating notifications unintrusive (by keeping it in the status bar), functional, and visually pleasing. One of the best parts is that if there's nothing happening, you don't have a huge black bubble and it all goes back to a normal screen. Another is that you can choose whether you want the small island to auto-expand, and if not, easily tap to expand with options such as mark as read, reply, and control media. It's all so convenient and visually pleasing, which is something that's a bit lacking in just using the notification shade. I love the way that it uses the already black area of your screen and turns it into a living, breathing part of your phone (like iOS does). It also makes it easier to directly focus on and access one particular thing with just a tap rather than multiple swipes.While a lot of people call the iOS Dynamic Island gimmicky, I believe that it definitely has its uses such as timers, indicators, and pleasing animations, and combining that native implementation with the features, execution, and customization of Dynamic Spot would truly elevate it to something great on Android that makes a previously useless feature (for me) into my favorite way notifications are delivered. I know that they'll be implementing something similar in future Android versions with the pill, but I think the way it expands and blends with the camera is really a great way to do it, and I wouldn't mind copying it from iOS."},"1701":{"post_title":"Lock screen interactions on Android are clunky","self_text":"As an iOS user who's looking to replace an aging iPhone 11 soon, I am seriously considering the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 Pro. However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and *then* pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating."},"1702":{"post_title":"Pebblebee Card for Android review in Japan","self_text":"I recently bought a Pebblebee Card from the Google Store here in Japan.

Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: \"find nearby,\" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11).

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series. That means you can expect to receive up to Android 22 in 2031.## How much does the S25 series cost?The Samsung Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage model.

Modern smartphones have bigger sensors, and when they focus up close, due to the nature of the sensor there is more area that is blurred. The presence of blur is not the issue, in fact it is welcomed; it helps create a more immersive photo with the \"3D\" effect. The issue is the quality of the blur itself. I don't know if modern smartphone manufacturers cannot correct for distortions, or simply don't care and use really low quality of lenses, but the blur modern smartphones produce looks awful. Here is an example: I took [this photo](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/FmDcmQVn\/67-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-01.jpg) with the Pixel 8a (top), and the Lumia 950 (bottom). Check how bad the blur looks in the top image. If you don't know what to look for, [take a look at this](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/HHp5fLXy\/68-Pixel8a-vs-L950-Evaporating-Blur-2025-01-02-02.jpg), where I point it out. I don't know what the correct photography term is for this phenomena, but I call it the \"evaporating blur\". It is when the blurred subject, letters in this case, look like they are duplicated, ghosted, and are evaporating. As if Thanos just snapped his fingers. The amount of blurring between the two phones is actually about the same, but the Lumia's blur is much more pleasant. I created [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1hjoimf\/does_your_pixel_take_blurfree_pictures_of\/) on r\/GooglePixel recently where I asked if anybody else had issues taking blur-free photos of documents with their Pixels. The 8a has a bigger sensor than my previous 4a, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that I cannot take decent photos of documents due to a distortion in the lens. Here is an additional comparison between [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/R4Q65vLz\/19-Pixel-4a-Camera-PX-Automatic-mode.jpg), which does a much better job than the 8a, and [the Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mbhtHCfb\/20-s-Xf-Qr-St.jpg). If you check the top and the bottom of the 4a's sample, you can see that evaporating blur effect. The 950 looks tack sharp, edge-to-edge. More examples: [The 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/mTLcTKm1\/22-6osgj-C4.jpg), [The Lumia 950](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/RM8qQh4w\/23-qdp-RIJr.jpg). Take a look at the right side, the \"Phone camera direction\" text. One more example: [The Nokia 808 PureView](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/1zNmY0sw-\/25-in-Rt-T07.jpg), and [the 4a](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/fTBR3T8t\/24-l-HNs-K7d.jpg). You see how \"HERS\" in \"SKECHERS\" is being evaporated in the sample with the Pixel? It may look like I am nitpicking on the Pixels, but I am not, I am just a Pixel user and a fan, so I get to try them myself. All modern phones have this issue, at least I haven't come across one that had a truly nice blur. It's something I always pay attention to in reviews. [Here is an example with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/xiaomi-14-ultra\/camera\/gsmarena_1112.jpg), a premium camera flagship. Look at the right side of the image. [Another example](https:\/\/fdn.gsmarena.com\/imgroot\/reviews\/24\/vivo-x200-pro\/camera\/gsmarena_1107.jpg) with the vivo X200 Pro. iPhones have a very well known issue with [lens flares](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qJXXZMoeoeE). It is because they use low quality lenses. It's something that is still not fixed. I am surprised how Nokia's engineers were able to tune their lenses 10 years ago, yet in the modern day, with these premium, super expensive camera centric smartphones we don't have that. The point of this thread is to just discuss if anybody else is also bothered by this, maybe I am the only one. What are your thoughts on it? Maybe I can bring awareness, so others know about it, and start to get annoyed by it too, LOL."},"1709":{"post_title":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner : 8-months-in review ","self_text":"Day one Pixel 8 Pro owner here. Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1710":{"post_title":"Here's everything new (and upcoming) in Android 15 Beta 3","self_text":"Google released Android 15 Beta 3 yesterday, and as usual, I [did a deep dive](https:\/\/x.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1803141388696998188) into everything new I uncovered in the release.

[You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"1711":{"post_title":"OnePlus unveils its latest flagship smartwatch: OnePlus Watch 3","self_text":"*(For some reason, OnePlus hasn't published this press release anywhere, so I'm pasting what they sent me via email in its entirety here.)*  ---  *Offering exceptional battery life, new health monitoring capabilities and advanced fitness tracking, powered by Wear OS 5 by Google***New York, NY, February 18, 2025** \u2013 Global technology brand OnePlus today launched its latest flagship smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, in the United States and Canada. Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1713":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1714":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"1715":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal. "},"1716":{"post_title":"Android should really change how it works","self_text":"As indicated by the title, I strongly believe that Android should overhaul its overall functionality, particularly regarding UI and camera performance across various apps.Having used both Android and iPhone since 2018, I've owned a Nexus phone, switched to an iPhone 8, then to a Huawei Mate 20, iPhone 13 Pro, Pixel 8 Pro, and now I'm using an iPhone 15 Pro. Through these experiences, I've noticed distinct differences between the two platforms. I'm not here as an Apple fanboy, but rather as a disappointed Android user.Technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, providing us with greater computational power in our phones. However, the smoothness of Android UI still lacks at times, reminiscent of its laggy past, especially when compared to the fluidity of iOS. Although it's not as bad as it used to be, I still encounter occasional issues.This discrepancy seems to stem from how Android and iOS are programmed, with Android prioritizing background resources while iOS focuses more on the user interface. This paradigm needs to shift. It's unacceptable to have a phone with 8GB of RAM and a powerful processor, yet still experience stuttering.The issues don't end there; app designs on Android are often subpar, with many outdated designs that cheapen the user experience. While I understand it's challenging to cater to the vast array of Android devices, flagship phones should set a higher standard considering their premium price tags.Camera quality is also a concern, not the native camera app, but across various third-party apps. Should I really need to take a picture using the main camera app before sharing it on social media for decent quality? I recall using the Pixel 8 Pro and being disappointed with the image quality on Instagram, especially when using filters or the boomerang feature. It simply didn't compare to the quality of my girlfriend's iPhone 14 Pro Max, making the Pixel 8 Pro feel like a budget device.In 2024, smartphones have become ubiquitous, ingrained in our daily lives. They're more than just tools; they're an extension of ourselves. Therefore, Android should prioritize improving the user interface, as it's the first thing users interact with and crucial to the overall user experience.EDIT ( also in the comment ):As I read through all of your comments, I realized there was a lot of misunderstanding beneath my post. This isn\u2019t a battle between Android and iPhone; it's not about showcasing how superior the iPhone is, as I acknowledge the downsides of both Android and iPhone. I genuinely believe Android has the potential to be the best operating system on the market. It's amusing how some of you discuss the aesthetics of Apple versus Android's customizability and overall functionality. Firstly, comparing their appearance is subjective, and secondly, I'm not overly concerned about all the functionalities of Android. I'm speaking strictly about how most people use their phones. I don't see many heavily customized Android devices, nor do I witness the majority of Android users utilizing all the functionalities of their phones. However, issues like stuttering animations, third-party apps' usage of the Camera API, and preinstalled apps not matching the UI's overall style are the problems I'm highlighting\u2014the issues that basic users encounter with Android. If a feature is only utilized by a mere 5% of Android users, why bother commenting on it? Instead of addressing the topic at hand, most of you are bringing up unrelated matters that do not contribute to the argument."},"1717":{"post_title":"ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro - Buyer Beware","self_text":"Let me know if this needs to go elsewhere, but after doing quite a bit of searching here and across the web, there aren't many places to actually leave reviews for this device, including ASUS' own site. I have been an Android fan since sideloading 1.6 onto one of my windows mobile phones. I am pretty familiar with the ecosystem and have generally embraced the edges of the manufacturers as I like to tinker, but also have the expectation that things work. I bought the ASUS ROG Phone 8 Pro for the spec's and what it could bring to the table. I needed a daily driver device that could handle calling, presentations, games and not need a recharge before 10am.After owning the device for less than 6 months the following issues started to occur with it while using T-Mobile service  - Calls will drop immediately after placing them, the phone shows no service at all and seemingly is rebooting the modem or something, after 20 seconds then you can try to make the call again. This happens even with replacing the SIM with a new one, or swapping with the wife's SIM  - Data will drop in and out similar to the calls dropping out. When this occurs, no indication is there that the service has been disconnected. Service only works on what the phone labels as 5G +, 5g, 4g LTE and the like are spotty for even hoping for dialup speeds  - Callers on the other end complain of hearing a knocking or hammering noise periodically during calls. This takes place regardless of location or setting. The only time it doesn't happen is when using a bluetooth connection, so clearly whatever feedback within the device resonates through the mic's  - AI noise suppression no longer works, and seems to work backwards and increases background noise and decreases actual talking. At times calls will randomly sound muffled, and sadly this issue seems to have existed since day 1.   - Battery life already has fallen to the point that 1 day of operation with little to no gaming, is no longer sustainable. All while following all of their battery and charging protocols built into the device including scheduled charging and slow charging.  - Air Triggers are temperamental at best. HTC figured out the pressure frame thing about 7 years ago, and ASUS didn't spend much time improving the technology    These issues would be problematic on their own, but ASUS and their warranty process involves sending your device in for 2 weeks while they diagnose and repair your phone and then send it back. They have no means to provide or offer local servicing, and I live in Denver. I checked through other means and other cities, Phoenix, Salt Lake and the like don't have these options either. They don't have a provision or setup to issue a loaner device or anything like that or even coordinating with 3rd party repair centers... ( it seems that they do have a network of these using Microcenter and other retailers, but these services are really geared towards their PC market). For other types of devices, there might be other ways, but in the 21st century, operating without a mobile device for 2 weeks becomes problematic.     This post is after attempting several times to talk to someone about the issues and the problems with their warranty services. If this was a bargain basement device, expecting people to throw their SIM in another device for a time would be no big deal. But this is a 1000+ phone that they are comfortable in shaving 5% of your warranty period so they can fix the device with no recourse. Buyer beware, there are much better devices out there, for gaming or for calling. If this was Samsung or Apple, they would have the means to make things happen, but you can't even leave a review anywhere for the device, maybe that is a sign"},"1718":{"post_title":"This is the extent Apple went to, in order to make iOS UX what it is. And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1719":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!   "},"1720":{"post_title":"Oukitel C53 budget phone first impressions","self_text":"I have been using a [Oukitel C53](https:\/\/oukitel.com\/products\/c53) phone over the past few weeks, which I bought in a sort of emergency as my older Nokia 6 became suddenly unreliable (after 6 years of use).First of all, this is a budget phone, it cost me 72 euros to get, so it is obvious that some corners have been cut, e.g., no NFC, lack of compass, no 5G, no Wi-Fi 5, no Bluetooth 5, lower screen resolution than higher end models, does not break any speed records, and it has an 13MP camera.However, for the low price, the memory and storage combo of 4GB and 64GB respectively is more than decent, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 (I have Gorilla Glass 3 on my Nokia 6 and it has survived many drops), the performance is pretty good, the photos look lively, it can take a microSD card, it supports two SIM cards (which was important for me), it comes with Android 14, and the battery lasts quite a bit.**Small issues**There is a RAM extension feature that adds 4GB of storage to the 4GB of RAM for a total of 4GB + 4GB of RAM, but I have found this functionality to crash some GPS-based apps when I push them to the background (e.g., Geovelo), even when I give them permission to always remain active and never be stopped by the system; I am not sure if it is a problem with an app or the feature itself (or both), but I disabled this functionality and never had issues ever since.The GPS signal is slightly on the weak side; I went into the developer options and enabled the \"Force full GNSS measurements\" option, and things seem to have stabilized. Basically, I downloaded a GPS testing app, and although the device finds many satellites to choose from (around a dozen usually), the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is between 30 dB and 40 dB outside with a clear sky (slightly green) and the device needs 20 to 30 seconds to get a fix. That said, the phone comes with assisted GPS (A-GPS), so turning on mobile data or Wi-Fi to get an initial fix can improve performance.**Overall impression**I did not have time to look into all the different options that exist out there these days, and please be mindful of the fact that I have been using a Nokia 6 for the past 6 years, BUT I find this to be a very solid device for its price point. My typical use case is to record a bicycle ride with some GPS-based app for a couple of hours, text and browse a bit, make and answer a handful of short calls, and navigate myself in a new neighborhood\/city. With a full charge in the early morning, the battery goes down to around 20% by the evening of the next day, which more than covers my needs. If the GPS continues being reliable after my small changes, I think I will keep this as my main phone; originally I was thinking of just buying the cheapest option to get some things done and then have it as a backup phone."},"1721":{"post_title":"A few observations changing from Samsung to OnePlus","self_text":"In case it matters, I'm in the US.A week ago, I swapped from a Galaxy S22u to a OnePlus 12, both running Android 14. This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends\/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided \"No Samsung\" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's \"Smart Panel\" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock. I do understand that this may be coming to all devices, so here's hoping."},"1722":{"post_title":"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Review: The End of the Beginning - MrMobile","self_text":""},"1723":{"post_title":"Samsung just announced the Galaxy S25: Here's everything you need to know!","self_text":"At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.## DisplayThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

RCS Setup Issues on Pixel 9 Pro Fold (SOLVED!)","self_text":"Heads up, If you're on a Verizon business account and tearing your hair out trying to get RCS to work, I've got the solution.I was stuck in \"RCS setup\" limbo for weeks, tried every trick in the book, and was about to give up. Turns out, Verizon has a sneaky \"feature\" on their business accounts that **blocks RCS by default**.**The Fix:**1. Contact your Verizon business account admin.2. Have them log into the account dashboard.3. There's a setting called \"Block RCS\" (or something similar). **Make sure it's turned OFF.**Boom! RCS instantly connected for me after that. Hope this saves someone else the headache I went through.Edit: Sharing this as there is absolutely no information about this anywhere including Verizon support or Google support."},"1726":{"post_title":"Made by Google 2024 event mega thread","self_text":"[Keynote live stream ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N_y2tP9of8A)[The made by Google after party Livestream ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cWGt2ybsVMk)[Made by Google 2024 blog post](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/platforms-devices\/made-by-google-2024-collection\/)[Meet Pixel Buds Pro 2, the first Buds built for Gemini](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-buds-pro-2\/)[Introducing Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Google's newest foldable phone](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-pro-fold\/)[9 things to know about Pixel 9 cameras](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-ai-camera-features\/)[The new Pixel 9 phones bring you the best of Google AI](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-pro-xl\/)[Loss of Pulse Detection: A first-of-its-kind feature on Pixel Watch 3](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection\/)[Google Pixel Watch 3: bigger, brighter, fine-tuned for fitness](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-watch-3\/)[4 new AI-powered Pixel and Android accessibility updates](https:\/\/blog.google\/outreach-initiatives\/accessibility\/google-pixel-camera-accessibility-update-2024\/)[14 new things you can do with Pixel thanks to AI](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/pixel\/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features\/)[Android is reimagining your phone with Gemini](https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/android\/android-gemini-google-ai\/)***Pixel lineup:*****Pixel 9**[Google Pixel 9 unveiled: Here's all the details of the new Google phones - android faithful](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/google-pixel-9\/)[Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold: What a Gemini - Joshua Vergara](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uAs8iJoGDos)[Google Pixel 9 Pro: AI that ACTUALLY WORKS?

Building upon the impressive performance, long-lasting battery life, and premium design of its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 3 takes it a step further. Powered with the latest version of Wear OS by Google (Wear OS 5), the smartwatch offers 16-day battery life in power saver mode, 5-day battery life in smart mode, and is able to reach a full day of use in an incredibly fast 10-minute (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The watch will also bring new health monitoring capabilities, including the 60s Health Check-In (6), which tracks six key health metrics like heart rate, SpO2, vascular health (7), wrist temperature, sleep, and both physical and mental wellbeing.Thanks to a new dual-frequency GPS (GNSS) chip, fitness tracking is enhanced with improved accuracy when engaging in outdoor activities such as running. The watch also supports over 100 sports modes, and provides detailed insights into fat-burning efficiency, workout intensity, and exercise effectiveness. Available in two stunning colors \u2013 Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, the premium design is incredibly durable due toa stainless-steel body, titanium PVD bezel and 2D sapphire crystal display. For the first time, a functional rotating crown has been added for convenient control of various functions, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions.\u201cThe OnePlus Watch 3 is a true embodiment of our Never Settle philosophy, reflecting our unwavering dedication to advancing wearable technology.

There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1729":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1730":{"post_title":"Here's everything that's new in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2","self_text":"# What's available right now  * The top-level Settings homepage redesign that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) is [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sWk5RxGP)  * The keyboard quick switcher feature that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-keyboard-switcher-revamp-3475688\/) is also [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sd0qyPhE)  * Another feature that [I previously reported on](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-screen-recording-chips-3474411\/) is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [new status bar chips for screen recording\/screen casting.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sp6myIx8)  * Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [partial\/compact heads-up notifications layout](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tMN0RLaH) that I [previously reported about!](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061\/)  * The [color correction intensity slider](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tg0dR7Da) that I [previously reported about](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-color-correction-slider-3458931\/) is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2!

My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [\/u\/FragmentedChicken](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FragmentedChicken\/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https:\/\/www.androidfaithful.com\/samsung-galaxy-s25\/)*## DesignThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. The Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.The Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color.

All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.A new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).All three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.## CamerasThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f\/1.8 aperture, and 1\/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f\/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f\/2.2 aperture.The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f\/1.7 aperture, and 1\/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f\/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f\/2.2 aperture.While there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.* Reportedly improved shutter speed\/lag.* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.## The S25 series under the hoodThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.Their press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. The heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.Storage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. Connectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. All three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.## Battery & chargingThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. All three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI featuresThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. The new Galaxy AI features include:* Now Brief      * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  * Now Bar      * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  * AI search in Samsung Gallery      * Enables searching through photos with voice input.    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  * Personalized Data Engine      * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.      * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.      * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  * Audio eraser      * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.    * Runs on-device.    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.* AI settings search      * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change.     * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text\/accessibility options appear.  The improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:* AI Select      * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.      * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.* Sketch to Image      * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  * Object eraser      * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  * Generative edit      * In-and-out painting is more accurate.      * Now runs on-device.  * Portrait Studio      * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.      * New analog style filters are available.  Outside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:* Gemini integration      * You can now long press the side key\/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).      * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions.     * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files\/images\/YouTube videos, and more.      * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  * Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  * Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  Samsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.

If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data.  * **Offline Device Lock** automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time.  * **Remote Lock** lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil.

Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1741":{"post_title":"Fast charging is fucking amazing!!","self_text":"I just got the Pixel 7 Pro and this is the first \"new\" phone I've ever had. All my other phones have always been 3-5 year old hand me downs, I was finally in a position to be able to afford a nice one and damn I love it so much. Whenever I see the words \"charging rapidly\" I get a huge burst of dopamine, and don't even get me started on the speed of the phone.

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3.

Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**.

Between bloatware, factory camera defects and especially locked bootloader I was just looking for an excuse to buy a new phone. While searching around for a phone I stumbled on an article about Sony Xperia 1 VI and fell in love with it. I looked around, found a Sony Xperia 1 V for 400 euros refurbished and took the chanceScreen: This is by far the best upgrade for me. The 4K 21:9 120HZ screen is so nice to use I regret not getting the phone earlier. Compared to most phones nowadays that want to get as big as and as wide they can, this phone is a pleasure to have in your palm. If you watch a lot of movies, read books and manga like I do this form factor is incredible. It would be unfair not to mention things like native 4K and true HDR support, while also giving you a choice between 1080p 60Hz\/120Hz and 4k 60Hz\/120HzPerformance: What can I say about it. 12 GB of RAM + the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 makes a perfect pair. Daily use and multitasking is a fabulous and you wont perceive any lag at all. Even in more demanding situations like crypto trading (which I usually do on my phone) and some gaming (mainly TFT) no lag is noticeable while the phone stays resonably cool. When gaming at 4K 120Hz I did notice the heat levels rising but thats reasonableBattery: All in all battery life is good, but could be better. One full charge will get me through the day with my usual settings (1080p 120hz, about 40% brightness, Bluetooth, Mobile Data on and about 6-7 hours of screen time). The only downside is the charging speed (from 20% to 100% is a bit more than an hour usually) but if you keep battery percentage between 40% and 80% to retain battery health the charging time is about 30 minutesCamera: Sony's professional camera software is widely known to betop notch and this phones comes packed with it. Having never been into photography I didnt know what to expect and thought I would get overwhelmed with options. Most people say that the camera is best when used with pro settings but I dont know what to use and when. So far Ive been using it in basic and auto mode and the photos come out looking great. The huge sensor on the back makes for crispy clear and nice detailed photos, while having great contrast when taking videos. Even in very low light and deeply alternating low\/high light environments the photos and videos (such as a recent rave I went to) come out perfect with no adjustmentsFeatures: What more can I say other than this being a modern saviour. The 3.5mm audio jack and SD Card slot make this phone a clear winner for me. I like to use a local audio library with HQ audio files so having non-expandable storage is a no go for me. Also why would anyone dislike having expandable storage? Other than providing more storage space it has the obvious advantages of transfering files between your devices easily and never losing your data if your phone dies (as long as you remember to store it there lol). I wont say anything specific about the 3.5mm jack's driving capabilities as Sony itself hasnt still listed which DAC theyre using but so far most people say its OKSoftware: This change was also night and day for me. Going from the heavily customized, clunky and full of bloatware Samsung's OneUI to this is night and day. This UI is a soft reskin of stock android with some extra nicities added. Silky smooth and never experienced any animation lag or any bugs at all. This phone also has no bloatware since you can uninstall anything you want (even Sony's preloaded apps) without root, unlike OneUI which comes full of uninstallable bloat. Another major thing I was really in love of was this phone having an unlockable bootloader. I never understood any manufacturer's choice of locking the bootloader and never will. Having an unlockable bootloader should be a consumer's right. Whatever I wish to do with my device is my business and my business only. However that should also come with accepting the consequences of your actions. If you decide to flash a dubious ROM\/kernel\/recovery and your phone bricks it's your fault and your fault only. No manufacturer's responsible for you not doing proper research or not following the due procedures correctly and killing your phoneTL;DR: Amazing screen and great performance as expected of a year old flagship. Perfect aspect ratio for content consumption, 3.5mm jack and SD card make this phone a perfect pick if you can get it at a nice price"},"1746":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1747":{"post_title":"Gemini is getting smarter with apps, YouTube videos, and your camera","self_text":"Samsung is one of the best-selling Android smartphone brands, so it's no surprise that Google works closely with them. During the launch of the Galaxy S25 series today, Google unveiled several upgrades to Gemini, some of which are exclusive to Samsung devices and Pixel phones. These include enhancements to Gemini Live and the introduction of Project Astra capabilities in the Gemini app.## Gemini Live will let you chat conversationally about images, files, and videos[Gemini Live](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fY5jwF7TQmE) offers a more natural, free-flowing conversational experience with Google's chatbot, allowing users to even interrupt mid-sentence to ask clarifying questions or change the subject. This feature was initially announced at Google I\/O 2024.Starting today, Gemini Live will let you add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation. This allows for conversational interaction with files and videos.These capabilities will initially be available on the Galaxy S24 and S25 series, as well as the Pixel 9 series. They'll roll out for other Android devices in the coming weeks, though an exact release date hasn't been shared.Gemini Live is currently accessible on Android and iOS through the Gemini mobile app. It's broadly available to adult users in a wide range of languages.## Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini app[Project Astra](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nXVvvRhiGjI), one of the most anticipated announcements from last year's Google I\/O, connects Gemini to the real world. You can ask Gemini questions about your surroundings, with the assistant drawing on information from Google Search, Maps, and Lens to provide answers. It can remember previous conversations and even retain visual information about things it has seen in the last 10 minutes, all while supporting conversations in multiple languages.Google announced today that Project Astra capabilities are coming to the Gemini mobile app in the coming months. These capabilities include live video streaming and screen sharing. The Galaxy S25 series and select Pixel devices will have access to these features first. A broader rollout timeframe has not yet been announced.## Gemini will support chaining actions across apps and servicesAlthough Gemini uses extensions to connect with many external services, it can currently only use one per request. For example, if you ask Gemini to text your friend Michael directions to the nearest coffee shop, it would have to perform these actions separately: first, use the Google Maps extension to find the coffee shop; then, use the Messages extension to compose the text.Starting today, Gemini can perform multiple chained actions across services. At Unpacked, Samsung demonstrated how this will allow users to, for example, ask Gemini to text a friend the location of a nearby pet-friendly Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. Meanwhile, Google highlighted how you can ask Gemini to save a list of high-protein lunch recipes in Samsung Notes or Google Keep.Google says this feature will be available on all devices that support Gemini, including the web and iOS.## New Gemini extensions for Samsung appsGoogle also unveiled new extensions for Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, Samsung Notes, and Samsung Reminder.

Here's my opinion, which you're fine to ignore or enjoy.For a full price handset of \u00a31100, you should expect a handset that can compete with the best of today's phones. And the Honor Magic 6 Pro is up there with the best. Here's the obvious reasons why:- Latest premium chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) with 12GB of RAM (+8GB Turbo Boost when needed), meaning fast and fluid performance including strong multi-tasking performance and fast responsive. I love Androids for their multi-tasking ability vs iPhones- Premium, vibrant and large (6.8 inches) FHD+ (2800x1280) display, with accurate colours and enjoyable and comfortable viewing experience. Refresh rate up to 120Hz for buttery smooth scrolling that supposedly dials down to 1Hz when screen is idling to preserve battery, but I've yet to measure this. Can confirm the phone drops down to 60Hz when in ultra power saving mode- Premium camera set up, including triple rear camera set up and selfie camera with 3D depth camera that takes rich, clear photos with lots of detail, especially in strong light conditions. Videos can be captured at up to 4K 60FPS on the rear camera and capture excellent quality videos with great colour and detail, especially on Movie Mode- That front facing camera set up is the only one in the Android market that offers secure 3D Face Unlock like that of Face ID on iPhone which works in the dark and is also meets biometric security requirements for banking apps, Google Wallet etc.- Excellent phone reception and sound quality\/microphone pick up. No issues with signals or struggling to hear or be heard in phone calls. It has Voice over Wi-Fi (e.g. Wi-Fi calling) for those in a network that allow it, meaning if your base mobile phone reception is poor and struggle to get a signal, the network uses your Wi-Fi instead and the phone pics up that to maintain connectivity). It also has Voice Over LTE which uses 3\/4\/5G to boost your base voice call quality too- In-screen fingerprint reader which I barely use because of the fast and secure Face Unlock- Premium build and strong, curved front glass panel protection which make the phone feel premium. I unfortunately dropped this phone from about waist height face down onto a road surface and feared a shattered screen. Instead, all I got was a tiny chip in the corner of the panel that I forget is there as it's so small and of sight- Loud, clear, and balanced speaker set up which if you're the person who likes to listen to music without earphones won't get annoyed at the down firing speaker being covered by your hand, muffling your sound- Fast wired charging (80W, but no charger supplied), however with my current 40W charger it takes just under an hour to fully charge- Speaking of battery, easily two full days on a full charge, which I think is improving as the phone learns my useage behaviour- While Samsung S24 series have \"circle to search\", the Honor series have this too. You draw a circle on the image you want to search with your knuckle and drag it to the edge of the screen where it can then be searched in Google. Works all the time and is pretty accurate in identifying the image- Familiar software experience if coming from a Huawei phone (I upgraded from Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- Has a Desktop mode (like Samsung DeX but this was also on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), which is capable of turning the phone into a mobile PC and works brilliantly (I forgot my laptop once and this saved the day for me as I was able to engage this mode and plug into my desk monitor, keyboard and mouse with a USB C hub- Genuinely useful one handed mode (same as that on Huawei Mate 20 Pro)- If you have existing Huawei or Honor technology e.g. laptops or earbuds, this works perfectly well with these (like an iPhone with a MacBook etc).- Setup from Huawei Mate 20 Pro was easy- all apps and most settings including home screen folders and camera\/picture folders were copied across in the same way with the apps and media in the right folders so it was like picking up from where I left off- 4 years of Android OS updates (shipped with Android 14) and 5 years of monthly Android security updates (which have so far been regularly monthly and on the latest patch at time of writing)However, here's the bits that could be better:- It's massive, and it usually requires two hands to hold it with, even with one handed mode. Weight is top heavy because of that camera bump- Camera bump is ugly and heavy, however with the right case equipped (I went first with the Official Honor Bracket Case first but have since opted for and stuck with a cler silicone case), the camera bump offers a decent ridge for your finger to rest on while holding the phone. The bump cause the phone to lean up when on a table so doesn't lie flat. Some might like that, but I don't. On the plus side, because it's big and central(ish) there's no wobble- A couple of software bugs which I'm sure will get ironed out, including not being able to auto fill verification codes from SMS into Google Chrome, the QR code can't read FIDO barcodes. But I've never had any apps crash, close randomly, or just fail to open- Aggressive power management of apps requires manual input on what apps you don't want it to shut down or launch automatically (same as Huawei experience, so new users might get a bit bogged down by this and wonder why emails and messages aren't coming through on time). On changing these settings, I rarely miss any notifications - Camera can sometimes overprocess colours and sharpness, but varies with individual's preferences. Don't bother with expecting much detail beyond 10x zoom, but 5x zoom in good lighting is exceptional. Video sometimes struggles with autofocusing on a moving subject but found Movie mode is much better at switching focus so tend to record with that.- Magic Portal is mostly not very magical but has potential. Overall, I like the dragging of an image to the edge of the phone to share but you can't do it for any image on any app or screen your on, e.g. most 3rd party pages like BBC News through Chrome or Sky Sports, unless you highlight a bit of text first.- Magic Capsule again is not very magical. Some people might find it obtrusive (I came from a Huawei Mate 20 Pro with a wide notch so it's an improvement from that in my opinion and a trade off for having that secure Face Unlock). Magic Capsule is alright for seeing and knowing what you're listening to e.g. on Audible or Deezer\/Spotify, but my ears tell me that just as well. However, it's cool for if you've set a timer and can see how much time is remaining on the countdown, but bizarrely doesn't do the same when running the stop clock function, so you can't see how much time has elapsed- Battery gets warm when charging. Battery life was poor to begin with but since some updates and learning my behaviour, this is now excellent, but could be something you might be disappointed with at the start. It gets better- A phone this size and price should have a QHD+ display, like the Samsung S24 Ultra and Mate 20 Pro.- Privacy features on Android 14 are overkill. I think it limits functionality overall- Lack of charger and case in the box for this price feels a rip off, especially when the phone has 80W charging but you need a power brick capable of that to reach those speeds-Lastly, I miss the notification LED that let me know I had a message without turning the screen on.Overall, before landing on this handset I tried the iPhone 15 Pro (great hardware and handfeel, awful software experience), Samsung S24+, and the Xiaomi 14 (both of which were at best a side step from the ahead-of-its-time 2018 Huawei Mate 20 Pro that I was upgrading from, with the secure Face Unlock being an essential miss on both phones and more or less equivalent camera performance to the Mate 20 Pro). Coming from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this feels like the most natural successor albeit not without its quirks and individual taste preferences.If you're in the market for a premium Android handset, this is one of the best you can get."},"1750":{"post_title":"Starlink satellite messaging support is rolling out to the Pixel 9","self_text":"Looks like T-Mobile and Starlink are starting to let some Pixel 9 users into the satellite messaging beta.Just heard from two Pixel 9 Pro XL users that they were invited to the beta.

Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC.

These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1752":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share! I've created a [Github discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1) where people can post their results.Thanks for reading!"},"1753":{"post_title":"My experience with the Samsung phone and laptop ecosystem","self_text":"I was curious how well the integrations between phone and laptop would work, so I decided to test all of the relevant ecosystem apps and features. I\u2019ve included a description of each app\/feature for context, as well as my findings after using them. #Summary* Syncing Samsung Notes with Samsung Cloud worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption. Syncing with Microsoft OneNote only worked initially, and the notes are read-only.* Syncing photos and videos from the Samsung Gallery with Microsoft OneDrive from the phone worked, but viewing them on the laptop didn\u2019t.* Multi control (using the laptop mouse and keyboard on the phone) worked well, along with dragging and dropping files between devices.* Using Quick Share to share files between devices worked well, but the laptop can only share to Samsung phones.* Syncing calls with the Samsung Phone app worked well, but there\u2019s no end-to-end encryption for call history and contacts.* Continue apps on other devices (copying and pasting text and files between devices) worked well.* Samsung Flow (sharing text and files, notification and clipboard sync, and phone mirroring) worked well. Since the features overlap with Multi control, Quick Share, and Continue apps on other devices, I would stick with Samsung Flow.* Samsung Pass (password manager) worked well, but it only supports Chromium-based browsers.Disclosure: These apps and features were tested on a Flip6 and Galaxy Book5 Pro on loan from Samsung.#Samsung Notes[Samsung Notes](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9KfNlfq.png) is a note-taking app that supports text, images, drawing, and voice recordings. It can sync notes via Samsung Cloud which requires a Samsung account. It can also sync notes via Microsoft OneNote which requires a Microsoft account, and also makes notes accessible through Outlook. The sync options on the phone and laptop function independently, meaning they need to be enabled on both devices to sync notes.Syncing notes via Samsung Cloud worked as expected, and all notes are synced without an option to exclude specific notes or folders. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced notes. The app [requests](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/VVj5PMS.png) to always run in the background to improve syncing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with syncing on the Windows default setting (Power optimized), but it will keep prompting on each launch until granted the permission.Syncing via OneNote was a lot less seamless, as I wasn\u2019t able to get notes to sync reliably. It\u2019s worth noting that notes need to be synced to Samsung Cloud before they can be synced to OneNote. Additionally, note folders need to be manually selected for syncing (none are selected by default). The notes are synced to the OneNote feed instead of a notebook, and they can\u2019t be edited (read-only). In the [web version of OneNote](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I6sv8nE.png), notes are accessible through the Feed button on the ribbon panel. I wasn\u2019t able to access the OneNote feed on the [desktop version](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4vNFaoF.png), which appears to have been replaced by Sticky Notes. In the [web and desktop version of Outlook](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wDlJGzE.png), notes are accessible through the OneNote feed button on the toolbar. Syncing via OneNote requires granting [permission](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jOx0UVo.png) to view and modify OneNote notebooks.#Samsung Gallery[Samsung Gallery](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gqt7Zir.png) allows you to view and edit photos and videos stored on the laptop. It can sync photos and videos via Microsoft OneDrive, which requires a Samsung and Microsoft account, and for them to be [linked](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/vEROVh1.jpeg). According to Microsoft, OneDrive files are [encrypted](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/office\/how-onedrive-safeguards-your-data-in-the-cloud-23c6ea94-3608-48d7-8bf0-80e142edd1e1): >Each file is encrypted at rest with a unique AES256 key. These unique keys are encrypted with a set of master keys that are stored in Azure Key Vault. Syncing photos and videos from the phone to OneDrive worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that syncing to OneDrive can only be setup on the phone, and the camera folder is synced by default with the option to include other folders. I wasn\u2019t able to get photos and videos from the laptop to sync to OneDrive automatically, nor was I able to [view](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/G5VRptz.png) the photos and videos already synced to OneDrive. The only thing I was able to do from the laptop was manually upload photos and videos.#Multi control[Multi control](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6OvEF23.png) allows you to use your mouse and keyboard from the laptop on the phone. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. It\u2019s worth noting that it requires the Windows Location services permission to run. Once connected, the position of the phone relative to the laptop can be changed, and files can be dragged and dropped between devices.Multi control worked as expected. The laptop keyboard can only be used when the mouse cursor is on the phone. If you lose track of the mouse cursor on the phone, you can shake it to recenter it on the laptop. The only issue I had was with the [handle](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/o8RYVvE.png) that controls the area of the laptop display that the mouse can move to reach the phone, as I couldn\u2019t get it to appear reliably.#Quick Share[Quick Share](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/I0QqzFP.png) allows you to share files between the phone and laptop. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi or Bluetooth. A Samsung account is required to be visible to contacts.Quick Share worked as expected. It\u2019s worth noting that the desktop version of Samsung's Quick Share doesn\u2019t support sharing to non-Samsung Android devices. The only way to share files with other Android devices is to use [Google\u2019s desktop Quick Share app](https:\/\/www.android.com\/intl\/en_ca\/better-together\/quick-share-app\/).#Samsung PhoneThe [Samsung Phone app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GhRLsMS.png) allows you to place and receive voice calls from the phone on the laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the app to work.Placing and receiving phone calls on the laptop worked as expected, and there\u2019s an option to pull the call from the phone to the laptop and laptop to the phone. For incoming calls, both the phone and laptop ring, and a [notification](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/v5QsXH3.png) with the option to accept or decline the call is displayed on the laptop. If the call is accepted from the phone, there is a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) with the option to pull the call to the laptop. If the call is accepted from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg). For outgoing calls from the phone, a [pop-up window](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GVwJv5K.png) appears with the option to pull the call to the laptop once the call connects. For outgoing calls from the laptop, the call can be pulled to the phone from the [notification panel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sdGl9nB.jpeg) once the call connects.By default, call history is synced via Samsung Cloud, but contacts aren\u2019t. It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung Cloud doesn\u2019t support end-to-end encryption for synced call history, nor contacts.#Continue apps on other devices[Continue apps on other devices](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/070kba0.png) allows you to sync the clipboard between the phone and laptop. It requires a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi and Bluetooth. Both the phone and laptop need to be on the same WiFi network for the feature to work. Continue apps on other devices worked as expected, and you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop. #Samsung FlowThe [Samsung Flow app](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, sync notifications and the clipboard, and mirror the phone screen. It does not require a Samsung account, and connects via WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB.All of the aforementioned features worked as expected. The [main screen](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/bD2oVqL.png) of Samsung Flow allows you to share text and files between the phone and laptop, and the history is maintained even after disconnecting. [Incoming notifications](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jZbJddb.png) are displayed on the laptop with the ability to reply to messages directly from the notification. Notifications can also be viewed in the [notification section](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ygT92Mz.png) of the app, along with a [history](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EqWcTYu.png) for messages. It\u2019s worth noting that dismissing notifications from Samsung Flow on the laptop will dismiss them from the phone, while dismissing notifications from the phone will not dismiss them from Samsung Flow on the laptop.With the clipboard syncing enabled, you can copy and paste text and files between the phone and laptop.With Smart View enabled, you can [mirror](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XSQ8cMt.png) the phone screen. There are also [options](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xfoEIL8.png) to rotate the screen, maximize the window on the laptop, take a screenshot, enable Do Not Disturb, toggle the phone screen on\/off, adjust the mirroring quality, and change the sound output.#Samsung Pass[Samsung Pass](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9Nk5LML.png) is a password manager app. It requires a Samsung account, and needs to be setup on the phone first before it can be used on the laptop. Credentials can be synced via Samsung Cloud.Samsung Pass worked as expected. Chrome and Edge are the only two browsers that officially support the Samsung Pass extension, but I tested it with Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi and it still works.

But she had a list of valid complaints, below are what just can't be solved.I've had pixel since pixel 3. So if you can prove me wrong, please do, but it must be buried Somewhere. #1 Main problem. Do not disturb silences EVERYTHING. where as on apple, apps still had sound when you wanted it and explicitly press play for example. Me: yeah, I want a setting to turn all sound off great. Real life \/ wife: I want to not disturb but I want Audible & Everand audio books to work while I'm laying in bed falling asleep. Solution: seems the only solution is for each and every app to support the separate do not disturb override. YouTube music has this feature. There are about 9 different options to override DND, one is playing audio. But seriously, what were Google thinking? EVERY app needs updating to support this? And large brands like Audible clearly can't be bothered. ## Problem 1 solution Thank you all for the help Press and hold. Do not disturb from the shortcuts menu. When you drag down from the top, click on audio media alarms option and then toggle the allow media. #2 Calendar app swipes left and right, on apple it's up and down. Me: yeah live with it. Real life\/wife: your not the one that arranged our whole life. I love in calendar and need to count weeks all the time. Problem explained more. I see what she means. When swiping up and down to move between months. Friday is Friday is Friday bso you can count say 10-13 weeks by swiping through the months. When swiping left and right, all of sudden you've got duplicate values a bit from last month or a bit into next month and your eyes track it and you loose count. Sounds like a small problem... 3 months in she's still complaining. Solution: find a vertical scrolling calendar. I did find one. ACalendar, but even I think that's a rubbish app, i just opened it to check the name, gosh that's confusing, grids in grids, not clean\/nice and easy like the Google one. And the apple one looks even better. #3 Nfc \/ payment sometimes doesn't work. I can't write any more about this. She swears it's not as good. I've been with her twice and she's showing me it not working and then it does on another try.

Then for whatever reason her audiobook decides to play through the phone speaker. (Admittedly this was before we have solved the do not disturb issue so this may not be true in subsequent evenings. We will find out)I have the pixel 6 right now and never had this issue.

The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"1758":{"post_title":"Finally got a Desktop Mode working!!","self_text":"Thanks to the new version of scrcpy and Android 15!

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions.

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1763":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!   "},"1764":{"post_title":"What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software?","self_text":"I've had a question burning in my mind for a while now, and I figured I'd ask it on the biggest smartphone subreddit I could find (aside from the iPhone subreddits, iPhones don't count for fairly obvious reasons). Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant or inflammatory question, I actually do want to know what reasons people usually attribute to the stagnation of smartphone development, but if a mod still feels that this post is against community rules, I will gladly remove it.My question: What's responsible for driving the decline in the quality of both smartphone hardware and software? This is my main question, but I do elaborate on it further down in the post.The context: Recently I switched phones from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a Sony Xperia 1V, and I was both appalled and disappointed at the current state of smartphones. Now, I haven't been very active in the smartphone space, and I've only recently been mildly interested because of the need for a new phone. I used my S8 for a long time (June of 2017) and through that time I was immensely happy with my phone. It had all the features I could ask for, both hardware and software. Software-wise it had all the unlock features I could want, I could customize nearly anything I wanted about the phone, from changing default apps (even apps for opening niche file extensions), changing unlock rules, changing UI\/UX elements, etc all natively without having to hack together an app based workaround. And hardware-wise, it had a 3.5mm jack, type C port, single sim, and microSD slot, it had a 12MP camera, supported 32-bit\/384kHz audio, and an IP68 rating.With my current phone, which's both around 6 years newer, and 500USD (300USD adjusted for inflation) more expensive at launch, it has the same hardware ports, (type C (although it is a newer USB spec) 3.5mm port with worse audio quality(24-bit\/192kHz) either dual sim or single sim with a microSD slot(still only supports microSDXC, not microSDUC, and I'm not sure but doubt that supports microSD express), the usual sim slot) is still only IP68 rated and has mediocre internal storage and ram capacity compared to what's easily possible nowadays. Software-wise customizing UI\/UX elements is a pain, it doesn't have a lot of unlock options compared to my old phone, I can't customize default apps for niche filetypes nearly as easily, and generally is more of a pain to find app-based workarounds for if the option I want isn't available by default.My argument: The decline in \"flagship\" phones should be clear even if you only look at the specs I listed above, but if not I go into each individual point below. For phone comparisons, I'll be using the Samsung S8 as the \"old\" phone, the Sony Xperia 1 V as the recent best of the best (since it has most of the best features, as well as the standard ports) and the Samsung S24 as the \"normal\" modern flagship, sometimes referring to the S24 ultra, because, apparently, there's now a flagship phone that leads all the other flagships?* Water\/dust resistance hasn't changed a bit (even in the newest Samsung phone that has fewer ports, with the main excuse given is for space concerns and water resistance. The water resistance hasn't changed, I would expect if you're trying to seal off any possible places for water to get in, that you're at least \\*trying\\* to increase the water resistance to the IP69 rating (nice). But no, that hasn't happened in any flagship phone, with or without these ports)* Storage space has increased a bit, but nowhere near what I would expect. With how memory density has increased, I would expect 512GB to be the standard for internal storage (with 1TB internal standard in the phones that have \"extra space\" from removing the SD card slot and 3.5mm jack, where you could put 2x 512 chips if for some reason you want to argue that a single 1TB chip isn't feasible). But for some reason 256 seems to be the standard, with a 1TB internal option ONLY available in the S24 ultra, a phone completely devoid of an aux port or expandable storage despite being the flagship-flagship phone (flagship^(2)?). Not to mention that no option above 1TB is available ANYWHERE that I can find, with the only way to achieve that being external storage, which is getting harder and harder to find on phones for some reason.* The phones that do still have microSD often don't support microSD express, or microSD-UC, despite these standards both being well established, backwards compatible, and offering a number of benefits over the older versions. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, with the only possible explanation I can find being cost savings since it is easier to design for the older standards and the older, simpler slots with a lower pin count are marginally cheaper, which for a \"flagship\" phone really isn't a good excuse.* Sound quality somehow hasn't settled at 32-bit\/384kHz, despite this tech being nothing new, taking up the same space as 24-bit\/192kHz, and not being anywhere near as cost-prohibitive as it once was. 32-bit\/384kHz should be the standard, yet somehow it's still possible to buy a \"flagship\" phone with DAC that doesn't meet these specs.* Ports and expandability are going backwards, with the only given explanations being uninformed at best, and blatant lies at worst, with the unexplainable thirst for thinner and thinner phones somehow outweighing adding a dual sim + microSD in a verticle config so as not to take up space in the X or Y directions. Not to mention the 3.5mm jack essentially going extinct.* Unlock options are somehow shrinking, with face unlock being removed in Android 10 for \"security concerns\" (which are valid, except that these \"security concerns\" can be completely worked around by letting the user set unlock rules for when and in what order unlock methods can be used, which is something that was (to my knowledge) only experimented with in one android beta\/experimental build (can't remember the exact term) for example unlock mode X can only be performed if the phone was either previously unlocked within Y minutes or if the phone is at any number of specified locations, and if not, the phone must be unlocked with method Q, W or Z). iris scanning isn't considered standard, despite camera tech being more than good enough for this to be viable, the number of fingerprints that you can register to unlock your phone is often limited despite having adequate storage space. Both PINs and passwords are thankfully widely available, but settings for PIN\/password entry sadly arent (for example the ability to choose whether the device unlocks automatically once the correct PIN\/password is entered, the orientation\/layout of the 10-key keyboard for PIN entry, etc). General unlock settings arent even available either, for example, how often\/with what parameters you need to use a PIN\/password instead of biometrics, if you need to use 2 unlock methods to unlock your phone, what features you can use without unlocking your phone (if you can respond to messages or not, if you can take pictures, edit pictures you just took, make phone calls, etc).* General UI\/UX options have more or less stagnated, typically requiring janky app-based workarounds. For example while Android by default allows you to install custom\/3rd party launchers, it doesn't have anywhere near the same support for installing custom\/3rd party shades (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel), navigation bars, \"recent apps\" screens, or other integral UI\/UX elements that people may want to change. For example, on Sony phones Sony doesn't allow you to swap the back and recent apps button (despite this being a years-long complaint from thousands upon thousands of users) so the solution is to install an app (the app I use is called \"navbar\") that displays on top of the navigation bar and essentially replaces it. However, this only works 95% of the time, with the default navigation bar often still being visible before you unlock the phone, or when the show\/hide settings of the default and 3rd party navbar are different, and on hides\/shows before the other. Or for another example, if you want to replace the default shade (the swipe-down notification\/utility panel) (the app I use is called \"oneshade\") meaning that you, once again, have to install a 3rd party app as a workaround. Again, this only works around 95% of the time, with you often still being able to accidentally use the default shade (this can be \\*mostly\\* fixed using ADB commands but is still not optimal). So far I haven't seen ANY way to customize the layout, function, or look of the recent apps screen, which I personally feel is a travesty.* The general industry sentiment for sideloading apps has somehow shifted to the stance that it is insecure, undesirable, or in some cases a dangerous activity. and while it \\*can\\* be dangerous if you install from random websites that are half written in Russian with X-rated ads on the side of the page, generally sideloading is safe, and even one of androids biggest strengths, but in recent years I've noticed more people talking negatively about sideloading, as well as a lot more warnings on my phones whenever I try to do so, and generally it seems like phone manufacturers are trying to dissuade people from sideloading, as opposed to trying to make it more streamlined and safe, by adding a field in the apps menu to sort\/filter by app source (pre-installed system app, pre-installed non-system app, Google Play store app, sideloaded app, 3rd party app-store app, etc)More elaboration on my point\/question: As seen above, it is quite clear that the whole concept of a \"flagship\" smartphone has turned into nothing more than a marketing term, with \"flagship\" phones not actually making many changes from one to the next, they aren't making brave moves with adding features, only by taking them away, and they aren't pushing what's possible with tech, or even implementing cutting edge tech anymore, with nearly most of the major components on a cellphone mainboard being off-the-shelf parts that were widely available before the phone was ever even being designed, which isn't necessarily bad, but it speaks to phone manufacturers not making large leaps in tech anymore, and just going with whatever is easiest. The whole point of something being a \"flagship\" is that it is the newest, most advanced, and most complete in every way, which completely differs from how most phones are feature-incomplete, lacking in ports, and being inferior\/average with respect to hardware specs. And software isn't much better, where the software is stagnating, and often the \"solution\" to this is just re-skinning the OS, changing up the order of menus, changing a couple of small things here and there, and calling it a major re-working of the OS, which is completely inadequate if you want to call this innovation or make any argument that you're trying your best as a multi-hundred-billion dollar company.I've heard several theories as to why this is happening, ranging from the theory \"capitalism bad, this stagnation is inevitable with a capitalist system that puts the shareholders first\" to the theory of \"this isn't actually bad, this is just what people want, and very few care about these things\" and I'm genuinely curious what the broader community thinks about this. Do people really just not care anymore? Is the process of enshitification really just an unavoidable side-effect of our current monetary system, where companies focus more on making money than making the world better?What other ideas do you all have for the potential causes of this, and most importantly, what do you all think we can do to fix this if anything? I'm especially interested to hear from industry professionals, like engineers, software developers, project managers who oversee development, and anyone else who could have insight as to why companies do these sorts of things, but I still want to hear from anyone else who has ideas!Again, as I said at the beginning, if this violates community rules\/policy, please let me know and I'll be happy to either fix the post or remove it entirely."},"1765":{"post_title":"2 things stopping me from switching to Android\n","self_text":"I am freaking tired of iPhone 11 pro max, the buggiest software I have ever used and the most annoying and difficult OS to use, also the phone doesn\u2019t catch proper signals, everyone keeps telling they are unable to call me many times.

In android OS provides a consistent close button but iOS still doesn\u2019t have it and all these things stop from buying new iPhone 16 pro.Anyways so fed up by iPhone that I want to switch to android back again after using iPhone for 3 years.2 things stopping me from doing it are: Photos app search feature: I can find any picture if I know any partial word written in it and I have tried google photos app in iPhone and it can\u2019t find the same photo Apple photos does which I want. I have backed up this image in both apps and if I search \"list\" or \"listen\" apple photos brings it up but google photos doesn't. weirdly gphotos can bring it up with word \"unlock\" so app is buggy or something. google only shows it when I search whole word \"listener\", I have many documents photos and cant switch without partial text search in photos. pixel 9 pro has screenshots app but I want it to search all kinds of photos not just screenshots. does any of your apps able to search this image by any partial word in it?https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yae8nz9h9k6e1.jpg?width=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93bad3f6ceb1497d9ac92ff7d6a66f174fa4e3d6Second is faceID: iPhone unlocks in total freaking darkness without blasting my face with light and also instantly and also works 100% of times without compromising security. I don\u2019t want to use fingerprint because my sisters used to unlock my android when I was sleep and I used to think nobody knows my password and I\u2019m safe when in reality I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to use any method that\u2019s insecure. Pin and password can also be seen or recorded, now that there are cameras everywhere and phone stores all my money and I don\u2019t want to put it any risk so unlock method of phone and banking apps is very important.

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1767":{"post_title":"Switched to iOS for a month after 8 years on Android, then switched back.","self_text":"I started with the iPhone 5c which I got for Christmas in middle school. It was fine, and a fun little device, which was actually great since I've always preferred smaller phones. But, after a few experiments gone wrong, I messed up both the headphone jack and the battery, so I got the Galaxy S7 two years later when it came out. It was a great upgrade at the time, with a vibrant OLED screen, fingerprint scanner, great (for the time) camera, and waterproofing, although its size was still bigger than I would have liked. I used it for another year or two, then hopped around on a couple other phones I bought used online, then stopped at the Galaxy S10e which I've been using since I got it in 2020. It's been one fantastic device with basically everything I want: small-ish size, headphone jack (which could no longer be taken for granted at the time, unfortunately), OLED screen, waterproof, and USB-C.But, at more than 5 years old now, its battery is showing its age. Even with light browsing I find myself needing to reach for a charger, and any travel requires a battery bank. So, I looked around with dismay at Androids nowadays and see that almost nothing else is small and has a headphone jack, which is a key feature that I want since wired earbuds is the hill I will absolutely die on. I would have loved to try the Zenfone 10, which is basically the new Galaxy S10e in both size and functionality, but I'm also on a non-GSM carrier through my family that doesn't support it. So, if I can't get a headphone jack on Android, I might as well go back to Apple since it's what everyone is raving about, blue bubbles and all, and it's probably improved a lot in 8 years.I picked up a used iPhone 13 mini since I love the small size of it and used it for a month. Setup was smooth with Apple's fantastic Android switching process. Face unlock is pretty great too, coming from the S10e's fingerprint scanner which is sometimes hit-or-miss for me. But, that's where the fun ended. I immediately noticed that I took a downgrade in almost everything, listed below:\\- The vibration was so much weaker. The Taptic Engine doesn't pack nearly as much punch as the S10e, which is average in terms of vibration in my estimation. This was for the notifications that vibrated at all in the first place.\\- Microsoft Teams and Outlook, which I use for work, simply refused to vibrate for notifications. I tried looking in every setting under the sun and coudn't find out why they wouldn't vibrate. Sounds were enabled, notifications were enabled, phone was not on silent, everything. Extremely infuriating.\\- You can't disable the phone shutter sound, for the camera OR screenshots, when not on silent. I want to hear a ringtone for calls, but that's it. Having to pick one or another was also quite annoying.\\- Holding the power button doesn't turn the phone off anymore. Minor, but kind of annoying to me as well.\\- For some apps, including WhatsApp and eBay, I couldn't set silent notification sounds. I prefer to have silent notifications for everything except phone calls. The only option is to disable notification sounds, but I found it also disables vibrations.\\- Apple Autocorrect has quite an annoying feature where it sometimes autocorrects groups of words. My style is to ensure individual words are typed correctly, and once I press the spacebar, the word is done. Apple thinks otherwise and \"fixes\" words I typed correctly.\\- The touchscreen is much less sensitive. With the S10e, I find that I can still use it with thin gloves. No such thing with the iPhone that instead needs to feel my bare skin.\\- No camera quick launch. Samsung phones have had camera quick launch for years by double pressing the power button, even from lock. Great for getting the camera ready immediately to capture fast incidents. No such thing on Apple, where the process to open the camera on the lock screen is slightly slower.\\- iOS gallery doesn't separate screenshots and photos into separate folders, which happens with the Samsung. Extremely annoying to me, since I like to organize my photos accordingly. Screenshots kind of get lost among photos.\\- I knew what I was getting into going in, but not having a headphone jack was extremely disappointing. It felt much less convenient needing to bust out the dongle to plug my earbuds in, almost discouraging.\\- iOS hides your notifications once you unlock the screen. On Android, they stay both on the lock screen and on the swipe-down menu. Plus, there are tiny icons at the top that show you which apps have unaddressed notifications. iOS has the red bubble alerts, but you can't see them all from one place, unless you do two gestures instead of one to see past notifications in the Notification Center.\\- iTunes syncing for local MP3s, which is how I listen to my music, is still more complex then it needs to be, whereas Android is still good ol' drag-and-drop.\\- You can't bring Shazams over from Android to Apple. I would have lost a bunch of history or have to log in on the web version to see my Android Shazams.\\- I found my thumbs tingling more using the iPhone instead of Samsung. I think it might have been from the left-swipe-to-go-back gesture, which is a bigger gesture than pressing the always-present back button at the bottom of Androids.\\- iOS kept the keyboard lower on the screen than Android, which made typing a little more difficult.With the direction that Apple is going, with no more Mini devices (which was one of the things to entice me back over) and further removing functionality by axing the SIM slot in favor of eSIMs, and the above problems, I decided that iOS still isn't for me. Now I'll probably have to babysit my battery more or settle for something bigger. Currently I have my eyes on the Galaxy XCover 6 Pro. But happy to be back :)"},"1768":{"post_title":"Lock screen interactions on Android are clunky","self_text":"As an iOS user who's looking to replace an aging iPhone 11 soon, I am seriously considering the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 9 Pro. However, one thing that gives me pause is the inefficiency of lock screen interactions on Android.On iPhones, you pick up the phone and see your highest priority notifications, then press any of them and you are directly taken to the app, as Face ID has already authenticated you. On Android, you have to first press the notification then move your finger to another part of the screen to authenticate. This can involve hand gymnastics on phones like the S24 Ultra.Furthermore, on iOS you can swipe right from the lock screen for additional widgets and swipe down to access Siri-suggested apps and a universal search box. On Android, you have to first authenticate with your fingerprint and then you're forcibly taken to the home screen and *then* pull down to access universal search (if you have enabled a GoodLock setting - god knows if Pixels can even do this).My decision would be so much easier if it were possible to not make Android take you to the home screen after authenticating."},"1769":{"post_title":"Is Huawei worth it after this new GMS method came out?","self_text":"I'm a huge Chrome,YouTube, Play Store & Social Media user but I'm impressed by Huawei phones especially the Pura 70, i wasn't planning to buy from Huawei despite loving it because of the lack of GMS.

This was done for hardware reasons: The Galaxy has a tendency to run hot and get hot when charging, even when the charging stand has active cooling or is in the path of an AC vent. This would cause the battery to swell. Then the power button started not responding...This was my third Samsung model. My first was the s10 and I went through at least three of those in two years due to hardware failures. Second was an s20+ and was actually a decent phone, but I needed an even bigger screen for my old eyes, and had that one for about 18 months. I've had the 22u for about two years.With both anecdotal (self and friends\/family) data about issues with Samsung products (camcorders, fridges, TVs, etc) not replicated with other brands and the news reported issues (Samsung phone batteries, self-destructing washing machines, etc) I decided \"No Samsung\" and narrowed down to the Pixel 8 Pro and OnePlus 12. The OnePlus won out for value and reputed quality, especially regarding the CPU (Snapdragon vs Tensor) and reported battery life.A week in, so far other than the proprietary charging protocol (does use USBC-PD and QI as well) I am liking the hardware. The UI... I was using Nova anyway so whatever.But I'm finding I miss some of the Samsung apps.Some are publicly available and work, like Samsung Health and Gear Wearable (I still have an s4 watch and Buds). Took me a half dozen times to get the watch to pair, though.... OnePlus's \"Smart Panel\" is both better and worse than Samsung's Edge Panels. Supported apps from Smart Panel open as a floating window, making it a lot easier to, say, look something up in a password vault and enter into an app, but Sammy's does apps, widgets, tools, an extended clipboard... And Photos. Sammy's Photos app works *exactly* the way I want, and not just because I'm used to it. When using the Album view (my default) it put system items first, ie Camera and Screenshots, then every other folder with images alphabetically. It will periodically scan through and then offer to smart resize tiny images, which almost always works great and can be cancelled per image. And making screen-sized wallpapers is a snap by zooming and framing, then using a single button on screen to crop to visible. The photos app on OnePlus, not so much. It's a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing. Google Photos suck, Google Gallery is slightly better as a viewer as at least my album folders are there alphabetically but the contents aren't, and editing is less than basic. Currently also looking at F-Stop and Piktures.The customizations from Good Lock.

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"1788":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all. Has my brain just been warped by Apple over the years?"},"1789":{"post_title":"Starlink satellite messaging support is rolling out to the Pixel 9","self_text":"Looks like T-Mobile and Starlink are starting to let some Pixel 9 users into the satellite messaging beta.Just heard from two Pixel 9 Pro XL users that they were invited to the beta.

The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1791":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to!

Users will also be able to easily manage their hearing aids through a native Android settings dialog that includes a way to change presets. For those who don't know, LE Audio is the latest Bluetooth audio standard that brings enhanced performance, new features like Auracast, and support for hearing aids. Audio is transmitted over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, which is beneficial for hearing aids due to their need for all-day battery life.While most Android devices already support hearing aids via Google's ASHA profile, ASHA is a proprietary protocol, requiring hearing aid manufacturers to implement support for multiple platforms. LE Audio standardizes hearing aid support, making it easier for hearing aid manufacturers to create products that support multiple platforms.Google says that this new integration is also coming to the Pixel 9 series, and it'll be available starting tomorrow with the Android 16 beta. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series will also be getting this integration with an upcoming Android 15\/One UI 7 release in the coming weeks. ## Support for braille displays that use HIDFor people who rely on braille displays, Android 15 will add support for those that connect via Bluetooth and use the Human Interface Device (HID) standard. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series will be the first to receive this feature with TalkBack 15. This support will expand to other devices running Android 15 in the coming months. Samsung uses its own version of the TalkBack accessibility service, separate from Google's, which is the reason for the staggered rollout.In addition, TalkBack 15 on Samsung devices will now use Google's Gemini models for AI-powered image descriptions.

At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1795":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

In android OS provides a consistent close button but iOS still doesn\u2019t have it and all these things stop from buying new iPhone 16 pro.Anyways so fed up by iPhone that I want to switch to android back again after using iPhone for 3 years.2 things stopping me from doing it are: Photos app search feature: I can find any picture if I know any partial word written in it and I have tried google photos app in iPhone and it can\u2019t find the same photo Apple photos does which I want. I have backed up this image in both apps and if I search \"list\" or \"listen\" apple photos brings it up but google photos doesn't. weirdly gphotos can bring it up with word \"unlock\" so app is buggy or something. google only shows it when I search whole word \"listener\", I have many documents photos and cant switch without partial text search in photos. pixel 9 pro has screenshots app but I want it to search all kinds of photos not just screenshots. does any of your apps able to search this image by any partial word in it?https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yae8nz9h9k6e1.jpg?width=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93bad3f6ceb1497d9ac92ff7d6a66f174fa4e3d6Second is faceID: iPhone unlocks in total freaking darkness without blasting my face with light and also instantly and also works 100% of times without compromising security. I don\u2019t want to use fingerprint because my sisters used to unlock my android when I was sleep and I used to think nobody knows my password and I\u2019m safe when in reality I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to use any method that\u2019s insecure. Pin and password can also be seen or recorded, now that there are cameras everywhere and phone stores all my money and I don\u2019t want to put it any risk so unlock method of phone and banking apps is very important. I use faceID to unlock passwords or banking apps or phone (due to hidden notification settings) every 2-5 minutes or so.Do you have any recommendations?"},"1797":{"post_title":"Xiaomi 13T Pro Review (South Europe) ","self_text":"Backstory: I was an iPhone guy for a well until I enlisted in the army and decided to get a cheap phone with me because in training especially I was afraid I would break the expensive iPhone. Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1798":{"post_title":"PSA: Verizon Business Users - RCS Setup Issues on Pixel 9 Pro Fold (SOLVED!)","self_text":"Heads up, If you're on a Verizon business account and tearing your hair out trying to get RCS to work, I've got the solution.I was stuck in \"RCS setup\" limbo for weeks, tried every trick in the book, and was about to give up.

Thought I\u2019d share my experience, after almost 8 months of ownership.P8P Bay 256GB has been my daily driver since its release. I use it with 5G on, screen at full resolution, dynamic \"smooth display\" refresh rate is on, no bluetooth or tethering. Brightness left on auto.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design & display, OS (with some caveats) | Negatives = everything elseThe positives :Camera : beautiful imagery has always been the signature of the Pixel line, and this release is no exception. Every shot has this mesmerizing \"Pixel touch\", and the new ultrawide sensor is finally on par with the main unit. Videos are world class too, not quite on the level of the iPhone but we'll get there eventually.Beautiful and unique design : It's sitting in a clear case, and in a sea of generic, boring slabs, it really stands out and doesn't go unnoticed. People often ask me what kind of phone it is, most are still not aware that Google is making smartphones and has been doing so for almost a decade now.Very long software support : Seven years of updates is unrivaled in the Android scene, albeit with the following you\u2019ll understand no one would willingly keep this phone seven years, so it\u2019s not really a positive.World class display : stellar QHD 120hz panel, sharp and bright.Sleek OS : Android in its purest, cleanest form. Customization galore. However as I'll mention later this pure android is NOT running smoothly, so I don't know if this count as a positive. Now onto the negatives.First off, we must address the elephant in the room. Battery life. This phone charges PAINFULLY slow and discharges EXTREMELY fast. The opposite of what you want, right ?The 10 minutes top ups to 50% is a concept Google seemingly never heard of.You want half a charge ? Better sit & wait half an hour. Full charge ? Go watch a movie.  Now the discharge, and this is where the real drama clocks in. This phone EATS battery, ON IDLE.On your average 9 to 5 workday (no camera, no games, just basic apps) you\u2019ll head home with 15% tops. Phone dead by 7pm, then full charge will eat 90 minutes off your schedule, better not be in a hurry.Now try to make a bit of power usage out of your power user phone : A bit of pictures for work at 10am, a short 4K video at 1pm, a bit of Fallout Shelter on the toilet at 2pm. You\u2019re now looking at a 4pm shutdown.But let\u2019s go real on the camera, after all this is a camera flagship and it should be your reliable companion on a field day. Starting at 10 am : pictures, videos, a bit of editing, about 40 pictures taken and 3 videos of 10 minutes each. Shutdown at 1PM.The CPU just eats battery on IDLE doing NOTHING. Throw anything heavy at it and you\u2019ll head home with a dead phone, one that died long before your day was over. Simple as that.Keep in mind that this is my experience with a 8-months-old device, and it will get worse and worse as the battery cell degrades over time. One can only wonder how many cell replacements this phone will need to get to the end of its famed software support.Now we need to talk UI and animations because this isn\u2019t good either. Stellar 120hz OLED panel and stock android should be a recipe for smoothness, but not here. Actually, some animations including the cool lock screen clock are barely 60hz. Switching apps isn\u2019t 120hz either, nor is scrolling. A TON of lags and various frame drops, resulting in a framerate like 40-90hz, never stable, with the occasional but very rare peak at 120. This isn't TW3 gameplay on a potato but simply browing menus and scrolling instagram on a 2023, 1159\u20ac flagship phone from Google.This phone FEELS slow, and yet consume an enormous amount of power to do so. Infuriating.One day I had to handle a coworker\u2019s A54 to tweak a few things. I was SHOCKED by the smoothness, this was indeed true 120hz, which only happens a few times a day on Pixel 8 Pro. I realized what I was missing on by handling an Exynos mid-ranger. I understand the need for a dynamic framerate, not locked at 120hz all the time to save battery. But only reaching 120hz 5 times a day and still having a mediocre battery life wasn\u2019t what I had in mind.Finally, the optical, under-display fingerprint scanner. This, my friends, is an antique piece of hardware that belongs to a museum. Remember the Huawei Mate RS from 2018 ? One of the first phones with UDFS. The optical technology was so experimental and unreliable (still is, most OEMs moved on to ultrasonic) that Huawei also included another optical fingerprint sensor on the back of the device, just in case. Well, this ancient tech is what you have on the Pixel 8 Pro, and no optical sensor backup in sight.Sometimes, it can take up to 2 full seconds of contact to\u2026.successfully fail to unlock. After it fails 3 times or so, it will ask you to enter your password, making one-hand unlocks a luck job. Sometimes it will successfully unlock after a couple tries, but a couple tries of 2 seconds each makes unlocking your phone a 4 seconds job which is just painfully slow. The occasional one tap magic is as rare as the occasional 120hz peak in the UI. As for face-unlock, I know it's there but I disabled it because it doesn't work in the dark (no IR sensor) and I simply want to unlock my phone at waist height, without having to raise it to my face.Pixel 8 Pro remembers me of an exotic sports car that might look incredibly cool from a distance but is actually a pain to live with on a daily basis. And indeed it does look incredibly cool. I remember seeing this phone as a much better pick than the generic Galaxy and the boring iPhone, but I\u2019d rather go boring or generic than having to handle this mess of an hardware Google sold me for 1159\u20ac.TLDR : Positives = Camera quality, great design | Negatives = everything else"},"1801":{"post_title":"Fast charging is fucking amazing!!","self_text":"I just got the Pixel 7 Pro and this is the first \"new\" phone I've ever had.

I know a lot of folks here don't like Twitter\/X links (because of the login requirement and...other reasons), so here's a bullet point list of everything from that thread:  * Since Android 15 has now reached **Platform Stability** with Beta 3, the \"Android version\" [no longer says](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYn_eNWwAILMr3?format=jpg&name=large) \"VanillaIceCream\" but rather \"15.\" The \"preview SDK\" flag is no longer true, and the SDK version is set to 35 now.* Android 15 Beta 3 introduces a new **\"Home Controls\" screen saver** that lets you control your Google Home devices when your device is idle and charging. [You can find screenshots of this feature in the article I wrote back in April.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-home-controls-screensaver-3433352\/)  * The **screenshot overlay UI** has been [slightly tweaked](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYN1XnXsAE3kER?format=jpg&name=large) in Android 15 Beta 3. The screenshot preview now sits above the buttons instead of inline with them.  * The **Adaptive Vibration** feature has been removed in Android 15 Beta 3. It was [added in Android 15 Beta 2](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-vibration-3443842\/), perhaps accidentally. This feature uses your phone\u2019s microphone and other sensors to determine the sound levels and context. It then automatically adjusts your phone\u2019s vibrations based on your environment. * **Color contrast settings** can now be [accessed](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYP2IQWIAA3Uwe?format=jpg&name=large) from Settings > Display in Android 15 Beta 3, in addition to the already accessible entrypoint from Wallpaper & Style.  * Android 15 Beta 3 now lets you [trigger Circle to Search with Android's action key](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/circle-to-search-android-15-action-key-3452492\/), meaning you can finally **use Circle to Search with both taskbar styles** (transient and persistent) on the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.  * Code in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests the OS will be able to **automatically delete your face or fingerprint unlock** [if they aren't working well.](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-redo-biometrics-3452354\/) Android will then prompt you to set them up again.  * A new config in Android 15 Beta 3 suggests that Android will finally [stop treating slow 7.5W chargers as fast](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-fast-charging-threshold-3452415\/). Android 15 is preparing to tweak the threshold that determines whether a charger is seen as fast, from a measly 7.5W to a more reasonable **20W**. This threshold determines whether the \"charging rapidly\" text is shown on the lock screen.  * Google is working on a new app called **Creative Assistant** that could use [generative AI to create custom stickers](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501\/), among other things. I found a stub for this app (and some references to it) in Android 15 Beta 3.  * Android 15 Beta 3 has added the **\"show long app names\"** toggle that I [previously found back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/pixel-launcher-show-long-app-names-3437829\/). This toggle lets you decide whether to truncate app names in the app list and search results.  * Under Settings > System > Navigation mode, there's now a **toggle for Circle to Search**. [This toggle](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYZuc0X0AAbjh5?format=jpg&name=large) used to be found one page deeper in gesture\/3-button navigation.  * The **wallpaper picker UI** has been tweaked in Android 15 Beta 3. Here's [Beta 2.2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqoXMAAQhSW?format=jpg&name=large) versus [Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYboqqWkAArWzH?format=jpg&name=large). In Beta 3, it's more obvious that you can zoom in or pan on the image. * The **Adaptive Timeout** feature that I [discovered back in April](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534\/) is [here in Android 15 Beta 3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQYeswMWgAEw161?format=jpg&name=large), at least on my Pixel 8 Pro! Adaptive Timeout \"automatically turns off your screen if you're not using your device.\" Adaptive Timeout seems to check your proximity sensor to see if anything is in front of it (like the inside of your pocket). If so, it shortens the screen timeout and turns the screen off early. This'll be useful for people who like to have longer screen timeouts but who forget to turn the screen off manually.  * Google is preparing to make the **Settings app in Android 15 more organized**. In Beta 3, new code reveals how the [top-level settings page will organize entries](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) into visually distinct sections.  * In Android 15 Beta 3, the new volume panel is [no longer collapsible](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GQcir6mXEAAIZTw?format=jpg&name=large) when you aren't playing any media. It's still collapsible when you are, though.A few settings have been renamed:  * Device & app notifications \u2192 Notification read, reply & control* Turn screen on \u2192 Screen turn-on control* The description for \"allow camera software extensions\" has been updated to say \"...such as HDR, Night or other camera extensions\" when previously it ended with \"...such as Eyes Free videography.\"  ---   That's all for now. I have more stuff I'll post about after which I will update this thread accordingly.(By the way, I also post on Threads, Telegram, and Mastodon if you want to see my Android coverage elsewhere.)"},"1803":{"post_title":"As an iPhone user in the US, here are the reasons I haven't been able to stick with any Android phone I've tried (it's not the ecosystem or iMessage)","self_text":"I've been primarily an iPhone user in the US for over a decade now, but that's not really how I'd even like it to be. There are many things that I appreciate about Android phones and the OS, and many things I dislike about iPhones and iOS. I don't care about Apple's ecosystem, I don't use really any of Apple's first-party apps, and with RCS available I don't care about iMessage.I've tried to main a decent number of Android phones over the years, though (Galaxy S9+, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, OnePlus 12, Galaxy S24 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro XL), and this is the list of dealbreakers across all of those phones that consistently causes me to sell them and revert to an iPhone:1. **Scrolling**. Honestly, this alone is probably enough to be a dealbreaker on the phones I've tried. Despite a few slight differences between the phones (with the OnePlus 12 being the best of what I've tried), the scrolling smoothness, speed, and inertia on Android phones drives me insane. Scrolling is a major thing that you do on a smartphone, and the \"on-ice\" scrolling on iPhones causes you to scroll less often with slower-speed scrolling that makes text easier to read when in motion. Android phones almost always have scrolling speed inconsistencies when a flick will cause the page to scroll down less or more than you expect it to, and the scrolling will abruptly stop in a way that feels jarring. On top of that, widespread app optimization issues means that scrolling in many, many third-party apps is a stuttery mess (Reddit, X - Pixels are the worst with this).2. **Apps**. This is likely more of an issue in the US than in other places, and it's also probably more or less of an issue depending on the apps that are important to you. However, I've felt like a second-class citizen in the US as it relates to the third-party app experience on Android. There are many popular, well-designed apps that are only available on iOS (Flighty, Copilot Money, Overcast, Apollo when it still existed) or apps that prioritize iOS and release updates there first (Instagram, Snapchat, United Airlines with boarding pass integration in Apple Wallet) in addition to optimization being far better on iOS devices as I mentioned earlier. I know that there are also a ton of third-party apps on Android that are not available on iOS and that may allow you to achieve customization or features that iPhones cannot do, but this is still primarily an issue for the many popular apps that people use every day.3. **Speakers**. This isn't quite as important as the other two, but it's still extremely annoying to me. I listen to podcasts, music, and watch videos on YouTube constantly at home on my phone, and the speaker quality on basically every Android phone I've tried (with the exception of the Pixel 9 Pro XL which comes *somewhat close*), is terrible. They all lack the full, low-end sound of the pro iPhones that allows voices to be heard clearly while in the shower or music to sound like it's not being played from inside a garbage can.Reading sentiment from others online, I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy because so many Android users claim that these aren't issues at all.

"},"1805":{"post_title":"A note on the Google Tensor G5","self_text":"A few days ago, news broke out that the Tensor G5 chip had taped out on TSMC's 3nm node. The Tensor G5 is slated to be the chip powering the Pixel 10 phones, which will be unveiled next year (2025).[https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/](https:\/\/www.trendforce.com\/news\/2024\/07\/04\/news-tsmc-reportedly-secures-3nm-order-after-tapeout-for-googles-tensor-g5\/)This news has greatly excited Google Pixel fans, because it marks a seismic shift in the history of Tensor SoCs.Leaks of Google's foray in making a custom SoC to power the Pixel smartphone, first began to surface in 2020. The following year- October of 2021, Google unveiled the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro powered by the 'Tensor' SoC. Since then, Google has released several subsequent generations of Tensor SoCs;2021 - Tensor - Pixel 6.  2022 - Tensor G2 - Pixel 7.  2023 - Tensor G3 - Pixel 8.  2024 - Tensor G4 - Pixel 9\\**Tensor G4 and Pixel 9 will be unveiled next month*[https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/6\/25\/24185767\/google-pixel-hardware-ai-event-august-date)Unfortunately, it has been well established that the Tensor SoCs have issues. Users have complained that the phones get hot and the battery drains faster compared to other phones. These complaints have been corroborated by findings from professional reviewers, who have discovered that the Tensor SoCs are less efficient than their peers;[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)There are 3 factors that affect the user experience with the Tensor chips;1. **The manufacturing**All Tensor chips, from the original Tensor, through to the Tensor G4, are manufactured by Samsung Foundry. Samsung Foundry is one of the only 3 manufacturers of advanced semiconductors (the others being Intel and TSMC). Over the years, Samsung Foundry has earned a reputation of being inferior to TSMC.  Enthusiasts have noted that chips by Samsung are less efficient than those manufactured by TSMC. Once again, this has been confirmed by professional reviewers:[https:\/\/x.com\/Golden\\_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063](https:\/\/x.com\/Golden_Reviewer\/status\/1712878926505431063)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/s0ukXDnWlTY?si=PCAaCxZ11DAa-ImM)Geekerwan discovered that the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 has a double-digit percentage efficiency advantage over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. These two SoCs are identical, save for the fact that the former is manufactured on TSMC 4nm, and the latter on Samsung's 4nm. Thus, it's clear that Samsung's nodes are inferior to TSMC's.This is why the fact that Tensor G5 being manufactured at TSMC excites Pixel fans. It brings good tidings, that the Tensor G5 will have dramatically improved power efficiency over it's predecessors.2. **The design**If Manufacturing is one side of the coin, then Design is the other side. Both are equally important to defining how good an SoC is.Google says that Tensor G1-to-Tensor G4 are custom SoCs, but they are not fully-custom, per se. These SoCs are co-designed between Google Silicon team and Samsung LSI. (Note: Samsung Foundry and Samsung LSI are different divisions. Foundry is the manufacturing division, while LSI is the semiconductor design division).An in-depth analysis of the original Tensor chip by Anandtech, revealed that the SoC used a mix of Google IP and Samsung IP. IP blocks such as the TPU and Media Decoder were Google designed, but most of the other stuff such as the CPU implementation, GPU implementation, power rails, interconnects, memory controllers were based on Samsung's IP.[https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency](https:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/show\/17032\/tensor-soc-performance-efficiency)Leakers have revealed that, over the years, Google has been more involved in the design process. With each new generation of Tensor chips, Google has been replacing Samsung IP blocks with their own in-house Google IP. The Tensor G5 will mark the culmination of this journey, as it is designed fully in-house by the Google Silicon Team, with no involvement from Samsung LSI whatsoever.However, Pixel enthusiasts should be cautious, because the move to a fully-custom in-house SoC design doesn't necessarily entail dramatic improvements in performance\/power efficiency, unlike the move from Samsung to TSMC. SoC design is hard work, and there is a high probability that there will be deficiencies, especially in the first generation (looking at you- Snapdragon X Elite).The Tensor G5 SoC will be the first fully in-house design by the Google Silicon Team, in contrast to the decade+ experience that Samsung LSI has in designing SoCs. We do not know how good Google's IP is, compared to Samsung or Qualcomm's for instance, because Anandtech doesn't do in-depth analyses anymore (sad:\/).(3) **The modem**The modem is not part of the Tensor SoC, but it's a crucial component that defines the user experience of Tensor Pixel users.Up until the Pixel 5, Google used the integrated Qualcomm modems that came along with Snapdragon SoCs. That changed with the Pixel 6, as Google opted to put an external Samsung modem to the Pixel phones.Users of the Pixel 6 had numerous complaints; calls dropping, calls not going through, not receiving messages, overheating, high battery drain while using 5G etc... clearly the modem was at fault.Google continued to use Samsung modems in subsequent generations of Pixel phones, despite user complaints. Software updates, and newer modems have alleviated some issues, but the experience still remains subpar compared to phones with Qualcomm modems.This is probably because they have a contract with Samsung to use their modems, as long as the Tensor chips are co-designed with Samsung LSI and manufactured at Samsung Foundry. That all changes with the Tensor G5\/Pixel 10, becuase the SoC will be fully designed in-house by Google and manufactured at TSMC.So this then raises the question of what modem will the Pixel 10 come with? An in-house Google designed modem is certainly out of question, because modem design is even harder than SoC design. (Intel once made modems, but they were inferior to Qualcomm ones. Intel eventually sold their modem division to Apple, who has since then tried to develop their own in-house 5G modems. According to rumours, the project is not going well...).There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Huawei, Samsung and Mediatek.Google may opt to keep using the Samsung modems for the Pixel 10 series, or switch to a Qualcomm\/Mediatek modem.**Conclusion**The fact that Google is going with TSMC for their fully in-house Tensor G5 is certainly exciting news, but fans should temper their expectations. We still do not know what modem Google will choose to pair the Tensor G5 with. The SoC will be a special milestone for Google, as it will be their first fully in-house design, but the actual gains in performance\/efficiency may be evolutionary, not revolutionary."},"1806":{"post_title":"I made a tool to measure the battery impact of different Android web browsers - here's what I learned!","self_text":"Howdy, Reddit!A little while ago I wrote a simple power consumption benchmark for Android web browsers, called **browser-power-hour**. I've since used it to test Chrome against Firefox on two different devices, and I'm here to share the results!Why is this useful? It's pretty common to see battery drain brought up as a reason to use (or avoid) certain web browsers, often without evidence. But browsers are complex and constantly evolving pieces of software... maybe those perceptions are out of date? Maybe they're still valid! Unlike raw performance, there are few, if any, good ways to reliably measure battery impact for an individual app, especially on Android, so it's hard to tell what's actually true. Hence, this project! My goal is to be able to provide _objective metrics_ on browser power efficiency to demystify the battery impact question.I [wrote a blog post](https:\/\/mark.bestavros.net\/blog\/browser-power-hour\/) about the benchmark if you're interested in more detail about how it all works, but I suspect most are primarily curious about the results. Let's focus on that!**A few caveats to keep in mind**- Most importantly: **the actual consumption percentages mean very little on their own**. A web browser's _relative_ power consumption next to its competition is the only useful statistic this benchmark provides.- Adding onto the above: these results, and the benchmark as a whole, are NOT meant to be general-purpose device battery tests. Under the hood, the benchmark tests a static set of websites sequentially. Great for testing an individual app, not great for testing a device that will be subject to far more variable conditions.- The results for one device\/SoC may not be relevant for other devices with wildly different system configurations.- Finally: I am far from a technical Android expert. It's possible there are far better ways to do what I'm doing, and it's possible there are significant improvements to be made to my benchmark. If you believe there are, the benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I encourage you to contribute!**Let's get started!**I'm a Pixel guy, so I tested this on both my old 4a 5G (powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G) and my new Pixel 8 Pro (powered by Google's Tensor G3). As I mentioned up top, I chose to focus on Chrome and Firefox - lots of alternative Android web browsers are Chromium-based and (from additional tests I've run) appear to have similar speed and battery performance to stock Chrome, so there's no need to analyze more than just one Chromium-based browser for this initial comparison. Firefox, on the other hand, is Gecko-based, and might potentially perform meaningfully different!We do know one big thing going into this: Firefox has traditionally lagged behind Chrome on speed benchmarks, so a lower benchmark score isn't _surprising_. What I'm hoping to see is that, despite the lower performance, Firefox is still competitive with Chrome on power efficiency.**Pixel 4a 5G**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-5664094).)_| Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 4.00%             | 4.02                || Firefox | 4.22%             | 4.72                |This is a little shocking - Firefox is outright competitive with Chrome! Firefox is on average ~17% faster in Speedometer benchmarks while maintaining similar power consumption. That's great news if you're on a 4a 5G or another device that runs the Snapdragon 765G - you can base your choice on the browser's feature set instead of performance. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G is out of support, and it's possible that this trend won't hold with newer devices.Speaking of...**Pixel 8 Pro**_(Full results with screenshots [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour\/discussions\/1#discussioncomment-9742036).)_ | Browser | Power consumption | Speedometer average ||---------|-------------------|---------------------|| Chrome  | 0.38%             | 8.14                || Firefox | 1.38%             | 8.43                |This is also surprising! Firefox performs similarly to Chrome... **while consuming 3.6x the power** in active use. That's... pretty bad.It's unclear on the surface why there's such a large discrepancy here, but (baseless speculation alert) my best guess would be that Firefox just isn't well optimized for Tensor G3, or Chrome is VERY well optimized. Either way, the end result for Pixel 8\/Pro users is that Chromium-based browsers are the obviously better choice.**What about [insert device here]?**This is where I need _your_ help! That's right, YOU!I don't have a wide variety of phones to test on, just my two Pixels. Notably, that means I haven't tested a single flagship Qualcomm chip. But you might be able to! The benchmark is [open source](https:\/\/github.com\/mbestavros\/browser-power-hour), and I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run it yourself. If you do run the benchmark, please share!

I live in the USA and therefore here the Galaxy of the series \"S\" are all released with the Snapdragon of the series 8 of the year; that means that the Galaxy S25 here will come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 with its new Oryon cores  The Galaxy S25 strikes me to buy them as they will use those new Snapdragon with totally new architecture, but it is not the only change I expect. since the S22, the 3 sensors of the camera have not changed at all and all the improvements have come via processing and software, but there are already 3 generations with the same camera sensors and it would be ridiculous from my point of view that they did not update them for the new S25 and S25 Plus. If they don't, they're going to be too far away and outdated compared to the competition. For example, Google with the Pixel 9 updated all its camera sensors and now all the sensors in the Pixels are 50 Megapixels; for example, the main sensor of the camera went from being a Samsung GN2 sensor to the new Samsung GNK. I think if the S25 and S25 Plus do not update at least the main sensor of the camera, I will not buy it. "},"1808":{"post_title":"Comparing Galaxy S24+, Motorola Razr+, and Pixel 6A","self_text":"My data provider occasionally gives me exceptionally good deals on new phones via trade in bonuses to the point of being near free, so I decided to test out 2 new phones and review how they compare to my old Pixel 6A.  The two phones were a Samsung Galaxy S24+ and a Motorola Razr+ (2023).  The activity I use my phone for most often is playing podcasts via Bluetooth to my hearing aids while walking\/hiking with my dog.  We cover 200-300 miles each month, including some full day hikes.   The battery needs to last the full day.   I don't have any other particularly unique phone needs.   I use my phone for calls, texts, pictures, apps... each day; but nothing especially processor intensive.  A summary of my thoughts is below.**Physical Design:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A   Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: C+   I've never had a folding phone before.   The Razr+ far exceeded my expectations.  The folding wasn't just a gimmick. I found folding to be a very useful feature that was implemented in clever way, with being able to view an exterior screen when closed and use basic functionality including apps when folded closed.   I also like the the built in screen protector, the phone being especially thin,  and various other aspects of the physical design.  I also prefer the side fingerprint sensor, which was more reliable and accurate than the screen fingerprint sensor in the other phones. It's a well thought out and well implemented phone that takes some unique approaches, rather than being the same as so many other phones.     The Pixel and Galaxy didn't really impressive me.   Between the 2, I preferred the Pixel exterior design.  I prefer the rounded edge of the Pixel to sharp corners of the Galaxy.  The exterior material is also less heat conductive.  However, I prefer the larger screen size with the S24+.  Rather than screen size, the main reason I rated the Pixel low was lack of wireless battery charger.   That's a critical feature to me.   My Pixel regularly accumulated pocket lint in the USB port, which made charging awkward until getting lint out.  If I was unsuccessful in getting lint out, I was unable to charge and use my phone.  Among the screen fingerprint phones, I find the S24+ to be more reliable than the Pixel.   Some people report very high rates of failures with Pixel 6A fingerprint unlock to the point of being unusable.  It's never been that bad for me, perhaps because I save my fingerprints multiple times in all phones.     **Personalization \/ Pleasant GUI Experience:  Best = Motorola Razr+** Motorola Razr+: A-      Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Galaxy S24+: B-  I initially found my Pixel to be near unusable because it was so different from what I was used to.  However, switching to 3 button navigation, installing Nova Launcher, and spending some time customizing, I came to enjoy my Pixel more than any phone I had previously owned.  I used this same Nova Launcher design on my Razr+, which works just as well  I also prefer the always on graphics and wallpapers structure on the Razr+.   My only complaints with the Razr+, relate to interfacing with other apps.  For example, mapping apps get confused about the direction (probably because of folding), so the arrow points in the reverse direction.   Duo security didn't automatically transfer to Razr like it did to Galaxies  Podcast Republic was initially confused about the transfer.   Part of these issues likely relate to 3rd party apps doing less testing on a less popular model. I found S24+ to be more problematic.  My biggest issue is having no way to increase size of small buttons and small text.  For example, the \u201cclear\u201d notifications button is too small for me to click consistently, and there is no way to increase size.   I don't like the design of the small shortcut buttons without any text, or the small text on the always on screen (widgets and charging information size can not be increased), or the small text\/buttons in various other places.   I realize that there is a magnifier, but it is awkward to turn on\/off, and in my experience when enabled there is a lag in typing, to the point of being near unusable.  At least it's better than the S24 due the bigger screen size.       **Battery Life:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A+   Pixel 6A: C- \u2192 B+   Motorola Razr+: B-    Battery life on my S24+ has far exceeded my expectations.  Battery life is far better than any phone I have ever owned.  If my phone is at 100% when I go to bed, it might be at 98% when I wake up.  It could be even less, if I better optimized with turning off always on display.   When walking hiking, I can easily go the whole day without need to charge battery.     My Pixel initially used to hemorrhage battery life.  I might lose 30% of the battery while sleeping and unused.   After turning off some kind of adaptive network optimization, I had normal battery life that was consistent with other phones, but nothing like the S24+.  I've been disappointed with the Razr+ battery life.  It doesn't last as long as I'd like in day to day activities, worse than the Pixel did when new.           **Listening to Podcasts\/Music in Hearing Aids via Bluetooth:  Best = Pixel 6A** Pixel 6A: A   Galaxy S24+: A-      Motorola Razr+: D    My hearing aid officially requires HAC T4 or better.  Among the listed phones Pixel is the only phone that meets this requirement, so it's the only phone that is listed as compatible.  In spite of not being officially compatible, the S24+ seems to work well.   However, with it being T3 instead of T4+, I fear that my S24+ may not work as well, if I get a new hearing aid before getting a new phone.  The Razr+ fails and is unusable  with default configuration.   If I only wear one hearing aid and keep the phone in my back pocket or jacket pocket, the Razr+ is good enough to be usable, but it's not usable when wearing 2 hearing aids.           **Other Phone Activities Beyond Podcasts\/Music:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: A     Motorola Razr+: A-     Pixel 6A: B+   I spend far more time listening to podcasts on my phone while walking\/hiking than any other phone activity.   Other activities include phone calls, texts, occasionally taking pictures, checking apps (including checking and posting on Reddit), receiving notifications, searching on Google, mapping\/directions, link to Windows, flashlight, etc.  Nothing is especially processor intensive.   All of the phones seem fine for these types of basic activities.  I do occasionally notice that the S24+ is slightly faster, smoother, or has a useful feature that is not available to others.   And I occasionally notice the reverse for my Pixel, which is to be expected given it's an older phone than the others, with weaker performance specs.  The smaller screen size also makes typing more awkward on my Pixel.       **Customer Support:  Best = Pixel 6A** Google Pixel: C   Motorola Razr+: C-      Samsung Galaxy: F    I was disappointed with customer support among all 3 companies, but I was least disappointed with Google support.  Google support often had long waits, but at least they provided helpful responses.   Motorola support was initially useless, but they later connected me to a level 2 engineer who was only available by phone (why only offer support via phone for people whose phone may not be working?) that seemed to be knowledgeable.   My experience with Samsung Galaxy support was horrible.  Wait time wasn't long, but support was worse than useless.   I was often unable to understand what they were writing.  They appeared to have skipped words\/sentences or maybe they were mixing up who they were talking to.   They did not add any useful information beyond what I already knew and gave incorrect information about my problems.  I believe the first person I talked to intentionally lied to me about claiming that she'd send a software update to fix my issue \u201cin particularly shortly\u201d when she realized she didn't know what she was doing or have anyway to resolve my issue.  Maybe this relates to using support outside of normal business hours.       **Overall:  Best = Galaxy S24+** Galaxy S24+: B+   Pixel 6A: B   Motorola Razr+: C The Galaxy S24+ isn't my ideal phone.  It doesn't really blow me away about anything except the battery life.  However, it performs very well in the 2 activities that are most important to me -- listening to podcasts\/music in my hearing aid and having a long battery life, including long enough to support a full day of hiking without charging. In my opinion, the Motorola Razr+ has the best physical design and GUI user expeience, but it was inadequate in the 2 features above that are most important to me, including not being compatible with my hearing aid, so the phone isn't going to work for me.  It might be a great option for someone else. I have really enjoyed my Pixel 6A.  In my experience it has been a great phone that was by far the best sticker price value among the phones above.  If my Pixel was a 7A with a wireless charger and newer implementation, it might have been more competitive with the S24+, but being an older phone without a wireless charger, I favor the S24+.  I plan to keep the S24+ for now. I may switch to something else the next time my data provider has a similar type of trade in deal.

You can also get the tag to play a sound directly from this app. It has a find tag button which then takes you into the Google FMD app - Chipolo doesn't have a companion app or any ability to update FW.* Double pressing the button makes your phone ring\/play a sound so that you can locate that if you misplaced it - Chipolo doesn't have this ability.* Fits perfectly with Airtag accessories.* Advertised as being UWB, although currently there appears to be no sign of this actually working in my Pixel 8 Pro.Chipolo One Point* Is quite a bit louder than the Moto tag but no ability to adjust the volume.* Has a built in key ring hole so you are not required to buy any extra accessories if you attach it to your keys.* Cheaper than the Moto tag. In the UK \u00a330 vs \u00a334.99So far from my initial impressions I will be using the Moto tag, mostly because it just looks better and is a better colour. The white chipolo tag attracts a lot of dirt and just looks grubby and not very nice over time.I don't really think the rest of the stuff is particularly important, although it's nice to have UWB comparability and the ability to do FW updates. I do like being able to ring my phone by pressing the tag, although with my old tile pro I used to active this in my pocket a lot. There is an option to enable\/disable this in the companion app though. Hopefully the slightly lower volume won't be an issue. I will get my Son to hide it around the house and see if I can locate it via the sound.Overall I think this is a more complete product compared to the Chipolo one point. I don't know if Chipolo intend to add these features or if they even have the ability to do so without new hardware (UWB will require new hardware).Hopefully this might help anyone trying to decide.Some pictures.[https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38](https:\/\/ibb.co\/4NHpK38)[https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc](https:\/\/ibb.co\/z4PKqFc)"},"1810":{"post_title":"Here's everything that's new in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2","self_text":"# What's available right now  * The top-level Settings homepage redesign that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-settings-revamp-teardown-3452543\/) is [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sWk5RxGP)  * The keyboard quick switcher feature that [I previously spotted](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-keyboard-switcher-revamp-3475688\/) is also [now live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sd0qyPhE)  * Another feature that [I previously reported on](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-screen-recording-chips-3474411\/) is also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [new status bar chips for screen recording\/screen casting.](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0sp6myIx8)  * Also live in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2: The [partial\/compact heads-up notifications layout](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tMN0RLaH) that I [previously reported about!](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061\/)  * The [color correction intensity slider](https:\/\/www.threads.net\/@mishaal_rahman\/post\/C_0tg0dR7Da) that I [previously reported about](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/android-15-color-correction-slider-3458931\/) is now available in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2!

And the areas Android could improve","self_text":"I know this is not an iOS\/iPhone subreddit. However, the other day there was a [What features does Android have that iOS does not](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Android\/comments\/1c42zw2\/who_uses_android_features_that_ios_doesnt_have\/). At the end, it made me think: \"What does iOS even have then?\" As much as Google is trying to restrict Android with each update, it still has way more features than iOS. Of course, it is the UI and UX. I went searching for a bit and stumbled across this video: [Designing Fluid Interfaces](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2018\/803\/) I found this video so interesting, it amazed me with just how much they thought of everything. When it comes to the UI and gestures, they take into account the weight, speed, momentum, inertia, elasticity, response, dumping, bounciness. Some interesting points from the video, in my opinion, were: - Weight of gestures at 20:52. Depending on where you are and what you are interacting with, the weight of the element on the screen is different. - Rubber banding at 17:00. Google added this to Android, but Android's screen-stretch is, in my opinion, a lazier solution, and not as pleasant. - Scrolling an app as it starts at 9:58. I really like this, makes apps feel more alive and instantly responsive. - Redirectable interface at 7:25. Android has something like this, but still not this well implemented. - Launching of an app and changing your mind midway. At 9:34 - The emphasis on inertia The UX on Android still does not match iOS. It has improved a lot, but when you use an iPhone, it still feels like there is something different there. It just feels better, more airy. And the video shows exactly why it feels better. Compared to iOS, Android still feels very much like it's \"on the tracks\". For example, take recents. You can swipe an app up in order to dismiss it, but then mid swipe, you may change your mind and want to change the app instead of swiping it away. [You can't do that because the UI is locked  vertically](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/11e4ff). Android tells you, \"You want to change the app? Let go and try again\". It's the same when switching apps, [the moment you initiate the move, you cannot swipe the app away, it is constrained horizontally](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/0c6f0e). These types of \"I go only this way and that's it\" interaction is present in many areas of Android, it feels robotic rather than fluid, and it is something Google should definitely work on as what really sells iOS is its playfulness, you want to find a reason to use it. A great UX\/UI should be like a \"ripple effect\", when a user dips their finger in the \"water\" and touches or moves something, there should be a knock on, rippling effect on everything around the component they are moving. All that said, I don't think everything is better on iOS. I prefer Android's quicker scroll, for example. I think iOS' is too slow. But at the same time, I prefer [iOS' low surface friction](https:\/\/streamable.com\/59901). Slightest nudge slides the UI, it's like having something on ice and it moves on slightest touch. I think it creates a feeling of a more \"alive\" UI. Besides the movement, and the interaction with the UI, in my opinion what both, iOS and Android lack, is the precision. Android lacks precision in UI elements, like: Levers, switches, toggles and other UI elements and controls need an overhaul; they should be more fluid and more interactive. * **Seekbars** - Android should improve seek bars by making them like [Bubble Seekbar](https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/566\/1*korvjd8Geu97pvZX_Fkf3g.gif). When you tap on a lever, a time or a percentage indicator bubble should pop up to indicate to the user at what position they are at. [Pixel GCam already has a pop-up value selector](https:\/\/streamable.com\/dafsk) (When you tap and hold to zoom, the selector lever moves up so it's not covered by your finger). [Solid Explorer has something similar for audio seeking](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/4bda8d) they should integrate something like that everywhere in UI. * **Precision seekbar scrubbing** - It takes multiple tries to select the exact value you want. Example: Say you want 150 value on the seekbar, you have to tap multiple times, because it selects 151, 157, etc... but not 150, unless you get lucky the first time. Watch how annoying it is trying to [select \"150\" value on a seek bar](https:\/\/streamable.com\/82gupm). It should not be that hard. This is something iOS has. By dragging up the lever up, you can make more precise, granular adjustments. * **Precision cropping** - An example where precision is required is when you are cropping a picture. First of all, you don't get a cropper tool magnification, so you can't position it precisely. Then, I would really like pixel perfect precision when cropping. I would like to crop a picture [exactly at the edge](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/xdV6Lr2c\/android-precise-crop.jpg), not approximately. But let's say you got the crop selection just right, you lift up your finger and it shifts couple of pixels. That should not happen. I made a [comparison video](https:\/\/dubz.co\/c\/c89bd1) of croppers from various apps, if you are interested. * **Under your finger tip** - Say you double tap on text, a text selection menu pops up, then you tap and drag the text around. You can, but the problem is that you can't see where you are placing it because there is no preview or magnification and you can't see what's under your finger tip because you are covering it. [Demonstration](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/b65771). Another example, when drawing something the \"brush\" is right under your finger tip, you can't where you're really drawing. They should add a preview that shows up above your finger tip and shows exactly where you are drawing or moving something around. * **The Magnifier** -  The magnified text should be the same size regardless of how big or small the underlying text is. Example, open this page in Chrome as a desktop version, select this text. Next type something in the search field on the right, zoom out the page and start selecting text, the magnifier is tiny. Here's what I mean in pictures: [Normal selection](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/c6YL3fGb), and then [text selection from within the search field](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/8D4hRRby\/j18gXBQ.png?dl=1). You see how small the magnification is in the second example? Another [example](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/Wbk0JXSf\/magnifying-glass-20230602.png) with GSMArena. Makes no sense. In my opinion, [WPS Office's magnifier](https:\/\/i.postimg.cc\/nHqJgHCd\/Screenshot-20210618-013812-01.jpg?dl=1) implementation is much better than Android's own. I think it looks better, and the magnification is independent from the underlying page\/text size, unlike with the Android magnifier. * **Split screen** - Activation needs to be a gesture. [Make it so when you swipe up and hold an app near the top for a second or two, multitasking activates and you can pick the second app below](https:\/\/streamable.com\/c9ei2). I stopped using split screen after they removed easy access to it.* **Tapping edges to change images** - I really like this gesture. It is implemented in Google Maps of all apps. If you open images for a place and start tapping edges, you can quickly move forward and backward through the list by tapping left or right edges of the screen. It's very convenient and quick. Simple Gallery has that feature too, but there should be an API available for developers. * **Swipe down to close window** - A really good gesture that Google Calendar has. If you tap on an event and open it, you can quickly close it by swiping it down or up. Great little gesture that it works with scrollable views too. For example, to close out an activity Google Calendar has [this very nice gesture](https:\/\/dubz.link\/c\/867545). I think it's a great feature and I would like it to be available in more apps. I think could be an example of Google's app departments not really working together, as you would think a nice gesture like that would be quickly shared and adopted in all apps, like Keep for example, where you close down a note quickly by swiping down on it. * **Edge bounce back (rubber banding)** - Already mentioned above, but adding edge over-scroll animation has been great in Android 12, but I am not a big fan of the stretching animation and would prefer a simple over-scroll effects like iOS. You know what would be cool? If when over-scrolling it revealed a picture of the SoC of the phone underneath, so when you've over-scrolling it's like you're looking behind the curtain. This has turned into a bit of a feature wish list but I just wanted to highlight the areas that I feel can be improved in Android. I think a fluid, interactive UI is something very important that really helps someone enjoy their device. I would like your opinions on this. I also wonder, do Google developers watch videos like the one I shared above? What do they think of it?"},"1812":{"post_title":"Long-Time iPhone User After 72 hours With Android (Pixel 8 then Samsung S24 Ultra) - My Reflections So Far","self_text":"After a decade with iPhone, curiosity finally got the better of me and I made the switch to Android. My trusty iPhone 13 Mini is still there just in case, but I really do hope to sell it soon. I wanted to document my journey over the last 72 hours with Android in case it helps someone else sitting on the margin just looking to dive in. These 10 things are simply my opinions and reflections! I'm sure my feelings will continue to evolve, but here's where I'm at after 3 days. As I started typing, I did not expect this to be so long, but I had so many things floating through my head. Sorry for the long read and I'd love to hear others who have made similar changes. **1. Sloppy first impressions:** I started with a Pixel 8. Got it for $390, in like new condition during eBay's memorial day sale, and just couldn't pass up that deal. The look of the phone never really attracted me before, but after a few hours it really grew on me. However, I really started to get annoyed at the experience and polish. For example, I had a lot of screens where the text was cut off or folders where the text was cut off. There were system pop-ups where I was expected to approve something that disappeared within a second before I could even read it - was it approved or was it declined?! But what really was upsetting was that there's no way to sort notifications by time. The phone would beep and then I'd have to spend a  few seconds trying to figure out what the heck the notification was amidst the long list. Half the time, the time stamp doesn't even show and I'm left wondering if I missed something. This was exacerbated when I started not receiving notifications I would expect, because my iPhone (which was still on WiFi only mode) was getting notifications for new Gmail messages for example, and the Pixel just stayed quiet. That was unacceptable and I decided to return the phone. However, my significant other has a Samsung, and she mentioned never having these issues so I stuck it out and tried again. This time, I figured - go big or go home - and I got the Samsung S24 Ultra.**2. Much better second try:** I read a lot of bad experiences about the UI of Samsung coming into this, but frankly it's a lot more polished than the Pixel. It's like there's a nice coat of paint over all the underlying workings and as an iPhone user, I appreciate that. Everything looks great and while I've been toying with some of the themes in the Galaxy store, I have gone back to the normal One UI each time.**3. Smart Switch works great.** It took about an hour to transfer all my settings and applications over to the Samsung. The only thing that took a little bit of figuring out was how to get 25K+ iCloud backed up photos onto this phone. Fortunately, there's an official Apple method for transferring iCloud files to Google Photos, and I initiated that. It's still not done but assuming this goes to plan, the transfer process wasn't that bad at all. I pretty much plopped my iPhone sim card into the Android, spent an hour waiting, and then all my old applications, wallpapers, and even placement of icons was there. Then, I just spent about half an hour signing into everything that I needed to (1Password is hugely helpful!) and I'm off to the races. **4. Settings galore:** I am not used to this many settings! It seems I am approving or declining permissions all day long. I have multiple Gmail accounts setup, and I have to go in and adjust each account's notification setting when I just want all of my Gmail messages to have the same setting. I thought I would like this level of customization but it's been a little frustrating finding everything, or trying to figure out what I'm even approving. I find myself on YouTube looking for videos for how to change things such as the lock screen shortcuts. I am hoping that once I get through this initial difficulty, then I'll be cruising. And the biggest thing - Samsung lets me sort notifications in chronological order! That's huge (for me).   **5. Navigation bars on top. Why?:** I had a small iPhone Mini so one-handed navigation was never a real challenge but I still appreciated how all the menu bars (Facebook, Safari, etc.) were on the bottom of the phone. It made navigation really easy. With all the customization I mentioned in #3, I just assumed this would be an easy fix on Android and I'd be able to change this for any app. I was wrong! Other than Firefox, I have not figured out how to do this in Chrome or Facebook (as an example). I really do not understand why the iPhone version of Facebook would have this on the bottom but the Android version would have it on the top! For a phone as big as the S24U, that would've been a really nice option.  **6. PhoneLink is pretty good:** I had gotten rid of my Macbook a long time ago. I basically live on my Phone and also have an iPad for when I need a bigger screen and a Windows desktop for professional work. Integration b\/w devices was never a big deal to me but I put I setup Phone Link and it's been pretty good. I don't have any real complaints so far - I can transfer files and get all my notifications and respond directly from my computer.   **7. Dex is really cool but also buggy:** The dream of having only to carry around my phone and never having to open up a laptop, tablet or desktop would be amazing. This phone is definitely powerful enough for the applications I use for work - Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. But Dex has some weird quirks that make it a little unreliable. For example, every time I open up an image in Gallery on Dex, the screen goes black for a few seconds before coming back on. Close the picture? Same thing! The cursor scroll just isn't as smooth as on my Desktop machine where I can customize the DPI settings exactly on the Logitech app. These are small things but build up into a less than perfect experience. But when it works, it works great and it's so close to a dream realized.   **8. Face unlock is pretty bad, and the fingerprint reader can be hit or miss:** FaceID on iPhone was a pleasure to use, except when it's not - i.e., I'm lying in bed. But for most situations, it works pretty good. For those moments I do wish I had a fingerprint reader so it's really nice to have that on the Samsung. But with that said, the Face unlock is horrendously bad. It works about 3\/4 of the time in good light and then never in low light. I think the fingerprint reader is 80% successful on the first try for me but that's still lower than I think it should be. Perhaps I should re-register my finger. *(Also, what's up with the super bright fingerprint reader on the Pixel 8? I feel like I was staring at the sun every time went to activate it! That said, it does feel like the Pixel's face unlock is better than Samsung).* And on the topic of security, I think one of the biggest things I miss is Apple Pay. Some of my favorite go-to restaurants locally let me order online and pay directly using Apple Pay. Now I have to memorize my credit card number....  **9. This thing is super powerful.** I think people who choose Android chose it for two primary reasons: customization (which I mention in #2 and #3) and power to be productive. It has been very cool to be able to export files from one app directly into another app, edit it there, and save it as a file and then transfer it to my desktop. On iPhone, it was never a certainty which applications I'd be able to import files directly into but on Samsung it seems everything is available. There's always a workaround or solution or a method to doing something and that's been pretty cool. The Snapdragon processor is quick and the screen is beautiful. It's a great media consumption device and I hope it continues to be as snappy as it is now, because 7 years of updates is a very long time!   **10. But the size of this phone is kinda insane.** Especially coming from an iPhone mini, this thing is so big! It literally does even fit in my pockets when I am sitting and I've had it slide out a couple times onto the floor already because so much physically hangs out of my pants when seated. If Samsung made a smaller Ultra version of the phone in the same size as the S24, then that would be perfect (kinda like how Apple has the Pro and Pro Max). I think if there's a reason I end up going back to iPhone, it's because of the size of this thing. I want something as powerful as the Ultra but in a smaller package, and I haven't found another company that makes something like that. I don't have a case yet and maybe a more textured case will resolve this.I'll keep this experiment going as I want to make a real effort to switch. Looking forward to continued learning!

Thats when I got introduced to this brand with the Redmi Note 9 Pro which I bought lightly used 2.5 years ago for 140$. I was shocked to see that what I did on my 1400$ iPhone actually felt easier on Android even on a cheap phone with low specs. There some huge gaps in terms of camera and snappiness of course but the experience was still a 7.5\/10 which for the price difference blew my mind and in fact some features on Android were plain impossible on iOS (custom video players, access to useful open source apps etc.) My previous experience with Android was way back in the day were I bought a Samsung Note 8 but proved fragile and broke from me literally accidentally banging it on a desk where I vowed that the quality was not there and I wouldnt buy that phone again (expensive phone too). After the Note 9 Pro was long obsolete in software and tried pixel os custom rom on it I decided its time to get something new, that was the Xiaomi 13t Pro. I got it used for just 350$ on July 2024 so this is 3 month long term review.Pros:Specs are amazing for the price (12-512)Microphones and Speakers just a tad under the flagships from Samsung and Apple which is quite the accomplishment.Display is great, brightness is a couple of years behind but I dont really mind.Charging is plain ridiculously good.HyperOS is actually not that bad, got its quirks sure but very usable just like I remembered MIUI was.Feels light on the hand, unlike most flagships which I like other people dont.Cons:No feature updates for over 4 months. One security update 4 months later (March to August).Camera... Look the hardware is there but the software isnt. You can make photos look good on this phone but there isnt that seamless click the button and it always looks above average you get from flagships. Auto focus regularly fails. Many modes have limitations with framerate and hdr functionality between the lenses.Battery is just above average but the charging completely makes up for this honestly.Heat, it gets hot often especially when using GPS\/Mobile Data.Bluetooth is quite buggy, I thought it may have been the earbuds themselves but every other device I own works perfectly but this drops out constantly for some reason.Hyperos. It has some quirks such as very aggressive battery optimizations and auto start limits every new installed app which I believe only Xiaomi does no other Android manufacturer and that has soured my experience overtime. I also hate the fact they make it as hard as possible to track battery health and consumption.TLDR: For power users and people that buy flagships and flagship killers I am afraid the software and firmware side of Xiaomi is not there yet and thats a shame because the specs are insanity but I guess thats what you pay for the reduction in price. I recommend going with a safe Android experience such as the Pixel or Samsung (Oneplus also suffers from poor software and in my experience even worse than Xiaomi in fact because they leave critical bugs on their software and major omissions whereas Xiaomi is more of a collection of smaller problems)."},"1814":{"post_title":"Is Huawei worth it after this new GMS method came out?","self_text":"I'm a huge Chrome,YouTube, Play Store & Social Media user but I'm impressed by Huawei phones especially the Pura 70, i wasn't planning to buy from Huawei despite loving it because of the lack of GMS. However, i found out that an app called MicroG came out that lets you install and use google apps quite natively, so this made me rethink if i should buy from Huawei or not.The lack of Google Assistant isn't a big deal to me and i don't care about the lack of Google Pay because i can use my other Android device to make payments.So the question is: after this nice new method to use google apps on it, is the Pura 70 worth it over S24 or Pixel 9 if i love the Pura 70 design the most?Note: planning to buy a Tablet and Earbuds afterwards that must be from the same company."}}}
