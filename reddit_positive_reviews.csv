"Positive","iPhone X to Pixel 2 XL, how do I make the switch? Kinda stuck in Apples Ecosystem but want to switch!.Hey everyone!I’ve been an iOS user since the iPhone 3G came out. Only briefly owned an Android Smartphone, the LG G2 which I loved hardware wise back then but hated software wise. Thats why I switched back to iOS again. Currently I have an iPhone X that I am giving my gf as soon as her contract runs out in June. I’ve lurked on this subreddit, as well as the galaxy s8 and oneplus ones and it seems to me that none of the Smartphones are as “perfect” and running smooth as Google Pixel.Software is definitely more important to me than hardware so I assume the Pixel 2 is definitely the way to go. I have a few questions beeing a longterm iOS user on how to make the switch the easiest. 1.	What I really love about Apples backup approach is the iCloud and really enjoy the care free backups overnight. Does google offer something similar? When I read about it briefly, I couldnt figure out if Google only backups via Google Sync or if it also has a dedicated Google Drive Backup solution for everything. I also read that backing up Messages is only granted for messages up to 25mb? I already use Google Photos, Contacts, Chrome and basically all the G Apps available on iOS so that doesnt worry me. 2.	How easy is it to switch all the content on my iPhone to the Google Pixel 2 ? Are there any hiccups or common things known not to work?3.	Will the OLED display on the Pixel 2 XL really be way worse than my current iPhone X with no problems at all, or is it still a hit and miss thing? I’ve heard some people and some youtubers say that Google improved their quality control in december/january and that most newer Pixel 2 XL don’t have a bad screen anymore. 4.	What is a good Smartwatch for the Google Pixel, I am currently using an Apple Watch 2nd Generation and love the Health tracking... 5.	... which leads me to my next question: How good is Googles Health equivalent compared to Apple Health? 6.	I am using a Macbook and if I wanted to backup my iPhone on it, I just plug it into iTunes and let it do its thing. Is there a equivalent for that on macOs for the Pixel phone?7.	Last question: As I said the reason why I switched back to iOS is because the software and everything tied together works so smooth and I don’t have to worry about security updates or OS updates in general. Now the only reason why I wouldn’t get a Pixel 2 XL is just because of the screen, thats why I lurked at the One Plus subreddit but the hate and the problems they got over there is a whole nother story. Did someone sucessfully custom rom’d a non Pixel Android Smartphone to a smooth level like the Pixel 2 XL here or played with the idea?Thank you all very much for your time!"
"Positive","Launch Pixel 8 Pro is Still a Beast.Been seeing another uptick of poor experiences with the new Pixel hardware, so wanted to throw in my positive experience(s) to mix things up. This is **NOT** me minimizing those anecdotes or claiming anyone who has had issues is lying. I am merely doing this to verify the concept of ""silicon lottery.""Pre-Ordered the Pixel 8 Pro through my carrier; it was $600 OFF before trade-in and I effectively got it for about $150 after handing in my Pixel 7. In the first month or so, I dumbassedly started tinkering w it before paying it off and ended up bricking it trying to install a Beta build. Google warranty replaced it, no questions asked, in about a 3-day turnaround.Since late October I've been using the Unlocked, replacement 8 Pro from Google alongside the Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel Buds Pro, and I want for virtually nothing. Having compared it to the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 Pro, I find the way Pixel hardware marriages together to be just as fluid if not more so in certain areas than Apple (I've tried my hand at AirPods and an iPad; I largely prefer the way Pixel plays nicely with my Tab S9 Ultra. S Pen brings everything together). Samsung is probably the most logical alternative for Android users at the moment. I found the Galaxy a breeze to use, but missing Pixel exclusives.All in all, silicon lottery. My replacement was mandatory as the software bricking ""compromised"" the initial model, so this isn't even technically the launch Pixel, but it was a brand new model they sent and not refurbished, so I consider it part of the launch batch. Even while tinkering, I have had zero heating issues, lag, or general bugs I can think of. Kind of strange.Just putting here in case anyone is thinking of the Pixel ecosystem. It works, and it works *damn* well. I enjoy seeing Google answer the efficiency concerns with each passing iteration; I do still think they could do more as a trillion-dollar company to speed things up, but I'm also not a giant tech conglomerate. On mine and many others in my friend/family circle's end, Pixel comes highly recommended here!"
"Positive","Yes, Pixel 8 Pro is worth it.Short intro: this is my first reddit post, and I though it would be a good idea to share my recent experience changing from an iPhone 13 Pro to Pixel 8 Pro.I wanted to move back to Android after almost 3 years using my iphone... Don't get me wrong, the 13 Pro is an amazing device and it still works amazingly today. But I got (what I think it's) a very good price on the Pixel 8 Pro with my phone subscription - €550. So I though it would be a good moment to try something new.First things first: the phone is great! One of the things I value on a phone is the camera, because I do use it a lot and it's great to have a good camera in your pocket all the time. And let me stress this out: the cameras on the Pixel 8 Pro are amazing. Always amazing pics with a single click, and the videos... Oh, the videos look like were filmed with a good gimbal. So yes, great improvement from my previous phone.Battery life could be better. Yes, this was one of the things I saw many ppl complaining about the pixels phone. Tbh, the phone holds up an entire day with a single charge, which is sufficient for me. At the end of the day I get about 10%, which makes me anxious, but it does not go from 10 to 5% as fast as my iPhone... New batteries, sure, but I had the impression my iPhone always went down super quick after 20% of battery life.I was a bit afraid to move from a snappy and responsive iPhone to something slower. And I am glad I have not seen differences in this department. I don't know if the Pixel will age as well as my iPhone did, but hey, 2 to 3 years is more than enough for another refresh.One down side comparing both system is the fact that apps on the iPhone are just *chef's kiss* Android apps tend to be a bit more dragged or just not that rounded. I could note the difference on daily apps I use, but not on my browser (Firefox). Instagram, email, and even Google Drive apps seemed better on the iPhone.""Ohh but they are releasing the Pixel 9 soon."" Yes, and I am glad I did not wait more for it. Release prices are always high, and I know myself pretty well that I won't spend thaaaaat much on a phone. So if this is not an issue for you, yes, just wait a bit more and buy the most recent one. If you like to ponderate like me, then get the previous gen with a good deal. I am sure there are new lower prices every week we get closer to the new one.So yes, Pixel 8 Pro is still worth it. I would say now more than ever, with good deals around the release of the new series./I almost forgot to mention I was totally in the apple ecosystem. I dumped my apple watch se for a pixel watch 2. I am also satisfied with it! Great experience using both gadgets together. It gives me more useful notifications than apple's, but I also have to fine tune what I find useful or not in my watch. One thing that I just loved from the combo iPhone + Watch is the ability to unlock the watch once I unlock the phone. This is not possible with the Pixel Watch, but not a dealbrraker."
"Positive","I tested the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS for a week - here's a detailed analysis and my own choice between the two.I posted some thoughts about the Apple iPhone XS in comparison to the Google Pixel 3 [(post here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9tnmm6/my_take_on_the_pixel_3_vs_iphone_xs/) and wanted to write a detailed final analysis of the two phones for everyone’s benefit. While this is what I came away with after a week of serious testing on both devices, I think any person could come up with a different decision depending on what they want to prioritize for their money. I’m happy to answer any questions for those still on the fence or curious about particular aspects of these phone’s performance.I’ve been an owner of both Apple and Android based products over the past 10 years and don’t really have a “fanboy” bias towards one camp or the other.For anyone undecided about these two phones, I’d highly suggest not only following MKBHD’s five pillars of a smartphone (build, performance, battery, display, camera) but also following his suggestion during a recent interview on SuperSaf TV about needing to prioritize those five for your needs and then making a decision based on that. For my needs, I rank the pillars in this order: performance, display, camera, battery, build. **PERFORMANCE**iOS and Android are best represented by these two phones. iOS with gestures is a very immersive experience. Although the lifeless grid of app icons still hasn’t changed, the experience on iOS is more practical and polished. Animations are fluid and the A12 bionic chip doesn’t break a sweat even with intense app switching and graphic processing. For me, Android is all about personalized minimalism. Although Samsung and One Plus allow more unusual customizations, I find that stock Android is true simplicity. The gestures  in Android Pie are a welcome change but I have to say they feel unfinished. The way in which one has to double swipe up from the bottom to get the app drawer to open (or one long swipe if you have a big thumb) needs improvement like many other details in the operating system. They say an update is coming but if you care about raw power, the RAM management issues clearly lead to apps needing to refresh before opening. Even a week in, I’ve seen some random stalls already in some typical apps. Apple’s iOS is noticeably more complete - albeit a bit boring. Android Pie has great possibilities but it just isn’t a finished product at this moment and I don’t have an interest in being a test subject while Google puts their finishing touches on the user experience.**DISPLAY**Both phones have great quality displays. The entire iPhone is maybe 1-2mm shorter than the Pixel 3 but it has a much larger and substantial display. The Pixel screen has vivid colors and doesn’t leave much to be desired - however, in low light, there is a black crush issue. I noticed blacks lagging to respond as they are turned off, which leads to the impression of black spots smudging as you scroll. This doesn’t happen on the iPhone panel at similar brightness levels. Also, I noticed a number of times that the extreme corners of the Pixel’s screen are not always accurate and responsive to finger inputs in comparison to the iPhone’s at similar points in the display.Both are solid but the iPhone exploits the total dimensions of the phone’s footprint for a huge screen (yes, even with a notch that I never even think about) that makes viewing media and text easier on the eyes.**CAMERA**I tested the hell out of these two cameras to the point my friends thought I was crazy. I didn’t trust the YouTube videos and needed to see results for myself in the world I see from day to day.Apple has made some serious progress over the last couple of years in the photography department and I think there’s a reason why every YouTube tech reviewer is comparing these two flagship cameras. First thing is first - for still photography, the Pixel is far more successful than the iPhone. However, with some extra shooting and some post-shooting editing, the iPhone is extremely competitive and sometimes even beats out the Pixel. There is one really important thing that you have to consider if you’re choosing between both phones - if you’re primarily using your phone to share photos to social media, where sizes tend to be smaller and where photos are primarily viewed on mobile phone displays, then the difference is relatively negligible between the two cameras, especially if you do any detailed editing. I spent some time editing XS photos to mimic Pixel and frankly, it just isn’t that hard to get close to a similar image composition. On the other hand, if you open up an image on a computer and zoom in to check details, you’ll definitely see the minor and sometimes major flaws in iPhone’s photos.I have found that Pixel typically sacrifices color and light accuracy in exchange for sharpness and dramatic composition. It’s pretty clear that Google uses computational processing to create images that use striking contrast to produce an almost 3D effect in how it layers shadows and colors. A side effect is that sometimes sunsets will be strangely subdued (while they should be vivid with color) or skin will seem abnormally textured (something a real camera typically doesn’t do). In contrast, iPhone aims for more realistic color but flattens out and heavily evens out images. Shadows on the iPhone tend to be reduced and in low light, there is usually a ton of noise and loss of data, especially on the selfie shooter. If video and audio recording is of serious importance to your decision, stop reading this and get the iPhone. The iPhone XS has a great microphone and rich 4K video with many shooting configurations. Pixel has better stabilization but it comes at a price - Google crops the image down so that it can work with the outer edge of the images in order to beautifully dial in stabilization but it loses visual definition in the process. Also without the computational photography, the video on the pixel seems like it comes from a sub $500 budget handset instead of a $800+ flagship. Pixel takes it for photos (if you want something ready to go on social media without editing) but iPhone is almost neck and neck with a little help from editing. For Video and audio, iPhone is leading the industry.**BATTERY**There is no comparison between these two batteries. iPhone’s standby time is absurd (losing 2% in 8 hours in my testing). I can fully charge the battery, use the phone starting first thing in the morning with a heavy dose of YouTube videos, Redditing, emails, phone calls, facetime calls, and still have 15-20% right before I go to sleep. With the Pixel, as you approach the late afternoon into evening, you’ll be dipping into the mid 30s with several hours to go before the end of the day. I think most heavy users will need to top off the Pixel to last through an entire day.iPhone outshines the Pixel with battery endurance but I should point out that the Pixel has far better fast charging than the iPhone. Also, screw Apple for not including a proper fast charger in the box! (Pro tip: get at 12W charger instead of the official fast charger for the XS. It’s virtually the same and costs less)**BUILD**Both phones are really well built. iPhone is over the top with its thick glass, stainless steel, and overall weight. I find the XS to be slightly too heavy for extended one handed use and also continually fear about dropping it. The pixel is so beautifully designed for the hand. It’s light, feels durable, and in general it is reminiscent of the Galaxy S8 but without the screen melting off the sides. Both have stereo speakers with solid volume. Pixel has some obvious bass vibration in the body of the phone. iPhone has beautifully tuned dual speakers and they generally sound better equalized and detailed in comparison to the pixel. While I’d like to call it a tie, i think the implementation of the larger display and speaker quality gives it to the iPhone. One side note: I noticed audio is generally better on the iPhone in comparison to the Pixel. /u/AmirZ pointed out this important piece of information in my last post and I wanted to pass it along here:>Android unfortunately upsamples from 44.1kHz to 48kHz by default, which can reduce the audio quality if your source doesn't support Direct PCM passthrough or Compressed Offload (if the music player doesn't decode to WAV). iPhone on the other hand is much smarter and uses the proper output sampling rate from what I've heard. So that might contribute to the worse quality. Also, the new Pixel dongle has a terrible AMP with only 0.4V output, compared to the 0.7V+ that is standard across other phones.**CONCLUSION**As you can see, the iPhone took 3 of the 5 categories or pillars without much of a fight. As I seriously contemplated this decision, I was desperately holding on to two things from Android - an industry leading still photography camera and a stock operating system - against everything that Apple offers at $300 more. This is where you need to decide what you’re willing to sacrifice. Ultimately, the loss of video recording with quality audio is a deal breaker for what I want from a phone. If point and shoot photography and Google services and/or customization is your priority, Pixel is a no brainer. It’s cheaper than Apple, takes ready to publish photos 8 out of 10 times (I’d call iPhone’s photos strong 5 out of 10 times) and the smaller Pixel 3 feels absolutely amazing in the hand. It’s snappy and will be at the front of the line in the Android world for updates for at least the next two years.But If you want a high power flagship that every competitor will try to knock down, the iPhone XS, like Samsung’s Note 9, gives you everything that you would realistically need. I’ll be first to admit that it’s less exciting to use than Android, but the elegance and reliability of the experience in combination with industry leading video & audio, makes it the phone for me for the next few years.**TL:DR:** The iPhone XS overtakes the Pixel 3 in a number of areas this year. Apple is more competitive in computational photography (look at the insane amount of camera comparisons on YouTube) than I would have expected. Google dropped the ball on a few things that matter to me when they're charging a premium price, so I’ll spend a little more cash and get something that every competitor will be measuring itself against."
"Positive","Pixel 4 (Smaller) review after a week.So I should start by saying I am a little ridiculous with phones, and over the last couple years have had (and ultimately sold/traded in) all of the Pixels (Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3 \[returned for terrible pink screen on multiple RMAs,\] Pixel 3 XL,) an S10+ and a OnePlus 7 Pro. I ultimately ended up taking my chance on a smaller Pixel 3 again when they were cheap and sold my 3 XL to cover the cost. I wrote up a post on the OP7P and the Pixel awhile back which you can read here if interested [https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bsvk2n/some\_thoughts\_on\_the\_oneplus\_7\_pro\_vs\_pixel\_3\_xl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bsvk2n/some_thoughts_on_the_oneplus_7_pro_vs_pixel_3_xl/). I also have access to the latest iPhones as my partner is in the iOS ecosystem, so I was able to compare them all to the iPhone X, XS, and 11 Pro.I pre-ordered the 64 GB Pixel 4 Clearly White from T-Mobile on 10/16 when they went live, and it was delivered 10/22, so this is based on about a week of usage. The reason I purchased from T-Mobile rather than Google directly was that with their “On Us” promo I was able to add a line, port a number (set up a dummy Google account to get a voice number) and trade in my Pixel 3 to get it for free (well, for the cost of taxes on it.)To go backwards from the conclusion - I am very impressed with the phone, and plan on keeping it at least until I see what comes out next year. Below I will outline the main reasons why, which hopefully help anyone else on the fence about getting one. I assume most of this will apply to the larger XL as well, but it will have better battery life.**The performance problems from the 3 are entirely absent.** Possibly because of the additional memory, but more likely due to the absence of whatever issue the 3 had, the performance of the 4, specifically the app management, is night and day better. The issues I had with the 3, which persisted until now despite multiple updates, are completely absent. This includes the aggressive closing of background apps, sluggishness when connected to Android Auto, maps and music closing in the background for no reason, and general wonkiness of the 3. These issues were present since day one on every 3/3XL I had, and only marginally improved with updates, but are entirely gone on the 4. The 4 is snappy at all times and feels like the OnePus 7 Pro did. I was particularly surprised to notice that when I opened a game (Dx2 if you are curious) a day after last opening it, it was still “live.” Maps and music do not close in the background, and the device is just as speedy as ever even when connected to Android Auto. It is consistently fast and smooth, and while I guess this could degrade over time, that wasn’t the case with the original Pixel or 2 series, and the 3 was janky from day one. So I am super impressed. This is probably the biggest thing for me. The reason I kept trying other devices (the S10+, the OP7P, and even an iPhone) was because the performance was just so painfully annoying. I am thrilled to say that so far the 4 has performed great.**The hardware look and feel.** As a physical object, it is beautiful and a similar leap in quality from the Pixel to Pixel 2 to Pixel 3. It does feel more premium than the 3. Comparing it to an iPhone 11 Pro, it looks and feels every bit as polished and premium. The camera bump is also much nicer looking than the one on the iPhone as the cameras are sort of hidden in the black glass. The Pixel 4 begs to be kept out of a case because the texture on the sides and back just feel so lovely, and the (mercifully flat) glass feels great when swiping in for the back gesture. That said, I’ve put mine in the official fabric case, which I’ve loved on my previous Pixels. The speaker quality is great, and despite the move to one front facing and two bottom firing speakers, it sounds just as loud and clear (maybe a bit bassier) than the 3. Call quality has been great, and lacks the weird electric crackle I sometimes heard on my previous Pixel 3, and reception (on T-Mobile) has been comparable to the 3 and an iPhone 11 Pro.**The camera.** I honestly can’t comment too much on this as I haven’t taken a ton of pictures in the last week. I will say the new optically improved zoom is incredible, and pictures taken at 8x are usable in a way they are not with other phones including those with telephoto lenses. While I can’t speak to the normal shots, reviewers seem to have concluded that its at the level of (but unfortunately not better than) the iPhone 11 Pro. One thing that I’ve observed and found interesting that I haven’t seen mentioned too much is the changes to the “Pixel look” and where those changes came from. Photos seem to be less contrasty and warmer than the previous Pixels - but what I think is really interesting is that when the device was announced they had a brief segment with Annie Leibovitz, who is arguably one of the most prominent photographers of our time. They had her using a Pixel 3 and then 4 for an entire year, and providing feedback to the team - which I believe is reflected in the refined “look” of these shots. So while maybe the quality of the Pixel 4 photos are comparable to the iPhone 11 Pro, I do think there is something to be said for the fact that the style of them was influenced by such a prolific photographer. Switching gears a little bit, I have not used astrophotography but can’t wait to just because it is a cool feature to have.**The “new” stuff.** Motion sense is underwhelming but I feel like that is almost entirely the fault of marketing it, not the actual technology. Face unlock is stupid fast, and the ability for the phone to turn on the AOD when you are near, and start the unlock process when you reach for it, are magical experiences that just seem like the future. It honestly makes picking up and unlocking an iPhone feel old. The swiping to skip tracks stuff? Meh. I haven’t used it in a week. I could see times (cooking for example, driving if its in a mount) where I might, but overall it just isn’t something super useful. Lowering/silencing alarms and calls is more magical feeling but not a killer feature. I genuinely think that Google should have not included the swipe to skip gestures and marketed motion sense as anything other than presence detection and part of the new unlocking system. They could have added the swiping back in an update as an added bonus, but the decision to hype the limited and unnecessary aspects has hurt the phone’s reception. I think it is a valuable addition for the magic it ads to every day interactions, but not for the gimmicky air controls. On the subject of face unlock, it works great and is fast as hell. I thought I would miss the fingerprint sensor but I haven’t - but if you login to financial apps regularly enough that typing a pin will be annoying you may want to wait until more apps support it. The password manager that I use already uses it so logging into anything else is a breeze. The screen is stunning and feels like they finally got it right after years. I had so many problems with the Pixel 3 screen that I went through numerous RMAs and ultimately got a 3 XL because I couldn’t seem to get a smaller one with a screen that wasn’t terrible. The 2 had its own problems with displays, and while the original Pixel screens were fine they were tiny and had large bezels given the competition. The screen on the 4 lacks the issues of the previous generation (or I got really lucky.) There is no pink shift on one half or side of the screen, there is not a grain look under white/light grey colors, there is not a color or tone shift when you have a dark grey image on the screen, there is not black crush when scrolling, and there are no dead pixels or debris under the actual screen (all issues I had with my 2 and 3… yes apparently I’m a glutton for punishment.)**And finally… the battery.** I don’t know if I am just biased or have low expectations… but it’s fine? For example, when writing this, I took it off the charger at 6:20 AM when I got up. It was plugged in my car for about 10 minutes while I drove to work. It is now 3, and I have 55% with an hour of screen on time. In the last week it hasn’t died once, and I’ve probably seen about 4 hours screen on time on average. I don’t charge it at home or work during the day, but it typically will get another 10-20 minutes in my car depending on traffic. This to me seems… fine? I was listening to a podcast recently about the Pixel 4 reviews (maybe Android Central?) and they were saying it is shocking that with all of their analytics Google still chose to include such a small battery… but I think that is exactly why they did. Depending on the study, the average person is looking at their phone 3-4 hours a day. The Pixel 4 will easily handle that. Is that enough for a power user? Probably not. Is it enough for the average person? Absolutely. It also feels very similar, though slightly better, to the Pixel 3.**Update:** I'm deliberately trying to kill the battery today , so far at around 10 AM I am at 53% with 3h5m SOT. This would trend to over 6 hours SOT, but I will update again when it gets closer to dead.**Update: Died at 2 PM. Off charger since 6:20 AM. 7h SOT on time on full charge.** **The 3 lensed elephant in the room.** I firmly believe that the two largest reasons for the negative reviews (relatively negative at least) of the Pixel 4 have to do with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The Pixel 3 had less battery life than the Pixel 4, but was not critically panned for it. But this year the iPhone made the phones bigger and added hours of battery, so now its a pain point for Pixel. I’m not saying this is an invalid criticism - it absolutely is valid, and if you are considering an iPhone 11 or a Pixel, it will matter to you - but I am saying that if you were content with a Pixel, Pixel 2 or Pixel 3’s battery life, you will be content with this. The ultra-wide camera is a very similar critique. Up until now the Pixel has had the best camera with only one lens, beating out devices with three. But Apple has more or less caught up, and has added an ultrawide which gives you the ability to shoot unique looking shots - so the expectation is that Google provide feature parity with this. Again, I feel like analytics are probably part of this. If I look through my own pictures, most of them are people and animals. I do have an ultrawide lens from Moment that I used with my Pixel 3, and it did allow me to create some cool shots, but it is a tiny portion of the overall shots I took. I don’t have the data to back this up, but I would guess that most people take the most pictures of subjects that are not going to benefit from a wide angle lens - and in fact will look worse due to distortion. Does this mean Google shouldn’t have given people the choice? No! The Pixel 4 would be a better (and arguable perfect) phone with a bigger battery and an ultrawide camera. But for most users, I think that they will benefit more from a telephoto that allows for zooming in when you couldn’t previously (concerts, events, etc.) and allow for better portrait shots. I think the same could be said for the choice to include only one (wider) selfie camera and a smaller battery to presumably accommodate the Soli chip. The speed and intuitiveness every time you pick it up will make more impact than the few times you may use an ultrawide or need a little extra battery. This is just my opinion, but I feel many normal users would share it.**TLDR.** In conclusion, the Pixel 4 has incredible performance which avoids the issues the Pixel 3 had, a beautiful, quality, unique design, a stunning (and finally quality controlled) screen, the best camera on a phone (even if that title is shared with the iPhone 11 Pro,) and an adequate battery for most, especially those coming from a Pixel 2 or 3. The new Motion Sense hardware allows for a more aware and intuitive phone experience that feels uniquely Google and uniquely futuristic. Would it have been better with an ultrawide camera and a bigger battery? Yes. But that doesn’t mean what’s here isn’t great. I am super picky about phones and am looking forward to keep this in a way I haven’t felt since my original Pixel - the only Pixel I kept for a full year (don’t judge!)I am happy to answer any specific questions anyone has who might be considering getting one too, just let me know."
"Positive","My take on the Pixel 3 vs iPhone Xs.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","iOS vs. Pixel/Android: my experience.So I've been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback, and I think it's finally ready to share. This will be mostly an Apple vs. Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones. For context I went from Pixel 4a → iPhone 13 Pro → Pixel 5. I used the iPhone for ~5 months before throwing in the towel. These are obviously not all of the differences, but these are the ones that I found most “impactful” on my personal experience.In order from most impactful to least. Pros:- iOS is just way faster and more reliable. Apps work so much better and faster on iOS, and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts. Memory management is better, apps seem to never ever have to relaunch, Apple does more with less (software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware). It really does seem to “just work” for the most part. What it does do, it does consistently well, and things behave the way you expect them to. I haven’t encountered a single bug. By far and away the biggest pro. Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole. My Pixel 4a had a number of issues. The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue (presumably) that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call, making it unable to answer, and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call. And the fingerprint sensor did not work. I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again. WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 (just silence), and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether (mobile and WiFi) multiple times/day until I restarted it, which was also really fun to diagnose...- iMessage: Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones. Android has an equivalent product, but like many of their equivalent products, they have failed to proliferate. Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriers/OEMs fight over standardization, which means nobody uses any of them. It’s fine, but thanks to Apple, it only works on Apple devices.- Support: if you need help with an issue, unless you pay extra for AppleCare, Apple will direct you to their (mostly useless) online self-help resources, but worst-case scenario you can just walk into an Apple store (assuming you have one nearby) and they won’t  turn you away. When I was looking for a new phone, it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone. When I walked into the Apple store, this is what ultimately sold me. Their reps are super nice and eager to help. Google has “Preferred Care” via uBreakiFix, but it’s really not the same experience and there are no “Google Stores”, to my knowledge.- Video: quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip. I don’t think anyone will argue against that. However, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos, the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesn’t matter.- Ecosystem: If you DO have ALL Apple products, they work together exceptionally well. Android has some stop-gap solutions with Windows but unless you’re using a Chromebook (which comes with its own compromises) there is no powerful and versatile desktop/laptop solution. There is no good tablet or watch currently. There are options on the horizon but they’ve tried this before and failed.- Connectivity: I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone. The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones.- Battery life: It’s a longboi. Apple’s vertical integration allows for super powerful, but also high efficiency hardware. The battery will easily last me a couple of days.- Haptic Feedback: yes it’s as good as everyone says, it’s almost like a whole language, and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome.- Shortcuts: I didn’t really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature, but not super user-friendly. The fact that there’s a sort of “store” where you can simply install them is super-cool, and makes them more user-friendly. It’s pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a “Shortcut” is run. Android has some similar (but inferior) apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT, but nothing baked into the OS. Google has “routines” via Assistant but they’re incredibly limited in what they can do.- iPhones have 5+ years of software support. The latest Pixels get ""at least"" 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that ""may include feature drops"". Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record. Hold that thought though until we get to the cons.Cons:- Spam handling: As someone who receives about 4-5 annoying spam texts/calls per day, they just make me miserable. Firstly, and I’m not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app, but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database, so it gives you a sort of quasi-caller-ID (whatever happened to caller ID anyway?). Secondly, the Pixel has the Call Screen feature, and a robust SMS spam filtering service (not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call) that works really well. There are very few things I consider “invaluable” in a smartphone, but Call Screen is one of them. There’s nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined. You don’t even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filtered...or buy an iPhone. iMessage has…almost nothing. You can filter unknown senders/callers, and you can bring in other 3rd party call/message filtering apps but they don’t seem to work well, and are typically a paid service. When searching through Apple support, they just direct you to talk to your carrier. Blocking callers is like a 12-step process, and there's not even a way to mark them as junk. This was “the last straw” for me and why I eventually threw in the towel. I had a particularly bad day for spam. Like 10 calls/texts in the span of a few hours. Huge #1 con for sure, but that’s just me.- Notification handling and customization: On Android, notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance. Some can be silenced. The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone (if you’re right-handed). Persistent notifications are non-existent, and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about. After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE, OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade. FUCKING WHY!? The swipe gestures are difficult to use. Many times I try to do a horizontal half-swipe or whatever to get to the “options” menu to change notification settings, but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence. There’s no way to access notification history, like you can very easily and intuitively on Android, so they’re just gone forever. I’ve noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications, as they have a thousand of them, but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized. The notifications on iOS don’t disappear when I read them on another device (specifically Gmail) like they do on Android.- Keyboard: The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple, and something you interact with every time you pick up the device, is nothing short of astonishing. The Apple keyboard has a mind-bendingly stupid button-accessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals. GBoard on Android allows you to add a second long-press layer, add a number row, and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate. Swipe typing on iOS just…doesn't seem to work very well at all. Swipe typing on Android makes one-handed typing very easy. I can even do it without looking. The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it, where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away. SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears, but other times it doesn’t and it’s just very confusing and inconsistent. The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud, almost ear-shattering clack. GBoard has a nice sound, like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper. It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately. 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard.- Anti-right-to-repair stance: Does it really do any good to have 5+ years of software support if they don’t support the hardware? Apple is an industry-leader in preventing repairs of their own devices, and irreparable construction methods. They go to great lengths to ensure this, going so far as to serialize virtually every part, like camera modules, so they won’t work, even if you swap them from one iPhone to another. They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts (sold illegally) from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits. The agreements with Apple’s vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple. That means if you have a broken $5 microchip, you can’t easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device, at a price that is not at all cost-effective, in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one. Although they do provide cost-effective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries.- Custom notification sounds: This is a huge one for me, because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket, and whether or not I need to read/respond. This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what I’m doing. Not possible on most iOS apps.- No universal back gesture: This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone. It’s very intuitive and natural; if you want to go back, you just swipe from the edge of the screen. iOS doesn’t seem to have any sort of universal “back” function at all. Sometimes, you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right, but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this. Also, even when it does work, swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do right-handed. The Android gesture is ambidextrous.- Desktop messaging: More “walled garden” problems. In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer. On Android you can use whatever you want, it’s just done through the browser. So I’m forced to type on, and read from, my tiny little phone screen when I’m at home, on that miserable little keyboard, instead of my 49” desktop monitor and full-size physical keyboard.- Text selection: It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly, and for so long. I still don’t understand how it’s supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time. Long-pressing on the screen brings up a magnified view, which is promptly hidden by the finger you’re using to select when moving up. Moving this magnified view up/down on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue. It could even be tailored to right and left-handed users, but that type of customization is atypical of Apple. You can also long-press on the space bar, but the thing moves so damn fast that it’s incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it. It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down…- I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage. I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title. Instead I have to send through the contacts app, which makes it not even worth the effort. I just end up typing in my information, on that miserable little keyboard. I suspect this is another ""walled garden"" thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage, if you opt into it.- Weight: I guess some people equate a heavy phone with “premium” build quality. I’m of the opposite opinion. Pixel 5 is 151g vs. iPhone 13P 204g (35% lighter!). Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions. Most of this weight savings is derived from the (more durable) aluminum frame construction vs. heavier, more fragile “premium” glass.- No plugins for Firefox (ad blockers, dark mode, etc). All browsers are modified versions of Safari.- Face ID: Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen, which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android. This is not an issue specifically with Apple’s implementation of Face ID, but just the concept of Face ID in general. If you ask me, FaceID offers no benefits to account for this, and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor. Shortly after that, many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate (it's also just a more convenient location). Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived “progress” while actually being the opposite, in my opinion.- Default SMS: If, for example, you wanted to use Signal, on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person you're messaging is not using Signal. Not possible on iOS.- Stupid fucking lightning cables: Absolutely no reason for these things to have them, but you have to spend another $100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around, in addition to USB-C cables for other devices, for absolutely no reason.- Aesthetics: Pixels and Google in general just feel very “fun”. Very colorful, and the Pixel UI reflects that, with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default, and “Material You” that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at. iOS, on the contrary, is fairly “boring” to look at, and does not change on a regular basis, much less in the last 5? years.- Slow charging (7.5W wireless, 20W wired). Bit of a nitpick here since they’re more efficient and have smaller batteries, but many Android flagships are running 45-200W charging. My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless (with compatible charger, obviously). Not a huge issue either way for me, personally, as I’m never far from a charger for very long.- Siri vs. Google Assistant. Google Assistant is still just so so much better.- Cost: the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was $1k. The Pixel 4a I had previously, which is, in my opinion, superior, was $350.Conclusion: The iPhone works better but the Pixel/Android does more. I think that’s the most succinct way I can put it.Apple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability, efficiency, ecosystem, and speed but just flops on the easy stuff, which is such a shame. It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000% better. I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality."
"Positive","Some insights for people looking to switch to Pixel from iPhone (Android vs iPhone).1. Take time to explore and customize your settings. The default options aren’t perfect—you’ll need to tweak things, but once you do, this phone becomes the most personalized device you’ve ever used.2. RCS with iOS 18 has finally bridged the messaging gap between iPhones and Android. No more SMS headaches—if my texts send as SMS, I just remind my friends to update their phones. Photos send in much higher quality, and typing status and read receipts are awesome additions.3. Use KDE Connect [https://kdeconnect.kde.org/](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) to sync your clipboard between your Mac and Pixel. You can wirelessly browse your phone’s files from your Mac and share items like AirDrop.4. Battery life took about a week to settle. It was good but not great at first—now, it’s excellent. You really notice the difference once it optimizes to your usage.5. Gemini is miles ahead of Siri and keeps getting better. Gemini Live (full voice control) is amazing while driving. Don’t forget to activate your free year of Gemini Advanced—it’s like having ChatGPT that can also control your phone, home automation, and everything around you.6. I was surprised at how many of my existing smart home products support Google Home. Almost 1/2 of my devices weren’t compatible with Apple, now most are.7. Get the 256GB version if you can. I got the 128GB because the 256GB had a longer wait time, but it’s filling up fast. The extra space is worth it.8. Android Auto has grown on me, and I now prefer it to CarPlay because it’s more customizable. The main menu can still be a bit laggy, but it's smooth everywhere else. Features like pinch-to-zoom on maps, support for notifications from lot more apps, and a more customizable interface make it feel more advanced.9. Apple Music works great in the Android ecosystem, and I’m keeping it. Lossless audio sounds fantastic, especially since Android supports high-res Bluetooth codecs that iPhones don’t. It’s a great experience overall.10. USB-C is pretty much everywhere now, especially since iPhones have adopted it too. It’s awesome having just one cable for everything—your phone, laptop, and more, especially when you’re traveling.11. The latest generation of Android Wear watches is excellent. Don’t bother with last-gen models; the improvements in performance, and battery life make a huge difference. No more lagfest on my Galaxy Watch 7.12. Photos on Pixel usually looks better, with vibrant colors that pop, although iPhones sometimes capture more realistic colors and better dynamic range. Videos, especially when switching between lenses, aren’t as smooth as iPhones but still hold up well.13. Video editing is bad on the Pixel 9 Pro, and I assume it's similar with other Android phones. I tried a bunch of apps, just use your computer.14. Most apps are now on par with or better than iOS. Apps like Robinhood, Kia Access, and ClickUp work even better on Android, though some, like X (Twitter), still lag behind.15. I switched back to Android after years with iOS (iPhone 14 Pro -> Pixel 9 Pro XL). I was an early Android fan from the MyTouch 3G days and even used to be active as a developer in the modding scene. I left because of the jankiness and unreliability, but things have changed. Google is marching ahead with AI while Apple’s dropped the ball. The “it just works” vibe is finally here on Android, and universal standards like USB-C, RCS, and broader compatibility are making everything click. This feels like a major turning point in the ecosystem wars."
"Positive","Pixel 3 XL vs. Note 9 - My honest review/comparison.Hey guys, my name's AJ and this is my Pixel 3 XL and Samsung Note 9 review.This won't be a typical review you might see, I'm not going to dive into the specs or technical aspects or numbers of each phone, instead I'm just going to give my honest opinion and thoughts on each having used the Note 9 since release, and now having used the Pixel 3 for also about a week. Ultimately, one of these phones will become my permanent daily driver for the next year, so I'm really going to focus on the trade-offs and sacrifices each device makes in relation to the other. Because ultimately, that's what this will come down to. Not to what each phone has, more so what each phone doesn't.Having said that, it's gonna be pretty lengthy, so grab some food and a drink and let's dive in. Check the headers if you want to move forward to the respective reviews.&nbsp;#**Background**So let's start with some background. I was looking for a phone replace my Pixel 2 XL. Now many of you are probably thinking, why the hell would you replace a one year old phone? Well, my philosophy is that if I'm going to pay close to $1000 on a phone, it better be damn near perfect. The Pixel 2 XL was amazing, but it was far from perfect. It had several minor flaws that by themselves didn't warrant an upgrade, but overall made me eye upgrading this year. These included things like a lack of wireless charging, a mediocre display, and aging hardware, among other things that just made me feel like I was missing out for the money I paid.Any phone I chose had to be and feel like an upgrade in most, if not all categories, which ruled out possible contenders like the OnePlus 6, LG G7, and any imported Chinese phone (Huawei, Xiaomi, etc).&nbsp;#**Cue the Samsung Galaxy Note 9**#####The GoodI've usually avoided Samsung phones since the memory of TouchWiz still haunts my pure stock Android loving soul, but after doing some research and I decided to take the leap and pre-ordered the Note 9. I've had it since day 1 and have been thoroughly impressed and satisfied. Unbelievable display, fantastic battery life, top of the line specs, ridiculous amount of storage capacity, a super useful S Pen, and a pretty great camera, and I love Samsung Pay. Honestly, I've never once thought to myself, wow, this phone isn't worth the money. &nbsp;#####The BadHaving said that, it's not perfect, though it's closer to any phone I had owned before. My main gripes come down to the software.Firstly, coming out if the box with Android 8.1 was a huge downer, quite literally downgrading since I had been running Pie on my Pixel 2XL since the Dev previews first went live. The Samsung experience impressed me in a lot of ways, it's just jam packed with features and customization that almost makes up for the lack of Pie. But aspects of it also didn't surprise me, too. A constant barrage of notifications from random apps and monitors that I had to manually toggle off as they popped up. Lots of preinstalled bloatware, including king of the spyware itself, Facebook. Samsung's insistence that I use their ecosystem of apps means I now have two calendars, two calculators, two contacts, and two clock apps. One of the worst offenders is the stupid annoying volume limiter pop up. Goddammit Samsung, if I want to destroy my ears to Denzel Curry then that's my God-given, tinnitus-inducing right. And the most egregious software and hardware flaw of all: Bixby. Look. I tried. I really tried to give Bixby a try. It's great when you need it to operate your phone for you, to take a selfie, download an app, send a text. But my ideal digital assistant does more than what I'm able to do with my two thumbs. In that way, it just falls short of Google Assistant. And that's just my preference, but Samsung doesn't let you have a preference. It forces Bixby on you. It's literally embedded in the OS and it's hard, almost impossible to get rid of. And the dedicated button is the stupidest decision of all, especially placing it near the volume buttons. Even a month in, I'm still accidentally triggering it. It's honestly the biggest frustration in a phone that's so close to perfect.&nbsp;#**The Pixel 3 XL - worthy upgrade?**Now, having said all that, I was, am still, really happy with the Note 9, and it's absolutely daily driver material. But, the Pixel 3 enticed me. The leaks, the buzz, the hype or hate, it was an exciting phone. It had some things that worried me, things that would undoubtedly be a step down from my Note 9. After watching the Made By Google conference, I decided to preorder it and get it into my hands. If I liked it, then I'd keep it and ditch my Note 9. If I didn't, well then $35 isn't too steep a price to demo a phone for a week.And, well, here are my thoughts.#####The GoodIt's smooth. So smooth. Stock Android, oh how I missed you. Everything is so smooth and fluid, but more than that, it's minimalist and simple without being restricting. Instead of throwing a thousand features at your face, the Pixel 3 gives you the essentials, a few plus extras, and leaves the rest up to you. It's honestly the perfect balance and a huge step up for me from the Note 9. The lack of headphone jack didn't bother me before nor does it now, I've always preferred wireless headphones with mobile devices. Ironically I'm using the pair of AKGs that came with the Note 9 pre-order. Google Assistant is back, refined, and the new call screen feature is honestly one of the coolest features in any smartphone, ever. Solid battery life, now playing feature, super loud and punchy stereo speakers, wireless charging, and a flagship worthy OLED. Finally, the camera needs no more hype. It's honestly impressive how the managed to build on the already incredible P2 camera, and I think Google's portrait mode and Selfies are just miles ahead of Samsung's.&nbsp;#####The BadBut whereas the Note 9 is a near perfect device with some flaws, the Pixel 3 XL is a near perfect device with sacrifices. Obvious sacrifices like expandable storage and headphone jack aside, the notch is, well, it's there. It's ugly on camera. It's not noticeable during usage like any other notched phone, but I much prefer Samsung's thin bezels. Most annoying of all, the notch frustratingly eats up too much notification bar room. 4GB of RAM isn't really an issue when using the device normally, Google Maps aside, but it still feels restricting and it definitely shows itself when you have lots of demanding apps open. The gestures controls are a big ball of meh for me. I'm used to them, but I'm not happy about it. And $899 for 64GB of storage is near Apple-level absurdity, unlimited cloud storage or not.&nbsp;#But which one?The bottom line is Samsung does more with the Note 9. It has a better display, expandable storage, an awesome S Pen, and a bigger battery, while keeping it with a headphone jack and notch less. On paper, it should win hands down.But still the same time, what Google does do with the Pixel 3 XL, it does it better. Google Assistant is miles ahead of Bixby, and squeeze feature trumps a dedicated button. And you can't do Android smoother and more optimized than Google. The camera will come ahead most of the time, and has features that feel useful and impressive rather than gimmicky. The Pixel 3 is all-around a smarter phone.&nbsp;#ConclusionSo with that being said, which one should you pick up? Well, that depends on you. #####iPhone UsersIf you're coming from an iPhone and want the advantages of Android without sacrificing the seamless, smooth blend of hardware and software that Apple has perfected, then go with the Pixel 3. If you're coming from iPhone and want the full throttle everything Android has to offer in a premium experience, then go with the Note 9 or, better yet, the Galaxy S9, which offers 95% of the features for 60% of the price.&nbsp;#####Android usersIf you're coming from another Android, it's a lot tougher. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL, despite Google's best efforts, has become even more of a niche device to recommend. It makes so many sacrifices and has so much competition that unless you fall into the niche, you're better off with a Samsung or OnePlus. If you want the best software experience, the smartest AI features, and the best camera, and want to be the first for security and feature updates, then the Pixel 3 is for you. But if those things aren't important, or if having a headphone jack, best display, expandable storage, or beefier hardware are more important, then the Pixel 3 is one you can pass up without remorse.&nbsp;#####My new daily driver..For me, I fall into the former category. The Pixel 3 XL excels at what I need it to. It's smart, it's gorgeous, it has the best camera and cleanest software experience, and Google Assistant seamlessly blends in to all my other Google smart devices scattered across my home. The sacrifices it makes are ones that don't affect me, and I fit squarely into it's niche. It's not a perfect phone, it's not even my perfect phone, but it's as close as we can get this year.&nbsp;#Final thoughtsAnyway, I really appreciate you reading my review, especially if you read through the whole thing. These were my honest, unfiltered thoughts and you're more than welcome to disagree, in fact, I'd love to hear your thoughts below.Other phones on my radar I'm hoping to get in my hands soon are the Razer Phone 2, the OnePlus 6T, and of course, the Galaxy S10 when that's announced. I'll be doing reviews on all of these phones and more. Though I don't expect them to replace my Pixel 3 XL, I'm always going to keep an open mind. The perfect phone is out there, I just have to be patient.ed: sp"
"Positive","Anyone rethinking upgrading to Pixel 4 vs iPhone?.I have a Pixel XL and I think my last iPhone was a 4s.I skipped the 3, and even the 3a... with expectations to upgrade to the 4. Sure, it's not out yet... but now I am rethinking it all and tempted by the iPhone 11.- Standard+wide+telephoto camera that is getting rave reviews in all conditions. Even IF the Pixel 4 beats it out in certain situations, the margin of difference is so slim now... plus everyhting points to 2 on Pixel 4 vs the 3 on iPhone 11 Pro- Screen brightness! I have enough trouble trying to see/use the phone in bright sunlight... the iPhones seem to always handle this so much better- Smoother and more responsive overall - whether at the system or app-level.... my experience is that the iPhones simply always perform better.- Better/more refined apps... I think? I don't game at all and MOST of my usage is very standard apps, almost all of which I believe are far more refined on iOSBut then jumping the android ecosystem, there are a few things I think I'd miss...- I use nova launcher and love the gestures+icon swipes. Just lets you do more in less space... i.e. I have Camera and then swipe for Photos... all in 1 icon. Same with messenger/whatsapp, facebook/fb messenger, etc.- Android auto - I don't own a car that has android auto but the screen mode is nice... not sure if iOS has a screen-only driving mode, and it also sounds like google is changing the way screen-only works. Not sure if it'll be better or worse?- No default web browser - I use chrome across all my computers and I don't love that I am basically forced into Safari on iOS... plus I can't even get safari on my windows PCsI used to be a bit more of a power user of Android... and I still do more than average and have my own customizations and whatnot within Android... but these days my phone usage seems far more straightforward. I'm afraid of being disappointed by the P4.Anyone else have thoughts after the iPhone 11 Pro announced/came out? Did it make you reconsider getting an iPhone, or was there anything that solidified your choice to stick with the Pixel 4?"
"Positive","My experiences: iPhone 11 VS Pixel 4 XL.Hi all,Since everyone's sharing stories, I thought I'd share my insights and experiences with these two great phones.  I am an Android fan, and long time Pixel 2 XL user.  I think, like many, I was underwhelmed with the Pixel 3 XL and held out for the Pixel 4 XL.  So when it was leaked that it would have no wide angle, still average /sub par video quality, and unremarkable battery size, I was a little heart broken.  And then, Apple's 11 line was super hot.  Wide angle! Improved stills photography! LONGER Battery life! I don't think anyone can say that Apple didn't do a good job this year - they listened to their fans, improved where it was most wanted, and delivered a very good device, at a reasonable price, especially the 11.  So, being swayed by the mountain of great reviews of the iPhone and poor reviews from the Pixel 4 XL, I bit the bullet and switched to Apple and got an iPhone 11.  Now I'll be honest, it was a very good phone.  Some Apple-only features/apps were great (i.e. Notes got really good) and some were annoying (why do I have to swipe up on lock screen after my face unlocks it?!).  But after a month of using it, I just didn't feel satisfied.  Perhaps the hype was too high.  Perhaps I can't deal with iOS.  I don't know.  So on Black \~\~Friday\~\~ Sunday I ordered a Pixel 4 XL.  And let me tell you, it felt great coming back home.  But then after a few days of using it, I realized, it felt \*too\* familiar, like the changes weren't really that big.  Had I made another mistake?  Here are some points of comparisons.\*\*Camera - Photography\*\* - For still photography the Pixel 4 still reigns king.  People are saying the iPhone is getting better and closing the gap - I wouldn't know bc I don't have a point of reference - but I'll admit, under good outdoor lighting conditions, the iPhone takes some nice shots.  The wide angle lens also makes for some interesting perspectives.  But the portrait mode on the iPhone I think is still pretty weak.  The Pixel 4 XL can focus and identify the whiskers on my pets, whereas the iPhone just bokehs them into the background.  Also, the Apple portrait mode is finicky, always needing me to move back / forward, etc, whereas the Pixel 4 just snaps a photo and boom! Instant nice shot.\*\*Camera - Videography\*\* - iPhone wins.  'Nuff said.  It's like Google didn't even try this year at all.  Shame.\*\*Battery\*\* - iPhone battery is just impressive.  I don't know how they optimize everything or whatever they do, the stamina difference is night and day.  I watch a lot of youtube videos and that just burns through the Pixel 4 XL battery embarrassingly fast.  Luckily I'm very rarely without a source of power to charge my Pixel 4 XL, but there's something ""safe"" in knowing your battery will last you through the day, and that's something Apple was able to do.\*\*Ecosystem\*\* - Love Android's customization and iOS has some cool features but at the end of the day, I go with Android because some of the things that Apple does is downright stupid (i.e. prior to latest update, you couldn't easily adjust camera settings in the camera app, without having to dig through multiple windows in the setting app - WTF).  Plus I don't know if I want to get ""locked in"" to iOS.  \*\*But what about Soli?\*\* I don't care to switch tracks or turn off my alarm by waving my hand. It's been an unreliable gimmick for me and personally, I would've taken it out to make the screen bigger.  Or make room for a bigger battery or a wide-angle lens.  I'm all for innovation but if you're gonna release a product, make sure it works.  There's way too many times I haven't gotten it to work and based on all the reviews, I'm not the only one.Overall, I really like the Pixel 4 XL, but it feels underwhelming.  If I didn't save $250 from Black Friday I think I would've had more buyer's remorse.  Every year, when Apple releases a phone, it always seems to be lacking something (i.e. 90 Hz screen) or introduce a feature that's existed on Android for years.  It seems to me, they toned down the ""Apple tax"" this year to make a product that could appeal to the masses.  Ironically, it seems this year that Google had adopted the ""Google Tax"" by holding back standard features that should apply to flag ships and charging a premium price - something that's out of Apple's playbook. I guess I just wrote this rant to try and figure out which one I should keep.  Any thoughts and insights would be appreciated!"
"Positive","My take on the Pixel 3 vs iPhone Xs.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","My experience in 1 month: iPhone 11 vs Pixel 4 XL.Basically in the title but I have both phones because of my job so I decided to see which one is best for me while also seeing what the reviewers were talking about with their weak points and their strong points. My previous phones were the Nexus 5, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S9+, OnePlus 6T, Galaxy S10, OnePlus 7 Pro.Display: So the Pixel 4 XL screen is better but not just because of the resolution but also because of the 90hz and color accuracy. I haven't had any of the green tint issues or the 90hz issues (YMMV) but the only thing that is a little sad is the brightness. I'm in Florida so anything under 80% brightness is hard to see in direct sunlight but it is visible outside just not as good as other phones out right now.With the iPhone 11, the resolution isn't an issue but I can tell the difference between the Pixel 4 screen and the iPhone 11 screen. The only thing I wish was on the iPhone 11 screen is the 90hz. Brightness is better on it and color accuracy is also really good but since it's LCD I can see that it isn't as vibrant or rich as OLED panels.iPhone 11: B+Pixel 4 XL: ABattery: The iPhone battery is better easily. While my Pixel 4 can last all day, it barely lasts all day. Now my Pixel 4 XL battery isn't average or bad like some YouTubers, it's actually comparable to my 7 Pros battery life and actually is better than my S10 battery life but the iPhones battery is just so much better. Apple really nailed it with the battery. I end the day most of the times at 40-55% which is insane. One day I ended the day with 65% which is crazy. iPhone 11: A+Pixel 4 XL: B+Software: I've had Android devices all my life but I've used iOS devices before and I've had an iPad and an iPod before while a lot of my friends have iPhone so I'm used to both but there are just things on Android that I prefer. The ecosystem with Apple is for sure the most cohesive you can get today with maybe Samsung as the 2nd best but the features that the Pixel experience comes with are just smart and mostly useful. Now playing, call screening,  live transcribe, Google assistant etc. On the iPhone, iOS is smooth and easy but the very little customization and the little quirks of iOS make me stay on Android. Gboard crashes on iOS so it makes me use the iOS keyboard. Having to go into the settings app for settings of system apps is annoying and I've had bugs and some slowdowns on some apps. On the Pixel I've had some hang ups in performance but the performance plus the 90hz has made it the smoothest phone I've used. The OnePlus phones I've had were the fastest but not the smoothest I've used. Also little side note, the speakers on the Pixel are the best I've heard on a smartphone and the haptics on the Pixel are 2nd best to the iPhone. Also 64GB base storage is the worst after coming from 128 and 256 phones.Camera: Now it might be my phone is faulty or something but my iPhone camera is really good but it is not the best camera for stills. My shots compared to the pixel 4 have less detail in many shots and they come out very warm to the point that it has a very noticeable orange or yellow tint. The ultra wide is great tho in daylight and night mode is also great but in the shots I've taken, the Pixel is still #1 to my eyes. Video is a whole other story. While video on the pixel hasn't been as good as the photos, it is still very usable and not terrible like some reviewers have said it is but the iPhone video is still the best with Samsung in 2nd. There's more noise in the pixel video at night and zooming on pixel video decreases the quality while also not having 4k60 as an option is sad. The zoom capabilities on the Pixel tho are amazing. I've amazed a bunch of my coworkers with the Pixel 4 superzoom paired with the telephoto and the portrait mode and night sight are still better than the iPhone equivalent.iPhone 11: A-Pixel 4 XL: ABoth phones are great that's the truth. One might be better for you compared to another person. To me the Pixel 4 is the better option especially with the black Friday pricing but the iPhone is still one of the best phones you can get on the market right now. There's just more things the Pixel 4 does right for me that the iPhone doesn't do for me."
"Positive","At this point, what keeps you with Pixel/Android (vs. iPhone)?.Hey folks, hoping to have an interesting discussion.I'm an Android fan by heart and my personal phone is a Pixel 5. Also have an iPhone 12 Pro from work.  Lately, I'm thinking about it more and more, while also giving my iPhone 12 Pro more use, I'm trying to understand what keeps me with Android and why not just switch to iPhone. Here are my main thoughts: 1. In my country, we don't have Pixels here officially, which make things more complicated if I need service.2. Due to point 1, Pixels are pretty expensive here. a Pixel 5 cost the same as an iPhone 12 (which has much better support and official stores)3. I have a Mac , iPad and AirPods. the way things work together is really good. Don't think you can find this level of integration on the Android side.4. Android is keep losing and taking features out. At this point, it's almost the same as an iPhone. 5. Cameras are amazing on both, but video recording is better on the iPhone.6. Comparing my Pixel 5 to the iPhone 12 Pro:    1. Screen is much better and brighter on the iPhone   2. Speakers are way better   3. Much faster processor    4. I know the 12 Pro costs more than the P5, but these points are valid for the regular iPhone 12 as well, so I figured out it's a fair comparison I would love you hear your thoughts and what keeps you with Pixel. Sometimes, I feel like an iPhone is just a polished Pixel.I really hope we can have a nice chats, while keeping any fanboism outside :) Thanks!"
"Positive","iOS vs. Pixel/Android: my experience.So I've been working on this for a few months and posted it a couple of times and got some helpful feedback, and I think it's finally ready to share. This will be mostly an Apple vs. Pixel comparison but for the most part goes for all Android phones. For context I went from Pixel 4a → iPhone 13 Pro → Pixel 5. I used the iPhone for ~5 months before throwing in the towel. These are obviously not all of the differences, but these are the ones that I found most “impactful” on my personal experience.In order from most impactful to least. Pros:- iOS is just way faster and more reliable. Apps work so much better and faster on iOS, and contain additional features that are simply missing from their Android counterparts. Memory management is better, apps seem to never ever have to relaunch, Apple does more with less (software is better optimized to make the most of the hardware). It really does seem to “just work” for the most part. What it does do, it does consistently well, and things behave the way you expect them to. I haven’t encountered a single bug. By far and away the biggest pro. Definitely other people I know have experienced bugs but most people seem to agree with this on the whole. My Pixel 4a had a number of issues. The most significant of which was a proximity sensor issue (presumably) that would turn off the screen when I had an incoming call, making it unable to answer, and making me unable to access the buttons in the middle of a call. And the fingerprint sensor did not work. I had it replaced and it worked again for a few weeks and then stopped working again. WiFi calling does not work on my Pixel 5 (just silence), and I had to disable the DNS because it was causing me to lose service altogether (mobile and WiFi) multiple times/day until I restarted it, which was also really fun to diagnose...- iMessage: Really only a benefit because other people I message have iPhones. Android has an equivalent product, but like many of their equivalent products, they have failed to proliferate. Perhaps a downside to the customization of Android is carriers/OEMs fight over standardization, which means nobody uses any of them. It’s fine, but thanks to Apple, it only works on Apple devices.- Support: if you need help with an issue, unless you pay extra for AppleCare, Apple will direct you to their (mostly useless) online self-help resources, but worst-case scenario you can just walk into an Apple store (assuming you have one nearby) and they won’t  turn you away. When I was looking for a new phone, it felt like there were no Android OEMs that wanted to sell me a phone. When I walked into the Apple store, this is what ultimately sold me. Their reps are super nice and eager to help. Google has “Preferred Care” via uBreakiFix, but it’s really not the same experience and there are no “Google Stores”, to my knowledge.- Video: quality is drastically better than anything available on Android thanks to the optics and A15 chip. I don’t think anyone will argue against that. However, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of the time when you share those videos, the quality is just murdered to the point that it really doesn’t matter.- Ecosystem: If you DO have ALL Apple products, they work together exceptionally well. Android has some stop-gap solutions with Windows but unless you’re using a Chromebook (which comes with its own compromises) there is no powerful and versatile desktop/laptop solution. There is no good tablet or watch currently. There are options on the horizon but they’ve tried this before and failed.- Connectivity: I seemed to always have service interruptions and weird quirks and bugs with every Android phone. The iPhone was exceptional in that regard and I had service in many places I did not with other phones.- Battery life: It’s a longboi. Apple’s vertical integration allows for super powerful, but also high efficiency hardware. The battery will easily last me a couple of days.- Haptic Feedback: yes it’s as good as everyone says, it’s almost like a whole language, and the ability to customize your own haptic feedback is pretty awesome.- Shortcuts: I didn’t really get around to using these but it is quite a neat feature, but not super user-friendly. The fact that there’s a sort of “store” where you can simply install them is super-cool, and makes them more user-friendly. It’s pretty annoying that a notification pops up each time a “Shortcut” is run. Android has some similar (but inferior) apps like Macrodroid and IFTTT, but nothing baked into the OS. Google has “routines” via Assistant but they’re incredibly limited in what they can do.- iPhones have 5+ years of software support. The latest Pixels get ""at least"" 3 years for OS updates and 5 years for security updates that ""may include feature drops"". Most Android phones are lucky to get 2 but Pixels have a good track record. Hold that thought though until we get to the cons.Cons:- Spam handling: As someone who receives about 4-5 annoying spam texts/calls per day, they just make me miserable. Firstly, and I’m not sure if this is particular to the Pixel or just the Google phone app, but Google runs any incoming calls against their Google Maps database, so it gives you a sort of quasi-caller-ID (whatever happened to caller ID anyway?). Secondly, the Pixel has the Call Screen feature, and a robust SMS spam filtering service (not to mention Hold For Me and Direct My Call) that works really well. There are very few things I consider “invaluable” in a smartphone, but Call Screen is one of them. There’s nothing more satisfying than looking down at a silent notification and seeing that some spammer or robocall was screened and declined. You don’t even realize how well the SMS filter works until you go into the spam folder and look at all the messages it filtered...or buy an iPhone. iMessage has…almost nothing. You can filter unknown senders/callers, and you can bring in other 3rd party call/message filtering apps but they don’t seem to work well, and are typically a paid service. When searching through Apple support, they just direct you to talk to your carrier. Blocking callers is like a 12-step process, and there's not even a way to mark them as junk. This was “the last straw” for me and why I eventually threw in the towel. I had a particularly bad day for spam. Like 10 calls/texts in the span of a few hours. Huge #1 con for sure, but that’s just me.- Notification handling and customization: On Android, notifications are automatically sorted and grouped according to importance. Some can be silenced. The iOS notification pane again relies on the furthest possible corner of the phone (if you’re right-handed). Persistent notifications are non-existent, and I find this means my notifications are regularly missed or forgotten about. After a while I realized there are lock screen notifications and then there are MORE, OTHER NOTIFICATIONS when you pull down the notification shade. FUCKING WHY!? The swipe gestures are difficult to use. Many times I try to do a horizontal half-swipe or whatever to get to the “options” menu to change notification settings, but then swipe a little too far and it disappears from existence. There’s no way to access notification history, like you can very easily and intuitively on Android, so they’re just gone forever. I’ve noticed many people pay no attention to their notifications, as they have a thousand of them, but I manage them very closely on Android to ensure the important stuff was prioritized. The notifications on iOS don’t disappear when I read them on another device (specifically Gmail) like they do on Android.- Keyboard: The fact that after all these years Apple still does such a bad job with something so simple, and something you interact with every time you pick up the device, is nothing short of astonishing. The Apple keyboard has a mind-bendingly stupid button-accessed second layer for all punctuation and numericals. GBoard on Android allows you to add a second long-press layer, add a number row, and resize the keyboard to maximize screen real estate. Swipe typing on iOS just…doesn't seem to work very well at all. Swipe typing on Android makes one-handed typing very easy. I can even do it without looking. The Android keyboard also has a dedicated button to dock it, where on iOS I have a hard time figuring out how to put it away. SOMETIMES you can swipe down and it disappears, but other times it doesn’t and it’s just very confusing and inconsistent. The audible feedback on iOS is just this loud, almost ear-shattering clack. GBoard has a nice sound, like rubbing your finger on a piece of paper. It also has different sounds for the space and backspace buttons that legitimately make it easier to type faster and more accurately. 3rd party keyboards make typing a little better but still much worse than GBoard.- Anti-right-to-repair stance: Does it really do any good to have 5+ years of software support if they don’t support the hardware? Apple is an industry-leader in preventing repairs of their own devices, and irreparable construction methods. They go to great lengths to ensure this, going so far as to serialize virtually every part, like camera modules, so they won’t work, even if you swap them from one iPhone to another. They have also sent ICE to raid small businesses who are using OEM parts (sold illegally) from Chinese distributors and sent out cease and desist letters and threatened lawsuits. The agreements with Apple’s vendors preclude them from selling any of their own parts to anyone but Apple. That means if you have a broken $5 microchip, you can’t easily get it repaired anywhere and Apple will tell you you need to replace the entire device, at a price that is not at all cost-effective, in an effort to get you to trash it and buy a new one. Although they do provide cost-effective solutions for common replacements like screens and batteries.- Custom notification sounds: This is a huge one for me, because I can tell the priority level of any notification without pulling the phone out of my pocket, and whether or not I need to read/respond. This helps tremendously for me to maintain focus on what I’m doing. Not possible on most iOS apps.- No universal back gesture: This is something I used on Android every time I picked up the phone. It’s very intuitive and natural; if you want to go back, you just swipe from the edge of the screen. iOS doesn’t seem to have any sort of universal “back” function at all. Sometimes, you can swipe from the left of the screen to the right, but it is inconsistent as to when you can do this. Also, even when it does work, swiping left to right is not the easiest thing to do right-handed. The Android gesture is ambidextrous.- Desktop messaging: More “walled garden” problems. In order to use a desktop client you must have an Apple computer. On Android you can use whatever you want, it’s just done through the browser. So I’m forced to type on, and read from, my tiny little phone screen when I’m at home, on that miserable little keyboard, instead of my 49” desktop monitor and full-size physical keyboard.- Text selection: It boggles my mind that something so simple can be implemented so poorly, and for so long. I still don’t understand how it’s supposed to work because it seems to do something different every time. Long-pressing on the screen brings up a magnified view, which is promptly hidden by the finger you’re using to select when moving up. Moving this magnified view up/down on the screen and enlarging it seems like a super obvious and simple fix to this issue. It could even be tailored to right and left-handed users, but that type of customization is atypical of Apple. You can also long-press on the space bar, but the thing moves so damn fast that it’s incredibly difficult to get the cursor where you want it. It seems the obvious and simple fix is just to slow it down…- I can send fucking memojis and Venmo payments but contacts cannot be sent from within iMessage. I used this daily in Google Messages instead of typing out my name and title. Instead I have to send through the contacts app, which makes it not even worth the effort. I just end up typing in my information, on that miserable little keyboard. I suspect this is another ""walled garden"" thing because it will send it automatically through iMessage, if you opt into it.- Weight: I guess some people equate a heavy phone with “premium” build quality. I’m of the opposite opinion. Pixel 5 is 151g vs. iPhone 13P 204g (35% lighter!). Keep in mind both of these devices are very close in external dimensions. Most of this weight savings is derived from the (more durable) aluminum frame construction vs. heavier, more fragile “premium” glass.- No plugins for Firefox (ad blockers, dark mode, etc). All browsers are modified versions of Safari.- Face ID: Face ID means you have a notch in the top of your screen, which takes up the space used by persistent notifications in Android. This is not an issue specifically with Apple’s implementation of Face ID, but just the concept of Face ID in general. If you ask me, FaceID offers no benefits to account for this, and they figured out biometric verification with the iPhone 5s fingerprint sensor. Shortly after that, many Android OEMs moved the sensor to the back of the phone to free up screen real estate (it's also just a more convenient location). Anything and everything after that has just been an attempt at perceived “progress” while actually being the opposite, in my opinion.- Default SMS: If, for example, you wanted to use Signal, on Android you can set it as the default messenger and it will just default to SMS if the person you're messaging is not using Signal. Not possible on iOS.- Stupid fucking lightning cables: Absolutely no reason for these things to have them, but you have to spend another $100 on a whole set of new cables you have to carry around, in addition to USB-C cables for other devices, for absolutely no reason.- Aesthetics: Pixels and Google in general just feel very “fun”. Very colorful, and the Pixel UI reflects that, with beautiful preloaded wallpapers that regularly rotate themselves out by default, and “Material You” that gives you lots of fun colors and just generally being really nice to look at. iOS, on the contrary, is fairly “boring” to look at, and does not change on a regular basis, much less in the last 5? years.- Slow charging (7.5W wireless, 20W wired). Bit of a nitpick here since they’re more efficient and have smaller batteries, but many Android flagships are running 45-200W charging. My Pixel 5 is only 18W wired but 12W wireless (with compatible charger, obviously). Not a huge issue either way for me, personally, as I’m never far from a charger for very long.- Siri vs. Google Assistant. Google Assistant is still just so so much better.- Cost: the iPhone 13 Pro I bought was $1k. The Pixel 4a I had previously, which is, in my opinion, superior, was $350.Conclusion: The iPhone works better but the Pixel/Android does more. I think that’s the most succinct way I can put it.Apple really nails the difficult stuff like reliability, efficiency, ecosystem, and speed but just flops on the easy stuff, which is such a shame. It would be very easy for them to make the iPhone 1000% better. I will deal with the occasional bugs to achieve greater functionality."
"Positive","24 Hours in Pixel 7 Pro.Hi everyone, thank you for your help last week answering some questions I had as a somewhat technical person who has been in the Apple ecosystem for a decade, but giving the Google Pixel 7 Pro a try.  My technical summary:&#x200B;HOLY.  CRAP.&#x200B;I feel stupid for waiting this long.  I originally decided to make the change as my car can allow me to use my phone as a key, but only if its an Android w/ NFC.  Some of the other functionality, just SMALL things, is blowing my mind.  A few examples:* Smart enough to take care of OTPs itself, deleting them after 24 hours.  I get to avoid a thousand messages of old OTPs that I neglected to delete.* The phone to Windows PC is seamless - I did have a Macbook a while ago and it was nice to be able to address texts and calls from the laptop.  Works just as well on Windows PC with the Android phone.* Forgot how much I missed fingerprint scanning.  It doesn't work sometimes, but I think its just how I'm holding the phone (and I can enter a few more fingerprint credentials in to help that).  It works a lot better than some of the messages here suggested, but I know there have been patches so perhaps that's part of it.  In any event I'm going to rack it up as a net positive.* As I mentioned, I'm fairly entrenched in the Apple ecosystem (Apple HomePods, family has iPhones and use Apple services, etc.).  Happy to report it wasn't as painful as I expected.  Apple Music works PERFECTLY on the Pixel and from the car.  I just have to tell Google to shuffle the TheGrumpyGent playlist, and it knows to crack open Apple Music and play away.  While I can't directly control the HomePods, they already know my account and voice so they play music fine (and is pretty much all we use them for).  Dumb for not thinking expecting it but HomeKit devices work just fine being added to Google Home at the same time.  I can change thermostats, turn on/off lights, etc. with no problems.&#x200B;There have been a few hiccups that are fine with me / minor annoyances, listing them here not to complain but in case there's something obvious I'm missing to fix them:* I ended up switching the whole family to use Google Calendar.  On iPhone, you can have the Apple Calendar app use a 3rd party calendar as primary and just turn off the iCloud one (you just lose push updates, they now get refreshed every 30 minutes).  I couldn't figure out how to use an iCloud or a Microsoft Outlook calendar from the stock GCalendar app.* On that same topic, I had similar issues with trying to use other Microsoft Office 365 services like OneDrive from the stock apps like Files.  I ended up taking the plunge and upgrading my Google One subscription and moved my data over (so instead of Microsoft invading my privacy its Google lol).  Having said this, the Gmailify service within Gmail is insanely good - It lets you link in another mail service and present email, reply etc. from Gmail but everything is handled and stored from your other account.  I'll also say the features from the Google services like Photos are incredible as well, but that's a separate discussion.* I think I'm going to be SOL for now w/ regards to a smart watch.  I really would rather keep to a single ecosystem and the Pixel Watch so far doesn't seem to be doing very well w/ battery.  I'd be replacing an Apple Watch Series 6 which is excellent.* I have to do a lot of travel for work and personal stuff, its maddening that Google Calendar doesnt' provide any means of getting alerts when its time to leave for a calendar event, or to have the notification come to you 15 minutes before you have to leave due to traffic etc.  Even Siri can do that.* The Google Pixel case is a bar of soap coated in vaseline.  Zero grip whatsoever.  I have a Spigen LiquidAir case arriving today, here's hoping it has a bit more to it.* EDIT:  One other annoyance is for my work apps (MS Teams and Outlook).  In order to use them you have to download Intune Company Portal.  Initially pretty scary at first (as its my phone not a company managed device), however reading the documentation it appears what my company does see outside of the work apps is VERY minimal (device name, patch level of the phone, my account, and can manage the work apps in question).  And I can appreciate needing that info for a BYOD and the apps w/ work data.  Still was a bit jarring coming from Apple where that wasn't necessary.&#x200B;All in all I'm blown away so far.  There's no comparison with Siri vs. Google Assistant - The latter is truly a digital assistant that gets things done.  A lot of my fears of switching over have been proven unfounded and I don't have devices around the house I can't use.  And the device itself is pretty - It even fits in my front pocket still, which was another concern.  Thanks again everyone for the help last week.&#x200B;Oh, and yes:  Not having to carry around a bulky car keyfob is AWESOME."
"Positive","I tested the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS for a week - here's a detailed analysis and my own choice between the two.I posted some thoughts about the Apple iPhone XS in comparison to the Google Pixel 3 [(post here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9tnmm6/my_take_on_the_pixel_3_vs_iphone_xs/) and wanted to write a detailed final analysis of the two phones for everyone’s benefit. While this is what I came away with after a week of serious testing on both devices, I think any person could come up with a different decision depending on what they want to prioritize for their money. I’m happy to answer any questions for those still on the fence or curious about particular aspects of these phone’s performance.I’ve been an owner of both Apple and Android based products over the past 10 years and don’t really have a “fanboy” bias towards one camp or the other.For anyone undecided about these two phones, I’d highly suggest not only following MKBHD’s five pillars of a smartphone (build, performance, battery, display, camera) but also following his suggestion during a recent interview on SuperSaf TV about needing to prioritize those five for your needs and then making a decision based on that. For my needs, I rank the pillars in this order: performance, display, camera, battery, build. **PERFORMANCE**iOS and Android are best represented by these two phones. iOS with gestures is a very immersive experience. Although the lifeless grid of app icons still hasn’t changed, the experience on iOS is more practical and polished. Animations are fluid and the A12 bionic chip doesn’t break a sweat even with intense app switching and graphic processing. For me, Android is all about personalized minimalism. Although Samsung and One Plus allow more unusual customizations, I find that stock Android is true simplicity. The gestures  in Android Pie are a welcome change but I have to say they feel unfinished. The way in which one has to double swipe up from the bottom to get the app drawer to open (or one long swipe if you have a big thumb) needs improvement like many other details in the operating system. They say an update is coming but if you care about raw power, the RAM management issues clearly lead to apps needing to refresh before opening. Even a week in, I’ve seen some random stalls already in some typical apps. Apple’s iOS is noticeably more complete - albeit a bit boring. Android Pie has great possibilities but it just isn’t a finished product at this moment and I don’t have an interest in being a test subject while Google puts their finishing touches on the user experience.**DISPLAY**Both phones have great quality displays. The entire iPhone is maybe 1-2mm shorter than the Pixel 3 but it has a much larger and substantial display. The Pixel screen has vivid colors and doesn’t leave much to be desired - however, in low light, there is a black crush issue. I noticed blacks lagging to respond as they are turned off, which leads to the impression of black spots smudging as you scroll. This doesn’t happen on the iPhone panel at similar brightness levels. Also, I noticed a number of times that the extreme corners of the Pixel’s screen are not always accurate and responsive to finger inputs in comparison to the iPhone’s at similar points in the display.Both are solid but the iPhone exploits the total dimensions of the phone’s footprint for a huge screen (yes, even with a notch that I never even think about) that makes viewing media and text easier on the eyes.**CAMERA**I tested the hell out of these two cameras to the point my friends thought I was crazy. I didn’t trust the YouTube videos and needed to see results for myself in the world I see from day to day.Apple has made some serious progress over the last couple of years in the photography department and I think there’s a reason why every YouTube tech reviewer is comparing these two flagship cameras. First thing is first - for still photography, the Pixel is far more successful than the iPhone. However, with some extra shooting and some post-shooting editing, the iPhone is extremely competitive and sometimes even beats out the Pixel. There is one really important thing that you have to consider if you’re choosing between both phones - if you’re primarily using your phone to share photos to social media, where sizes tend to be smaller and where photos are primarily viewed on mobile phone displays, then the difference is relatively negligible between the two cameras, especially if you do any detailed editing. I spent some time editing XS photos to mimic Pixel and frankly, it just isn’t that hard to get close to a similar image composition. On the other hand, if you open up an image on a computer and zoom in to check details, you’ll definitely see the minor and sometimes major flaws in iPhone’s photos.I have found that Pixel typically sacrifices color and light accuracy in exchange for sharpness and dramatic composition. It’s pretty clear that Google uses computational processing to create images that use striking contrast to produce an almost 3D effect in how it layers shadows and colors. A side effect is that sometimes sunsets will be strangely subdued (while they should be vivid with color) or skin will seem abnormally textured (something a real camera typically doesn’t do). In contrast, iPhone aims for more realistic color but flattens out and heavily evens out images. Shadows on the iPhone tend to be reduced and in low light, there is usually a ton of noise and loss of data, especially on the selfie shooter. If video and audio recording is of serious importance to your decision, stop reading this and get the iPhone. The iPhone XS has a great microphone and rich 4K video with many shooting configurations. Pixel has better stabilization but it comes at a price - Google crops the image down so that it can work with the outer edge of the images in order to beautifully dial in stabilization but it loses visual definition in the process. Also without the computational photography, the video on the pixel seems like it comes from a sub $500 budget handset instead of a $800+ flagship. Pixel takes it for photos (if you want something ready to go on social media without editing) but iPhone is almost neck and neck with a little help from editing. For Video and audio, iPhone is leading the industry.**BATTERY**There is no comparison between these two batteries. iPhone’s standby time is absurd (losing 2% in 8 hours in my testing). I can fully charge the battery, use the phone starting first thing in the morning with a heavy dose of YouTube videos, Redditing, emails, phone calls, facetime calls, and still have 15-20% right before I go to sleep. With the Pixel, as you approach the late afternoon into evening, you’ll be dipping into the mid 30s with several hours to go before the end of the day. I think most heavy users will need to top off the Pixel to last through an entire day.iPhone outshines the Pixel with battery endurance but I should point out that the Pixel has far better fast charging than the iPhone. Also, screw Apple for not including a proper fast charger in the box! (Pro tip: get at 12W charger instead of the official fast charger for the XS. It’s virtually the same and costs less)**BUILD**Both phones are really well built. iPhone is over the top with its thick glass, stainless steel, and overall weight. I find the XS to be slightly too heavy for extended one handed use and also continually fear about dropping it. The pixel is so beautifully designed for the hand. It’s light, feels durable, and in general it is reminiscent of the Galaxy S8 but without the screen melting off the sides. Both have stereo speakers with solid volume. Pixel has some obvious bass vibration in the body of the phone. iPhone has beautifully tuned dual speakers and they generally sound better equalized and detailed in comparison to the pixel. While I’d like to call it a tie, i think the implementation of the larger display and speaker quality gives it to the iPhone. One side note: I noticed audio is generally better on the iPhone in comparison to the Pixel. /u/AmirZ pointed out this important piece of information in my last post and I wanted to pass it along here:>Android unfortunately upsamples from 44.1kHz to 48kHz by default, which can reduce the audio quality if your source doesn't support Direct PCM passthrough or Compressed Offload (if the music player doesn't decode to WAV). iPhone on the other hand is much smarter and uses the proper output sampling rate from what I've heard. So that might contribute to the worse quality. Also, the new Pixel dongle has a terrible AMP with only 0.4V output, compared to the 0.7V+ that is standard across other phones.**CONCLUSION**As you can see, the iPhone took 3 of the 5 categories or pillars without much of a fight. As I seriously contemplated this decision, I was desperately holding on to two things from Android - an industry leading still photography camera and a stock operating system - against everything that Apple offers at $300 more. This is where you need to decide what you’re willing to sacrifice. Ultimately, the loss of video recording with quality audio is a deal breaker for what I want from a phone. If point and shoot photography and Google services and/or customization is your priority, Pixel is a no brainer. It’s cheaper than Apple, takes ready to publish photos 8 out of 10 times (I’d call iPhone’s photos strong 5 out of 10 times) and the smaller Pixel 3 feels absolutely amazing in the hand. It’s snappy and will be at the front of the line in the Android world for updates for at least the next two years.But If you want a high power flagship that every competitor will try to knock down, the iPhone XS, like Samsung’s Note 9, gives you everything that you would realistically need. I’ll be first to admit that it’s less exciting to use than Android, but the elegance and reliability of the experience in combination with industry leading video & audio, makes it the phone for me for the next few years.**TL:DR:** The iPhone XS overtakes the Pixel 3 in a number of areas this year. Apple is more competitive in computational photography (look at the insane amount of camera comparisons on YouTube) than I would have expected. Google dropped the ball on a few things that matter to me when they're charging a premium price, so I’ll spend a little more cash and get something that every competitor will be measuring itself against."
"Positive","Pixel 4 (Smaller) review after a week.So I should start by saying I am a little ridiculous with phones, and over the last couple years have had (and ultimately sold/traded in) all of the Pixels (Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3 \[returned for terrible pink screen on multiple RMAs,\] Pixel 3 XL,) an S10+ and a OnePlus 7 Pro. I ultimately ended up taking my chance on a smaller Pixel 3 again when they were cheap and sold my 3 XL to cover the cost. I wrote up a post on the OP7P and the Pixel awhile back which you can read here if interested [https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bsvk2n/some\_thoughts\_on\_the\_oneplus\_7\_pro\_vs\_pixel\_3\_xl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bsvk2n/some_thoughts_on_the_oneplus_7_pro_vs_pixel_3_xl/). I also have access to the latest iPhones as my partner is in the iOS ecosystem, so I was able to compare them all to the iPhone X, XS, and 11 Pro.I pre-ordered the 64 GB Pixel 4 Clearly White from T-Mobile on 10/16 when they went live, and it was delivered 10/22, so this is based on about a week of usage. The reason I purchased from T-Mobile rather than Google directly was that with their “On Us” promo I was able to add a line, port a number (set up a dummy Google account to get a voice number) and trade in my Pixel 3 to get it for free (well, for the cost of taxes on it.)To go backwards from the conclusion - I am very impressed with the phone, and plan on keeping it at least until I see what comes out next year. Below I will outline the main reasons why, which hopefully help anyone else on the fence about getting one. I assume most of this will apply to the larger XL as well, but it will have better battery life.**The performance problems from the 3 are entirely absent.** Possibly because of the additional memory, but more likely due to the absence of whatever issue the 3 had, the performance of the 4, specifically the app management, is night and day better. The issues I had with the 3, which persisted until now despite multiple updates, are completely absent. This includes the aggressive closing of background apps, sluggishness when connected to Android Auto, maps and music closing in the background for no reason, and general wonkiness of the 3. These issues were present since day one on every 3/3XL I had, and only marginally improved with updates, but are entirely gone on the 4. The 4 is snappy at all times and feels like the OnePus 7 Pro did. I was particularly surprised to notice that when I opened a game (Dx2 if you are curious) a day after last opening it, it was still “live.” Maps and music do not close in the background, and the device is just as speedy as ever even when connected to Android Auto. It is consistently fast and smooth, and while I guess this could degrade over time, that wasn’t the case with the original Pixel or 2 series, and the 3 was janky from day one. So I am super impressed. This is probably the biggest thing for me. The reason I kept trying other devices (the S10+, the OP7P, and even an iPhone) was because the performance was just so painfully annoying. I am thrilled to say that so far the 4 has performed great.**The hardware look and feel.** As a physical object, it is beautiful and a similar leap in quality from the Pixel to Pixel 2 to Pixel 3. It does feel more premium than the 3. Comparing it to an iPhone 11 Pro, it looks and feels every bit as polished and premium. The camera bump is also much nicer looking than the one on the iPhone as the cameras are sort of hidden in the black glass. The Pixel 4 begs to be kept out of a case because the texture on the sides and back just feel so lovely, and the (mercifully flat) glass feels great when swiping in for the back gesture. That said, I’ve put mine in the official fabric case, which I’ve loved on my previous Pixels. The speaker quality is great, and despite the move to one front facing and two bottom firing speakers, it sounds just as loud and clear (maybe a bit bassier) than the 3. Call quality has been great, and lacks the weird electric crackle I sometimes heard on my previous Pixel 3, and reception (on T-Mobile) has been comparable to the 3 and an iPhone 11 Pro.**The camera.** I honestly can’t comment too much on this as I haven’t taken a ton of pictures in the last week. I will say the new optically improved zoom is incredible, and pictures taken at 8x are usable in a way they are not with other phones including those with telephoto lenses. While I can’t speak to the normal shots, reviewers seem to have concluded that its at the level of (but unfortunately not better than) the iPhone 11 Pro. One thing that I’ve observed and found interesting that I haven’t seen mentioned too much is the changes to the “Pixel look” and where those changes came from. Photos seem to be less contrasty and warmer than the previous Pixels - but what I think is really interesting is that when the device was announced they had a brief segment with Annie Leibovitz, who is arguably one of the most prominent photographers of our time. They had her using a Pixel 3 and then 4 for an entire year, and providing feedback to the team - which I believe is reflected in the refined “look” of these shots. So while maybe the quality of the Pixel 4 photos are comparable to the iPhone 11 Pro, I do think there is something to be said for the fact that the style of them was influenced by such a prolific photographer. Switching gears a little bit, I have not used astrophotography but can’t wait to just because it is a cool feature to have.**The “new” stuff.** Motion sense is underwhelming but I feel like that is almost entirely the fault of marketing it, not the actual technology. Face unlock is stupid fast, and the ability for the phone to turn on the AOD when you are near, and start the unlock process when you reach for it, are magical experiences that just seem like the future. It honestly makes picking up and unlocking an iPhone feel old. The swiping to skip tracks stuff? Meh. I haven’t used it in a week. I could see times (cooking for example, driving if its in a mount) where I might, but overall it just isn’t something super useful. Lowering/silencing alarms and calls is more magical feeling but not a killer feature. I genuinely think that Google should have not included the swipe to skip gestures and marketed motion sense as anything other than presence detection and part of the new unlocking system. They could have added the swiping back in an update as an added bonus, but the decision to hype the limited and unnecessary aspects has hurt the phone’s reception. I think it is a valuable addition for the magic it ads to every day interactions, but not for the gimmicky air controls. On the subject of face unlock, it works great and is fast as hell. I thought I would miss the fingerprint sensor but I haven’t - but if you login to financial apps regularly enough that typing a pin will be annoying you may want to wait until more apps support it. The password manager that I use already uses it so logging into anything else is a breeze. The screen is stunning and feels like they finally got it right after years. I had so many problems with the Pixel 3 screen that I went through numerous RMAs and ultimately got a 3 XL because I couldn’t seem to get a smaller one with a screen that wasn’t terrible. The 2 had its own problems with displays, and while the original Pixel screens were fine they were tiny and had large bezels given the competition. The screen on the 4 lacks the issues of the previous generation (or I got really lucky.) There is no pink shift on one half or side of the screen, there is not a grain look under white/light grey colors, there is not a color or tone shift when you have a dark grey image on the screen, there is not black crush when scrolling, and there are no dead pixels or debris under the actual screen (all issues I had with my 2 and 3… yes apparently I’m a glutton for punishment.)**And finally… the battery.** I don’t know if I am just biased or have low expectations… but it’s fine? For example, when writing this, I took it off the charger at 6:20 AM when I got up. It was plugged in my car for about 10 minutes while I drove to work. It is now 3, and I have 55% with an hour of screen on time. In the last week it hasn’t died once, and I’ve probably seen about 4 hours screen on time on average. I don’t charge it at home or work during the day, but it typically will get another 10-20 minutes in my car depending on traffic. This to me seems… fine? I was listening to a podcast recently about the Pixel 4 reviews (maybe Android Central?) and they were saying it is shocking that with all of their analytics Google still chose to include such a small battery… but I think that is exactly why they did. Depending on the study, the average person is looking at their phone 3-4 hours a day. The Pixel 4 will easily handle that. Is that enough for a power user? Probably not. Is it enough for the average person? Absolutely. It also feels very similar, though slightly better, to the Pixel 3.**Update:** I'm deliberately trying to kill the battery today , so far at around 10 AM I am at 53% with 3h5m SOT. This would trend to over 6 hours SOT, but I will update again when it gets closer to dead.**Update: Died at 2 PM. Off charger since 6:20 AM. 7h SOT on time on full charge.** **The 3 lensed elephant in the room.** I firmly believe that the two largest reasons for the negative reviews (relatively negative at least) of the Pixel 4 have to do with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. The Pixel 3 had less battery life than the Pixel 4, but was not critically panned for it. But this year the iPhone made the phones bigger and added hours of battery, so now its a pain point for Pixel. I’m not saying this is an invalid criticism - it absolutely is valid, and if you are considering an iPhone 11 or a Pixel, it will matter to you - but I am saying that if you were content with a Pixel, Pixel 2 or Pixel 3’s battery life, you will be content with this. The ultra-wide camera is a very similar critique. Up until now the Pixel has had the best camera with only one lens, beating out devices with three. But Apple has more or less caught up, and has added an ultrawide which gives you the ability to shoot unique looking shots - so the expectation is that Google provide feature parity with this. Again, I feel like analytics are probably part of this. If I look through my own pictures, most of them are people and animals. I do have an ultrawide lens from Moment that I used with my Pixel 3, and it did allow me to create some cool shots, but it is a tiny portion of the overall shots I took. I don’t have the data to back this up, but I would guess that most people take the most pictures of subjects that are not going to benefit from a wide angle lens - and in fact will look worse due to distortion. Does this mean Google shouldn’t have given people the choice? No! The Pixel 4 would be a better (and arguable perfect) phone with a bigger battery and an ultrawide camera. But for most users, I think that they will benefit more from a telephoto that allows for zooming in when you couldn’t previously (concerts, events, etc.) and allow for better portrait shots. I think the same could be said for the choice to include only one (wider) selfie camera and a smaller battery to presumably accommodate the Soli chip. The speed and intuitiveness every time you pick it up will make more impact than the few times you may use an ultrawide or need a little extra battery. This is just my opinion, but I feel many normal users would share it.**TLDR.** In conclusion, the Pixel 4 has incredible performance which avoids the issues the Pixel 3 had, a beautiful, quality, unique design, a stunning (and finally quality controlled) screen, the best camera on a phone (even if that title is shared with the iPhone 11 Pro,) and an adequate battery for most, especially those coming from a Pixel 2 or 3. The new Motion Sense hardware allows for a more aware and intuitive phone experience that feels uniquely Google and uniquely futuristic. Would it have been better with an ultrawide camera and a bigger battery? Yes. But that doesn’t mean what’s here isn’t great. I am super picky about phones and am looking forward to keep this in a way I haven’t felt since my original Pixel - the only Pixel I kept for a full year (don’t judge!)I am happy to answer any specific questions anyone has who might be considering getting one too, just let me know."
"Positive","Conundrum .Lately I've been facing a conundrum of pixel vs iPhone. I absolutely love my Pixel 8 Pro. It's not perfect, but no phone really is. I love the cameras, I actually don't hate how the app drawer works anymore, it feels snappy, I enjoy playing games on it, battery life works well for me, charging is fast, and I love Google assistant alongside having fun with Gemini. The issue comes in the form of connectivity/ecosystem, and certain apps.I have both an iPad and a MacBook air. I enjoy a lot of things about both products and will likely never use a different brand of tablet or computer again (windows has burned me). One of the things I have really enjoyed are some of the native apple apps. Particularly, I love the native Reminders app. I also love using time page by moleskin studio. On top of that I am a musician and use forescore on my iPad. So, my whole gripe is really that I can't create an ecosystem with my devices where I can use the apps I love and get notifications on my phone. There is no way for reminders to give notifications on Android as there is no app and browser notifications are not supported on mobile. Time page is also only available on iOS. I have tried different apps to replace these but nothing works for me like these do! They really improve my time and task management as related to my ADHD. I've tried a billion different ways to try and see if I can at least find a way to be notified on my pixel of certain notifications happening on my iPad/Mac. There is simply no way because apple has it locked down.Is it worth switching? Do I feed into Apple's plot to make me only have their devices? Or do I put up with the lack of integration and hope that I remember to remove to look at my iPad to check on my tasks and calendar? Does anyone have experience with Google assistant integration on iPhone? Side note: idk why but I hate Google calendar. Especially the mobile experience. It's super visually un-intuitive for me and feels crazy cluttered"
"Positive","My take on the Pixel 3 vs iPhone Xs.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","Question about Pixel Phones (maybe Android in general?).So, I'm lurking in this sub for quite a while now. First off, I'm using an iPhone for about 10 years now. In the last couple of years I managed to be on the slow path to get out of Apples expensive ecosystem. No MacBook anymore, no Apple TV instead normal PC, Chromecast, Alexa etc. I was/am looking forward to the 4a and thought this is the final step to leave Apple. What makes me anxious now is the fact that I read a lot about problems with the Pixels here. ""This is not working..."", ""Screen problems"", ""and that is not working after an update"" etc.. and a good bit of RMA cases. (I know, this is obviously the Pixel sub).My question is more like, are there really considerably more problems with the Pixel phones (or Android phones in general) than with iPhones? I don't want a substantial IOS Vs Android discussion, but I would like kind of an estimate from people who own both phones what they think about this? Stay healthy everyone!"
"Positive","Update on Returning my Pixel 7.You might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/y4gegp/returning_my_pixel_7_and_sticking_to_iphone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) aka ""Everyone hates Reddspark"" Anyway after having discovered things like the double drag down to get to the brightness setting and the swipe to go back I decided to give the Pixel 7 another week of testing before deciding whether to return it and go back to an iPhone or not.And the result? Honestly I've been flip-flopping on the idea. Personal Pros:- Ability to have my personal and work calendars side by side as widgets is mega useful-  The battery saver and extreme battery saver modes are mega useful. I survived a day of hiking and using Google maps using this mode and still had 50-60% juice left- got used to the fingerprint sensor and face unlock now so doesn't feel like an issue anymore - generally prefer to be in the Android ecosystemPersonal cons:- regular battery life seems poor. I find myself having to constantly ""think"" about battery life- I really don't like swiping to go back. It's hit and miss whether you get the right position - I don't like the single Vs  double swipe up top to quickly access key controls. The iPhone just had one screen you swipe down that had everything I needed Other minor points: - the phone feels less sturdy/premium in the hand. I found myself picking up my iPhone by accident which has a nice feel to it, and being dismayed when I realised it wasn't the pixel 7.- the lock screen controls for YouTube doesnt have timer info displayed and can't skip back and forward - I'm missing the ability to preview WhatsApp and Messenger messages by doing a long press on the message- anyone notice how the phone seems to get quite hot with any moderate to heavy usage ?So yeah going to decide today whether I return it or not. I'm someone that likes switching back and forth between Android and Apple. But this is the first time I've found myself appreciating how easy to use the iPhone is. Everything seems well thought out. Maybe it's because I'm getting old and I want things to ""just work"" without requiring much thought. But I also want to keep all my photos and files on Google not IOS and hate the stupid proprietary format that iPhone photos are in (don't know if Google is the same actually)And I absolutely detest the lightning connector and just want a USB-connection for everything.Anyway those are my thoughts. Have at it.Edit:Ok I finally decided. I'm going to keep the Pixel 7. Battery saver mode will be the default mode for my Pixel 7 as it's using the machine learning tech to optimize it for you. And I do not wish to buy any Apple products that use a lightning connection. In a year's time when the next iPhone comes out I may reconsider. I also played around with the photo tools and they were pretty neat"
"Positive","My experience in 1 month: iPhone 11 vs Pixel 4 XL.Basically in the title but I have both phones because of my job so I decided to see which one is best for me while also seeing what the reviewers were talking about with their weak points and their strong points. My previous phones were the Nexus 5, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S9+, OnePlus 6T, Galaxy S10, OnePlus 7 Pro.Display: So the Pixel 4 XL screen is better but not just because of the resolution but also because of the 90hz and color accuracy. I haven't had any of the green tint issues or the 90hz issues (YMMV) but the only thing that is a little sad is the brightness. I'm in Florida so anything under 80% brightness is hard to see in direct sunlight but it is visible outside just not as good as other phones out right now.With the iPhone 11, the resolution isn't an issue but I can tell the difference between the Pixel 4 screen and the iPhone 11 screen. The only thing I wish was on the iPhone 11 screen is the 90hz. Brightness is better on it and color accuracy is also really good but since it's LCD I can see that it isn't as vibrant or rich as OLED panels.iPhone 11: B+Pixel 4 XL: ABattery: The iPhone battery is better easily. While my Pixel 4 can last all day, it barely lasts all day. Now my Pixel 4 XL battery isn't average or bad like some YouTubers, it's actually comparable to my 7 Pros battery life and actually is better than my S10 battery life but the iPhones battery is just so much better. Apple really nailed it with the battery. I end the day most of the times at 40-55% which is insane. One day I ended the day with 65% which is crazy. iPhone 11: A+Pixel 4 XL: B+Software: I've had Android devices all my life but I've used iOS devices before and I've had an iPad and an iPod before while a lot of my friends have iPhone so I'm used to both but there are just things on Android that I prefer. The ecosystem with Apple is for sure the most cohesive you can get today with maybe Samsung as the 2nd best but the features that the Pixel experience comes with are just smart and mostly useful. Now playing, call screening,  live transcribe, Google assistant etc. On the iPhone, iOS is smooth and easy but the very little customization and the little quirks of iOS make me stay on Android. Gboard crashes on iOS so it makes me use the iOS keyboard. Having to go into the settings app for settings of system apps is annoying and I've had bugs and some slowdowns on some apps. On the Pixel I've had some hang ups in performance but the performance plus the 90hz has made it the smoothest phone I've used. The OnePlus phones I've had were the fastest but not the smoothest I've used. Also little side note, the speakers on the Pixel are the best I've heard on a smartphone and the haptics on the Pixel are 2nd best to the iPhone. Also 64GB base storage is the worst after coming from 128 and 256 phones.Camera: Now it might be my phone is faulty or something but my iPhone camera is really good but it is not the best camera for stills. My shots compared to the pixel 4 have less detail in many shots and they come out very warm to the point that it has a very noticeable orange or yellow tint. The ultra wide is great tho in daylight and night mode is also great but in the shots I've taken, the Pixel is still #1 to my eyes. Video is a whole other story. While video on the pixel hasn't been as good as the photos, it is still very usable and not terrible like some reviewers have said it is but the iPhone video is still the best with Samsung in 2nd. There's more noise in the pixel video at night and zooming on pixel video decreases the quality while also not having 4k60 as an option is sad. The zoom capabilities on the Pixel tho are amazing. I've amazed a bunch of my coworkers with the Pixel 4 superzoom paired with the telephoto and the portrait mode and night sight are still better than the iPhone equivalent.iPhone 11: A-Pixel 4 XL: ABoth phones are great that's the truth. One might be better for you compared to another person. To me the Pixel 4 is the better option especially with the black Friday pricing but the iPhone is still one of the best phones you can get on the market right now. There's just more things the Pixel 4 does right for me that the iPhone doesn't do for me."
"Positive","your reaction switching to Apple's ecosystem (2022-2023).I'm a long time Google phone user and deeply engrained into Google services. I'm pretty much ready to pull the plug.Their customer support burned me over something simple and it destroyed my perception on the company. It all has to go. It's now time to ad block everything.Google Fi, Google One, YouTube Premium, Nest Aware Security, countless Google Home devices, Chromecasts, Nvidia Shield, Android TV, and on and on. For those of you that were deeply engrained and migrated out of all Google services recently to Apple and other non-google services:What was your biggest challenge?Your biggest eye opener?What is your remaining nagging issues or things you miss?What is your biggest regret switching to Apple?I know there are a few Pixel/Android features that I will 100% miss that are not available, I just want to learn more before jumping ship. The playing field has changed a lot over the last decade, so I'm interested in the perspective people who recently changed ecosystems."
"Positive","Has anyone switched their entire ecosystem from Apple to Google?.So I have a Macbook, ATV 4, and was planning on getting the watch (for free) and iPad and some homekit stuff. But I'm not really impressed by the latest iPhones. I have a 6S now and the 8 isn't that much of an upgrade for me. And the X is nice and all but $1000 for a phone just to use the same stagnant OS? Don't know about that...So i'm looking at the Google Pixel 2. But then I'll have to look at the Nvidia shield, and the Google home and so on and so forth. I want to hear your experience if anyone has done this. I can't see myself sticking with iOS for too much longer but switching an entire ecosystem kinda makes me nervous. Not on the technical aspect, but more so if I switch i'm gonna be stuck with it for a while and I'm gonna have to make it work whether I like it or not. I've had a Nexus 5 before and I loved it, but the more I used it the more I realized that the ecosystems are the selling point. Well, that and it broke and T-mobile wanted to give me a 6P instead.So any thoughts?"
"Positive","Google ecosystem vs. Apple ecosystem.I know, this question has come up countless times, but I still haven't found a satisfying answer. I use the Google ecosystem for most of my stuff. I've got the Pixel 8, the Pixel Buds A-Series, a Windows PC and I'm going to buy the Pixel Watch 3 soon. But I just recently got myself a refurbished MacBook Air M1 after weeks of thinking Chromebook vs. MacBook. When using it, everything just feels perfect. The design, the OS, the hardware, everything. So maybe I should switch to Apple all together. On the other hand I really like Android and wouldn't use iOS if I can. So my question is, considering my needs below, what do you think?**Smartphone:** Just like I said I will definitely continue using Android and Pixels.**Desktop:** Both chromeOS and macOS speak to me, but I haven't found hardware as good as a MacBook yet, any recommendations?**Browser:** I like both Chrome and Safari, although I couldn't use Safari on my PC, so that's a bummer.**Word:** I use Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Is Apple Pages any good?**Cloud:** I use Google Drive but could switch to iCloud since both suit my needs.**AI:** I do not consider myself an AI-enthusiast, but having someone to answer complicated questions is nice. Has anyone tried Apple Intelligence and Gemini and can compare them?**Mail:** Both iCloud mail and Gmail would work.**Maps:** No specific needs, is one of them better?**Pay and Wallet:** I don't have any experiences with both options, same question as above.**Calendar:** I heard Google's better, but I really just have basic needs to organize my life at the bare minimum.**Notes:** I prefer Apple Notes.**Presentations:** Is Apple Keynote any good (again, just basic needs)?**Passwords:** I currently use Bitwarden, but want a more integrated option. Which of them is more secure and better integrated?And I do not care about my privacy or my data.  EDIT: A Chromebook is a laptop replacement. It can run Linux, Android and chromeOS aps and I wouldn't do anything that a Chromebook can't. It's funnily really just hardware limitations. And of course I can use Google services with a Mac or an iPhone, but that's not the point. I want a tightly integrated ecosystem where hardware and software talk to each other."
"Positive","Do you ever crave for that perfection.I know many people can relate to me, having that craving for perfection. Recently I started paying for few apps, including todoist and ynab, and hopefully gemini advanced soon. I really crave for that perfection especially in my digital world. I hate apple but at the same time admire it for giving its users the feeling of that ""perfection"". Am I confusing it for quality. Apple users definitely pay a premium at different levels, from paying more for iphone to paying more for uber, but I think most apple users get that feeling of completeness and perfection in the ecosystem, which is why they stick to it and which is what steve jobs envisioned. Does anyone miss it? I'm a pixel lover and I miss it. I mean I love a lot of Google, but you know simple things like a note taking where google keep is not just enough but apple notes is. Am I the only one who really feels like they want to stay wit Google but feels inadequate? Help me with your honest perspectives"
"Positive","Vertical ecosystem .Why is Google so ""wishy/washy"" about it's efforts to produce a complete and well integrated hardware ecosystem? I would truthfully like to see an installer to convert any Windows or Linux desktop into a Google apps client (the whole personal office stack) , have my phone, earbuds, tablet all be Google and not have to lower my expectations for usability. The current pixel tablet is awesome as a home hub but not a great tablet, the Pixel Buds A are( IMHO )better then the Pros, the watch is still a disappointment, poor health monitoring and too much bloat. Beyond good health monitoring,It only needs to let me know who's calling, show text messages, calendar events and when carrying my phone and wearing my earbuds, let me accept calls. Above all, it's battery life is laughable in comparison to my wife's Fitbit. Either beat apple or quit like M$."
"Positive","Got my Chipolo Points and Card for the Google Find My network.Last June, I pre-ordered Chipolo Points and Card and I finally received them a few days ago. Here's my experience with these Google find my trackers, which I'll refer to as Google tags in this post, as they rely on Google's Find My Device network.The initial configuration process utilized fast pairing, similar to how headphones from companies like Sony and Bowers Wilkins quickly set up on Android devices. During the configuration, you'll receive information about how this network operates and the required permissions.Within the Google Find my device app, you're given several options: ""find nearby,"" which will play sounds and provide hints as you approach the device, similar to how an iPhone 14 or 15 operates with an AirTag. You can also play a sound or share the device with a friend or family member. In terms of device settings, you can change the device name and category (bag, bike, camera, headphones, keys, phone, tablet wallet, or other); however, I couldn't see an option to change the ringtone or volume of the Google tags like you can with Tile trackers.Having a Google-listed device that supports this network will enable the new network options on your phone. However, my other Google Play devices don't have the same configurations. For instance, I can find options for locating offline devices in the Find My Device settings on my Pixel 7 (android 15 beta 2.1), but not on my Chromebook (chrome 126.0.6478.24 beta) or android-based e-reader (Android 11). The Find My Device app on my ereader shows the Google tags, but they're not present on my Chromebook’s Find My Device app.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don’t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them. If you have Nest devices in the house they do help locate your Google tags which is great as they say “your keys were last seen at 9:10 near bedroom display”, I’m going to guess that with Google TVs acting as hubs in Google Home soon this will also help find your devices/Google tags.The Google tags I have from Chipolo are nice but easily can be stained, I don’t understand why they went for a white colour as just rubber the keyring loop stained them.

For example, Chromebooks could totally be added to Google's Find My Device network. Apple users can track their Macbooks with the Find My network, so it'd be awesome if Google could do something like that for Chromebooks and even Windows laptops. Judging how someone got Quickshare on MacOS, we’ll probably see someone make it possible for Linux and Windows later on."
"Positive","Why is Google getting worse and worse with every Android update!?!.(my main point is in the last paragraph before that is a bit of context)So I have a Pixel 7 Pro, and in all fairness, I am very happy with my phone. Even though a lot of the so-called features or smart features are more of a gimmick in my opinion as they don't work even remotely close as well as they are shown in the promo and launch videos, but I am fine with that.My frustration comes from the direction that Google/Alphabet is been going lately to just try and copy Apple. I remember years ago Android had so many more options to customize your phone and I switched to the Pixel last year from a Samsung Note 9, a 4-year-old phone at the time, I was surprised how much more customizable my old phone was. Google was first to introduce a lot of customization, and options to have on your lock-screen in terms of widgets and different clocks and all that. Now you have 5 different clocks, but they are mostly the same just slightly different fonts so 3 and 5 colors kind of, which feels like nothing compared to the options others give you in the likes of Samsung and even Apple. Now to the most frustrating thing. So I got the ""new Android 14"" update, which feels 99.99% the same, and one of the new things is I can change the widgets on the lock screen. So I can finally remove the Google Home widget that I DO NOT USE and DO NOT NEED from my home screen, and replace it with the very handy mute switch that I will use a lot. However, it is very difficult to understand if I managed to active it or not, because the phone will give you feedback only if you didn't hold your finger long enough to active the switch. I ask why not give me the vibrating feedback when the phone is muted and a sound when it is not, which would mean I can use that widget almost without looking at my phone and make it useful. Otherwise, I need to get my phone in my hand press on the widget, and check what was activated, which is not much different from pressing the volume button and choosing the sound option from there.I understand that this might be a learning curve and I would probably get used to it, but it just feels unintuitive, and it was added for the sake of adding it to be like Apple. So I am curious if other people also think that Google from a leader and innovator is now playing catch-up to Apple."

"Positive","Made by Google 22 vs Apple's Launch Events.I just watched the made by google event which released their pixel products and introduced a lot of cool features. But the event is lacking the vibe, the excitement of the apple events. I think Google makes great software, build a lot of cool features with very advanced technology (AI and ML etc.) but the event is not even close to Apple's events. I feel like Apple event is selling you the lifestyle rather than the products. Google event is still very much focused on the product features. I am curious what you guys think about it.

"Positive","Has anyone switched their entire ecosystem from Apple to Google?.So I have a Macbook, ATV 4, and was planning on getting the watch (for free) and iPad and some homekit stuff. But I'm not really impressed by the latest iPhones. I have a 6S now and the 8 isn't that much of an upgrade for me. And the X is nice and all but $1000 for a phone just to use the same stagnant OS? Don't know about that...So i'm looking at the Google Pixel 2. But then I'll have to look at the Nvidia shield, and the Google home and so on and so forth. I want to hear your experience if anyone has done this. I can't see myself sticking with iOS for too much longer but switching an entire ecosystem kinda makes me nervous. Not on the technical aspect, but more so if I switch i'm gonna be stuck with it for a while and I'm gonna have to make it work whether I like it or not. I've had a Nexus 5 before and I loved it, but the more I used it the more I realized that the ecosystems are the selling point. Well, that and it broke and T-mobile wanted to give me a 6P instead.So any thoughts?"
"Positive","(Serious) Is Google building their own ecosystem?.They have their own brand of phones now. I'm pretty sure they have their own computers (is that what Chromebooks are?!). Are they trying to go for an ecosystem like Apple? Apps/programs like facetime that seamlessly sync from a computer to phone?I guess I really don't know what chromebooks are and Chrome OS?! I can't tell if it's more a tablet or operating system like Windows, but it'll sync with Android (in the vein or iOS)?Is Fuschia a new OS or something that they want to use in their ecosystem?Anyone have any insight in this subject?"

Apple users definitely pay a premium at different levels, from paying more for iphone to paying more for uber, but I think most apple users get that feeling of completeness and perfection in the ecosystem, which is why they stick to it and which is what steve jobs envisioned.

"Positive","Google ecosystem vs. Apple ecosystem.I know, this question has come up countless times, but I still haven't found a satisfying answer. I use the Google ecosystem for most of my stuff. I've got the Pixel 8, the Pixel Buds A-Series, a Windows PC and I'm going to buy the Pixel Watch 3 soon. But I just recently got myself a refurbished MacBook Air M1 after weeks of thinking Chromebook vs. MacBook. When using it, everything just feels perfect. The design, the OS, the hardware, everything. So maybe I should switch to Apple all together. On the other hand I really like Android and wouldn't use iOS if I can. So my question is, considering my needs below, what do you think?**Smartphone:** Just like I said I will definitely continue using Android and Pixels.**Desktop:** Both chromeOS and macOS speak to me, but I haven't found hardware as good as a MacBook yet, any recommendations?**Browser:** I like both Chrome and Safari, although I couldn't use Safari on my PC, so that's a bummer.**Word:** I use Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Is Apple Pages any good?**Cloud:** I use Google Drive but could switch to iCloud since both suit my needs.**AI:** I do not consider myself an AI-enthusiast, but having someone to answer complicated questions is nice. Has anyone tried Apple Intelligence and Gemini and can compare them?**Mail:** Both iCloud mail and Gmail would work.**Maps:** No specific needs, is one of them better?**Pay and Wallet:** I don't have any experiences with both options, same question as above.**Calendar:** I heard Google's better, but I really just have basic needs to organize my life at the bare minimum.**Notes:** I prefer Apple Notes.**Presentations:** Is Apple Keynote any good (again, just basic needs)?**Passwords:** I currently use Bitwarden, but want a more integrated option. Which of them is more secure and better integrated?And I do not care about my privacy or my data.  EDIT: A Chromebook is a laptop replacement. It can run Linux, Android and chromeOS aps and I wouldn't do anything that a Chromebook can't. It's funnily really just hardware limitations. And of course I can use Google services with a Mac or an iPhone, but that's not the point. I want a tightly integrated ecosystem where hardware and software talk to each other."
"Positive","your reaction switching to Apple's ecosystem (2022-2023).I'm a long time Google phone user and deeply engrained into Google services. I'm pretty much ready to pull the plug.Their customer support burned me over something simple and it destroyed my perception on the company. It all has to go. It's now time to ad block everything.Google Fi, Google One, YouTube Premium, Nest Aware Security, countless Google Home devices, Chromecasts, Nvidia Shield, Android TV, and on and on. For those of you that were deeply engrained and migrated out of all Google services recently to Apple and other non-google services:What was your biggest challenge?Your biggest eye opener?What is your remaining nagging issues or things you miss?What is your biggest regret switching to Apple?I know there are a few Pixel/Android features that I will 100% miss that are not available, I just want to learn more before jumping ship. The playing field has changed a lot over the last decade, so I'm interested in the perspective people who recently changed ecosystems."

"Positive","Vertical ecosystem .Why is Google so ""wishy/washy"" about it's efforts to produce a complete and well integrated hardware ecosystem? I would truthfully like to see an installer to convert any Windows or Linux desktop into a Google apps client (the whole personal office stack) , have my phone, earbuds, tablet all be Google and not have to lower my expectations for usability. The current pixel tablet is awesome as a home hub but not a great tablet, the Pixel Buds A are( IMHO )better then the Pros, the watch is still a disappointment, poor health monitoring and too much bloat. Beyond good health monitoring,It only needs to let me know who's calling, show text messages, calendar events and when carrying my phone and wearing my earbuds, let me accept calls. Above all, it's battery life is laughable in comparison to my wife's Fitbit. Either beat apple or quit like M$."
"Positive","Pixel 8 - Antenna Issues.Long time lurker - after about 15 years with Apple I made the switch to Android with a Pixel 8 in November 2023. I used everything Google except for my phone and was hoping the Pixel would work well with the whole ecosystem.I was plagued with poor reception issues from the start, am based in Sydney, Australia, and regularly couldn’t make/receive calls or access data. I raised multiple times with Vodafone thinking it was a network issue (also switched from Telstra) and they changed network settings, replaced SIM cards etc, then finally suggested it could be a phone hardware issue, so started raising bug reports. Months later after a bunch of bug reports sent, they’ve advised there is an issue and I’m eligible for a free replacement.However outside of the antenna issues, I’ve noticed ‘Hey Google’ is significantly worse than the experience I had with Siri, and I’m frustrated that I’ve effectively had half a phone for over a year (occasionally I used to hotspot colleagues phones in the office to work!) Gemini also hasn’t been rolled out to my phone it appears for some reason. Additionally the battery life has been poor (I suspect because of the reception issues), and I’ve had issues with the fingerprint scanner. My wife has also commented on how hot my phone gets compared to her iPhone.I’m considering selling the replacement and going back to Apple or potentially a different Android, but thought maybe it’s worth asking Google for some sort of compensation by upgrading me to the Pixel 9.Anyone had any experience with a similar situation or any advice on how best to proceed?"
"Positive","Amateur review .Hi, I decided to share my early review with you in case you're still not sure if you want to buy a Pixel or not.To start, I've been switching phones often, but for the past four years I was stuck with iPhone (I decided to drop it because of the ecosystem - I have a watch, iPad, Mac, etc., but upgrading anything means I have to choose Apple products only, which I started to hate recently).My previous Android phone was a OnePlus (7 Pro the last one). I decided to switch to Pixel because I had an old Nexus and I was a very happy owner.Back to business, I love the system on Android, I feel it's far better than iOS. Some game changers for me are: - Being able to archive emails from the notification level. - Being able to reply on the notification level. - Navigation! I can move back by swiping from any side of the screen.I love the new Pixel's build quality, they're beautiful pieces of tech!You might be asking, ""Hey, you like it so much, what happened?"" Let me explain further.I played with it for a couple of days and I'm on holiday where I can extensively test the camera. I took my old iPhone with me.I did some recordings and videos seem to be quite far away from iPhone's quality. They're not even close, it feels like videos are slowing down, frames are not on the same level. To be honest I expected it to be worse, but not to that extent.Today I decided to play with photos and compare them more. I was surprised how far apart these two devices are. It seems that Pixel lacks details and changes the colors to be unreal (skin is more red/orange). I will share some photos with you, you can decide on your own.I started to think about this more and I realized that: - It's easier to cover the speaker on Pixel. - The main top speaker for calls on high volume increases high tones so much that it hurts my ears. - Every time I take a photo I need to wait for a while for processing to be finished. - Sending multiple photos via WhatsApp hangs the app for a moment, there is no feedback if it's sending photos or not.I'm not even going to start about how Google treats buyers in Poland...I hope you find this helpful. In case of any questions let me know. I plan to test it for a couple more days until I get back home. After that I plan to return this device.I really wanted this phone so much.(By the way, apologies for any grammar issues, English is not my native language)."

"Positive","Trying to make an ecosystem switch from iPhone to Pixel.Hey Pixel fans,It’s been a few years since my last Pixel (and almost 2 since my last Android phone), but after today’s event it feels like the right time to jump back in. I currently have an iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 7, and some old AirPods. I want to do the complete conversion and get the Pixel 9 Pro (honestly might go with the Fold), Pixel Watch 3, and the new Pixel buds. What’s the most price effective way to go about doing so? I can trade in my iPhone for $720, plus get that $300 store credit (I have Google One for that extra 10% too). Which would work fantastic towards the Pixel Watch…but it seems I need to receive the phone first before my store credit applies? Also, it also looks like I can get $150 store credit for my Apple Watch as a trade in towards the Pixel Watch. I would use that for the Pixel Buds. Is this the best route for me? Is the Amazon or Best Buy deals better?I am locked to Verizon because of work if that matters.Edit: Apologies in advance if this is an annoying question you all have to deal with every year🙏"

"Positive","Pixel 9 vs iPhone 16.Hello everyone, I’m changing my phone and I was determined to get a pixel 9 . The thing is I changes job recently and my company provided me with AirPods Pro 2nd gen and a MacBook Pro.

Previously had a pixel 2 xl.I can get the pixel 9 + buds pro (1st gen I assume) for 150€ less than the iPhone 16.What’s your opinion on it?"
"Positive","Some insights for people looking to switch to Pixel from iPhone (Android vs iPhone).1. Take time to explore and customize your settings. The default options aren’t perfect—you’ll need to tweak things, but once you do, this phone becomes the most personalized device you’ve ever used.2. RCS with iOS 18 has finally bridged the messaging gap between iPhones and Android. No more SMS headaches—if my texts send as SMS, I just remind my friends to update their phones. Photos send in much higher quality, and typing status and read receipts are awesome additions.3. Use KDE Connect [https://kdeconnect.kde.org/](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) to sync your clipboard between your Mac and Pixel. You can wirelessly browse your phone’s files from your Mac and share items like AirDrop.4. Battery life took about a week to settle. It was good but not great at first—now, it’s excellent. You really notice the difference once it optimizes to your usage.5. Gemini is miles ahead of Siri and keeps getting better. Gemini Live (full voice control) is amazing while driving. Don’t forget to activate your free year of Gemini Advanced—it’s like having ChatGPT that can also control your phone, home automation, and everything around you.6. I was surprised at how many of my existing smart home products support Google Home. Almost 1/2 of my devices weren’t compatible with Apple, now most are.7. Get the 256GB version if you can. I got the 128GB because the 256GB had a longer wait time, but it’s filling up fast. The extra space is worth it.8. Android Auto has grown on me, and I now prefer it to CarPlay because it’s more customizable. The main menu can still be a bit laggy, but it's smooth everywhere else. Features like pinch-to-zoom on maps, support for notifications from lot more apps, and a more customizable interface make it feel more advanced.9. Apple Music works great in the Android ecosystem, and I’m keeping it. Lossless audio sounds fantastic, especially since Android supports high-res Bluetooth codecs that iPhones don’t. It’s a great experience overall.10. USB-C is pretty much everywhere now, especially since iPhones have adopted it too. It’s awesome having just one cable for everything—your phone, laptop, and more, especially when you’re traveling.11. The latest generation of Android Wear watches is excellent. Don’t bother with last-gen models; the improvements in performance, and battery life make a huge difference. No more lagfest on my Galaxy Watch 7.12. Photos on Pixel usually looks better, with vibrant colors that pop, although iPhones sometimes capture more realistic colors and better dynamic range. Videos, especially when switching between lenses, aren’t as smooth as iPhones but still hold up well.13. Video editing is bad on the Pixel 9 Pro, and I assume it's similar with other Android phones. I tried a bunch of apps, just use your computer.14. Most apps are now on par with or better than iOS. Apps like Robinhood, Kia Access, and ClickUp work even better on Android, though some, like X (Twitter), still lag behind.15. I switched back to Android after years with iOS (iPhone 14 Pro -> Pixel 9 Pro XL). I was an early Android fan from the MyTouch 3G days and even used to be active as a developer in the modding scene. I left because of the jankiness and unreliability, but things have changed. Google is marching ahead with AI while Apple’s dropped the ball. The “it just works” vibe is finally here on Android, and universal standards like USB-C, RCS, and broader compatibility are making everything click. This feels like a major turning point in the ecosystem wars."
"Positive","Pixel 6a vs Pixel 7 vs Pixel 7a.Hello everyone.I am currently having Redmi note 4 (around 5 years old) and would like to switch pixel.Since i am into photography I was having choices of brands and finalised apple and google.I eliminated apple coz I dont want to move to its ecosystem right now.So finally decided to go with google.I finalised 3 devices.1. 6a2. 73. 7aNow 6a its like a perfect midrange phone.I would like to get this but there comes launch of 7a which might happen in april-may.As per my research 7a will have new camera sensor but at the same time it will not be in the same 6a price range.Now i looked for pixel 7 during sale and i extended budget but later saw its camera shattering issue and backed up.Nobody wants to invest money into a phone which will have a probablity of breaking camera glass specially in case of flagship.So right now i am thinking of 6a and 7a only.I can wait for launch so there is no hurry.I would appreciate if someone can guide me on choosing the right device."
"Positive","I daily both an iPhone and 9PXL.As someone who's been dailying an iPhone will using the Nexus/Pixel line as a secondary phone, here are my thought with the new 9 Pro XL vs my daily iPhone 15PM- The haptics are AMAZING on the 9 PXL. Phenomenal. But that has always been one of Google's strong suits. The iPhone just never lived up to that and it's always been an annoyance for me. Especially when typing. - The feel of the 9 PXL is heavenly. It just drips with premium vibes. Honestly, coming from the 8 Pro, it's such a drastic and wonderful change. It's indescribable. You just have to get one. - The 9 PXL takes STUNNING photos. Some of the best I've seen. The editing features are numerous and really help to make it your own shot. With that being said, not having front facing cinematic video on the 9 PXL is just stupid. Not to mention, cinematic blur is NOT the strong suit for Google even with photos. Never has been. Their edge detection is hookie dooks at best. Also, it's hard to describe in words, but if you're zooming in while taking a picture or video, the viewfinder on ANY pixel device, is not near as smooth as the iPhone.- Facetime. Having this for chatting with friends and family makes it HARD to beat. It just works. Every single time. - Integration with the Apple ecosystem is just killer. Airdrop. Copy and paste between Apple devices. - Google got it right with RCS and making Android Messages the standard moving forward. I am on the iOS 18 beta and it works flawlessly. I truly believe that more people will switch even though the ""green bubble"" is a thing still. - Gemini integration is a VERY nice touch. I honestly think this is one of the biggest selling points of the device. When you're using it inside of the apps that support it, it's great. It'll get better over time I'm sure. The one hangup is that Assistant still runs all of the basic things. Come on Google! Get it together."
"Positive","one week in... and why One Plus has an edge.Posting this in case somehow it proves useful for someone.   So I have had my pixel 6 for one week now and have had a chance to do a side by side with my partner's One Plus 9. For context, was using a Pixel 3 before ( and PH1 before that and then iPhone prior when they were still kinda affordable) and wanted to upgrade since there are no more security updates. Apple's accessibility features for those with low vision, have been rendered useless in newest OS' due to resolutions that are too high making an iPhone almost unusable ( never mind the price).   The good (and why it is worth keeping for me): Pixel 6 has 5 years of security updates, and they are pushed out monthly - no one can really beat this except Apple right now. Never mind the mere 3 OS updatesAccessibility built into android seems to win right now, at least you can make text large enough to see for the most part - granted sometimes it means you can't see or press buttons for unoptimized apps, but anyways. The form factor is good, (not great though as a bit heavy), especially as compared to pixel 3. The camera seems more geared towards amazing wide angle shots. The price, from many carrier with contracts, is acceptable.&#x200B;Google if you read this, please consider: Bring back fingerprint sensors on the back - under display is cool, and convenient if phone is on desk i guess, but they need to work better, (and even under full sunlight where I have noticed greater challenge in reading properly). Definitely no face unlock, as in times of mask wearing that is useless. USBC to HDMI - boy was I bummed to discover today when I tried plugging it in directly to my TV this doesn't work. Apparently, I need a Chromecast and then it could... grrrrr. I get it, buy into the ecosystem, but still this is Android not Apple we are talking about -  the OnePlus can do this....Now the next things are also OnePlus related, and I'm sure other phones can do it too, but feel it bears mentioning as I was able to make a direct comparison with someone close to me who owns one:A better screen to body ratio: The OnePlus has a larger screen mostly due to a tinier bezel. Note, I am not looking for rounded edges that break easily (mocking Samsung and ""pro"" phones here). The OnePlus seems to have somehow nailed this. Sigh.The camera: In a photo comparison of not so ideal indoor lighting, I noticed the OnePlus did so much better, surprising actually. It seems the contrast and white balance of Pixel's engine just wasn't getting it (and I tried adjusting to no avail). Outdoor though, things look gorgeous. Not entirely sure why this is, but was a bit surprised. Maybe there is another app that can fix this, or future updates will help - but not sure about that.Battery charging: wow - so no charger in the box, not so great wattage supported, I mean - at least it lasts longer than my Pixel 3, but like I want more! seems like an oversight here. &#x200B;So there it is, maybe I should have called this a comparison of the Pixel 6 vs a OnePlus 9 - but it is really i guess some buyer's remorse as I had high hopes for this Pixel 6 phone, that I plan to hold for a number of years. Sadly, will likely need to upgrade sooner than I had thought, with nothing else really comparable in the security/accessibility front.EDIT: Few months in and one thing I also notice, not a fan of the pixel 6 speakers - can never seem to really ""hear"" anything, front facing on Pixel 3 were awesome."
"Positive","finally back to happiness 😊.Yesterday I decided to pay off my 1 year old iPhone 13 and sell it and got a Google pixel 7 pro in Snowwhite. I'm absolutely astonished by this phone. The size of the phone is perfect, the weight is on point and not too heavy on either end of the phone. The screen in QHD is beautiful and having that 120hz makes a world of difference vs the iPhone 13 I had. I was very caught up in the apple ecosystem and even got an apple watch 7 a month ago, goodby apple and hopefully goodbye forever. Location services were taking a shit, face id was taking a shit, the camera was trash trash. This is my first full day with the pixel on a full charge so I'm excited to get some battery life because my iphone died within 4 hours or less from 100% doing door dash and spark and even without them apps running it died damn near just as quick and got old quick having to plug in. I traded my pixel 4a 5g in for the iPhone 13 a year ago and I regretted every bit of it. Being in the apple ecosystem that long really sucked for me. Looking for suggestions on settings people may use, rips and tricks I do not know about. I'm here to stay pixel fam!!!"

Apple has so much customization like a programmable button on the side of the phone & Siri. Plus the same looking phone for the past 5 or so years with minimal upgrades. lol. I am just so sick of Apple being a status symbol, rather than a phone that does cool features and has new hardware advancements and people eat it up like its groundbreaking. I just don't get it.

"Positive","Pixel 9 pro known issues.Hi all, I am an owner of pixel 8 phone and the last two weeks I face the issue with the pink line. Because I bought the phone in Greece google won't fulfill the warranty so I managed to get a refund from Amazon. So now I am trying to decide what my next phone will be and I am between iPhone 16 pro and pixel 9 pro. I don't really want to change in IOS ecosystem, but I also want a phone which will last a long time. My question is for the already users of pixel 9 pro, have you face any known issues or bugs to your daily use. Should I consider give Google another chance?"

"Positive","Apple ecosystem user considering switching.My last several phones have been iPhones, currently using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. The Pixel 9 Pro is a beautiful phone and looks to have some really cool features. I feel like the changes in the last few iPhone phone releases have been pretty small iterations. My biggest problem is I’m deeply integrated in the Apple ecosystem. I use MacBooks for both personal and work, I have the AirPods Pro, Apple Watch Ultra, and iPad mini. Majority of my friends and family use iPhones too so I have concerns about losing things like airdrop, iMessage, and FaceTime, etc. Any other Apple users switch over and how have you dealt with these issues?"
"Positive","Pixel 8 - Antenna Issues.Long time lurker - after about 15 years with Apple I made the switch to Android with a Pixel 8 in November 2023. I used everything Google except for my phone and was hoping the Pixel would work well with the whole ecosystem.I was plagued with poor reception issues from the start, am based in Sydney, Australia, and regularly couldn’t make/receive calls or access data. I raised multiple times with Vodafone thinking it was a network issue (also switched from Telstra) and they changed network settings, replaced SIM cards etc, then finally suggested it could be a phone hardware issue, so started raising bug reports. Months later after a bunch of bug reports sent, they’ve advised there is an issue and I’m eligible for a free replacement.However outside of the antenna issues, I’ve noticed ‘Hey Google’ is significantly worse than the experience I had with Siri, and I’m frustrated that I’ve effectively had half a phone for over a year (occasionally I used to hotspot colleagues phones in the office to work!) Gemini also hasn’t been rolled out to my phone it appears for some reason. Additionally the battery life has been poor (I suspect because of the reception issues), and I’ve had issues with the fingerprint scanner. My wife has also commented on how hot my phone gets compared to her iPhone.I’m considering selling the replacement and going back to Apple or potentially a different Android, but thought maybe it’s worth asking Google for some sort of compensation by upgrading me to the Pixel 9.Anyone had any experience with a similar situation or any advice on how best to proceed?"

"Positive","Are there any good phone brands in 2024?.Since the iphone 16e launch today, that made apples already poor image look even worse. then i thought about it, are there even any good phone brands in 2024?Apples all over the place, the iphone 16 lineup is awful, the 16e they just announced is awful, apple intelligence is awful, and half the features dont even come to the older phones (like the 16e getting visual intelligence via action button, but not the 15 pros which have the same button). The base models still have 60hz, and the 120hz pro models are limited by ios to run at 80hz max. The only saving grace is that ipads, macs, and airpods are so good compared to the competition. Also if you are in the united states like me, have fun using anything but iphone. Having any android is basically begging to get made fun of.Samsung cant seem to get an update out for the life of them. It looks like oneui 7 isnt even coming out for the s24 series until may at the earliest. if you are on an s23 device then you can just forget it, oneui 7 probably isnt coming this year for you. Good hardware but the software is just okay. The camera still struggles to beat the iphones despite having much better hardware. The bloatware and having a samsung/google variant of each app is just plain stupid and annoying. Basaically all they do is try to copy apple now a daysPixels just seem like a rip offs overall. Anything a pixel can do, a samsung or any other android can do better. Not to mention the garbage specs on pixel devices while costing just as much as iphones and samsungs. Pixels ui is pretty mid aswell. The main upside is that you are prioritized by google and get all the updates first. lets not forget to mention the pixel fold which is easily the worst fold on the market. The rest of googles ecosystem is practically non existent. They have a tablet which is not good, chromebooks which are also bad, and pixel buds which i doubt anyone is using. pixel watch is good atleast from what ive heard.Oneplus seems like the most reliable out of them all. The specs are better than every other flagship from the main brands while being cheaper. The only issue is that the camera does not seem up to par, and the software is not as feature rich as oneui/ios. Also app optomization is worse than the 3 listed aboveChinese brands:I cannot speak for them as I live in the USA where they are banned. They seem pretty good, but like I said I cant really compare them lol."
"Positive","Which compact flagship to choose?.I'm using a Galaxy A40 rn and I'm generally happy with it, but the charging stops working randomly, so I'm looking for a new phone.I need a super reliable, compact phone with good battery life and a decent camera. After analyzing the market, I've narrowed it down to four options. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my needs.1. Samsung Galaxy S25Pros:- Best small form factor, super lightweight- Familiar UI, so I'll feel at home from the get-go- Well-balanced device with no major flawsCons:- after using Galaxy for 4 years, it's getting boring, and I’d like to try something new2. Google Pixel 9 ProPros:- very appealing clean OS - Packed with AI features I plan to use for work- stellar camera experience-  by far the cheapest option where I liveCons:- Uncomfortably heavy (like the iPhone 16 Pro)- Pixel’s notorious for poor heat management- Larger than the other options- Mixed battery life reviews3. Apple iPhone 16 ProPros:+ Best resale value over time (at least where I live)+ well optimized battery life+ camera that just works.+ probably the best heat managenent from the pack+ Always admired Apple and wanted to try oneCons:- as a lifelong Android user, I'm worried iOS would disrupt my productivity, making buying a new phone pointless since it's meant to be a work tool - quite heavy (like the Pixel)- Not interested in diving into Apple’s ecosystem, except for this phone (I’m a Linux user btw)4. Xiaomi 15Pros:+ Best battery life by far+ decent camera+ Compact and lightweight, smaller than the iPhone and Pixel+ Brand aligns with my values outside the prestige onesCons:- the OS is known to be bloated as hell, which is the last thing I want for my productivity- Likely poor long-term durability compared to others- chinese phones depreciate so fast that reselling doesn't make sense, forcing me to keep it until it diesOverall priorities:1. Battery life - Essential as I'm often on the go2. Reliability - I store important data and can't risk losing it if the phone breaks3. Compactness and weight - I just dislike big phones4. Good heat management - My Galaxies overheat during navigation or video calls, and I won’t buy another phone with this issueThings I don’t care about:1. Fast/wireless charging2. Speaker quality3. Fingerprint sensor (I don’t use it)4. Years of updates (I won’t keep the phone more than 4 years)I decided not to focus on camera and CPU specs, as all the listed phones perform well in these areas. The Pixel and Galaxy have an AI advantage, but it’s subjective.The S25 seemed like the best choice since it has everything. Then I considered the Pixel, praised for addressing overheating and battery issues. But if I’m buying a 200g phone, I might as well get the iPhone, which has the same virtues without Pixel’s flaws. Then there's Xiaomi, with great battery life and size, but the bloatware is nearly a dealbreaker.Please don't suggest the Vivo X200 Pro Mini (I'm not buying it from China) or OnePlus 13 (it's too big). Both are great, but not options for me.Lastly, there are many reviews online, but they focus mainly on performance and battery out of the box. For me, the more important factor is how the phones perform after 2-3 years of use."
"Positive","What's a solid iphone to get into the apple ecosystem?.Hello, I'm a student living in germany and looking to buy a decent and reliable (preferably) iphone to build an ecosystem. I also own a macbook air m1 (2020) and an ipad 9th gen (2021) which have offered a great value without having to be upgraded after every few years.Given that, I currently use an android, specifically the OnePlus Nord Ce 2 lite (2022), which has been a great performer for its sub 200€ price. Naturally wanting to upgrade, I feel it'd be great to do so while also having an entry into the apple ecosystem. My current budget is around 600€ and have gone through several options like a used 15 pro, used 16 (upwards of ~675€), new/used 15 (650/600€). I had been waiting for the SE4/16e but the pricing vs. value just doesn't make sense to me.The key areas in which I'm looking an upgrade are: 1) good cameras (not having to use gcam),2) a decent battery for non-intensive daily use (5-6h of SoT),3) atleast a few OS upgrades (haven't had the best experiences with androids like oneplus, asus, motorola etc.),4) a compact size and decent in-hand feel which won't be a fingerprint magnet (~6.1/6.2"")5) a smooth user experience (snapdragon 695 is definitely showing its age),6) usb-c (so the 14 pro doesn't really make sense).7) *Edit: good haptics (I've tried the pixel 9 and the haptics were great, don't know how it compares to apple though)I'm aware that features like an always-on display, higher charging speeds, 120hz, dedicated telephoto lens are going to be the trade-offs but are they a deal breaker for someone upgrading from a series of cheap/budget android phones? Even though I feel the galaxy S24 (~640€ for 256gb) is cheaper and overall superior in terms of how much functionality a phone (along with its os) can offer, but is it enough to offset the convenience that an ecosystem can bring?PS: I've never used/owned an iphone before."
"Positive","Why you SHOULDN'T compare iPhone to Android.Here's my biased view -1 -  why it shouldn't be android Vs iPhoneyou can't compare iOS to android. It's vastly different. It's like comparing peanut butter Vs jam.Some people only like peanut butter, others only jam & some people have them together.If you like & are comfortable on iOS then I always recommend for people to not change.2 - iPhone secret sauceiPhone doesn't sell you on ""the best hardware"". They focus their attention on their operating system, ease of use & the main application most people use their phones for today - camera.They are usually 3-4 years behind on other android manufacturers on hardware feature - No fast charge, no QI share charge, smaller batteries, camera isn't 200mp, lower ram, no USB external storage etc.BUT they don't need those hardware features to stand out. Their software is simply the easiest to use. Children grasp ot quickly as do non tech savvy boomers.Plus messenger.3 -  Variety of choice - AndroidIn the phone space, only Americans seem to think it's ""IPHONE VS SAMSUNG""Everywhere else in the world, the android phone market is segmented.Huawei was a real player pre ban Pixel exists & offers a unique Android experience - first to new features LG, Sony, Etc..Xioami & their sub brands are pushing hard in the mid range. Honor, VIVO, etc are all fighting for market share.Because of the insane competition, it's led to serious innovation.Return of the flip phones, 120W fast charging, the fold out phones, etc...These companies use the hardware innovation to distinguish themselves from the other android options.First to market doesn't always mean best. Apple don't need to be first, they wait for the technology to go through a few evolutions before introducing it.Also means they don't end up with exploding batteries (Samsung).4 - Familiarity is importantAdded from the comments - It's all about what people are used to. iPhone are popular in the US, so more older and younger folks use it, then they just buy more iPhones.If you have a Macbook, iCloud & apple accessories then I understand why you won't change.Interestingly, Samsung are trying the same strategy with their new watches. Some features are locked only if you have a Samsung phone. Which is exactly why I'll never buy a Samsung watch.5 - AffordabilityStop buying phones you can't afford just because you want to ""keep up"" with the cool kids.I buy my phones outright & will fix before I replace. On my second battery right now.Don't go into debt just because you want a ""slightly better"" phone for a year or 2.6 - MarketingThis is where iPhone really does destroy the competition. Their brand value, marketing & loyalty is unrivaled.Huawei almost managed to dethrone Samsung with their ""24 month replacement policy - no questions asked"". The Google ban pretty much destroyed that trajectory though.As someone who has tried multiple different Androids, the one area they really lack is in marketing.Oneplus is an INCREDIBLE phone but so few people know about it Xiaomi too. In the Western markets."
"Positive","Rant on iPhones.Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like ‘innovation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘best ever’, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don’t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us — this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should’ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their “security and privacy rule”! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn’t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn’t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it “saving the environment”? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung’s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new ‘move to iOS’ app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don’t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don’t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. "
"Positive","Longtime Samsung user – thinking of switching to iPhone in the future. For those who switched, what made you stay?.I've been using Samsung flagships exclusively for over 13 years and used to be pretty biased against other brands. But recently, I've started feeling a bit frustrated with Samsung’s direction focusing mainly on AI while treating their other flagships like budget models.I'm not planning to switch right now since I'm happy with my S23U, but I’m considering my options for the future. The main reason is through my job, I get a discount on Apple products and can redeem points for Apple Gift Cards, but I need to decide by the end of the year or lose them.What I'm Looking For:- Not interested in Chinese phones (just don’t like their UI/phone design).- I don’t game (mostly to save battery).- Used to love customization as a teenager, but now prefer a minimal setup.- Sometimes too many settings feel overwhelming—I just want a smooth experience.- Primary usage: Cameras, normal phone tasks, music, and social media.- I like the minimalism of iPhones, the accessories ecosystem, and their battery life.I live in the EU, so iMessage and FaceTime aren't really a big deal for me. Only some people around me use iPhones.I’d only stick to Samsung, switch to iPhone, or maybe consider a Pixel. I don’t care about having the absolute best specs (like Chinese phones have on paper), I just want a premium phone that feels polished. My friend kept switching between iPhones and Samsung until she finally decided to stick with iPhones because she prefers them.For those who used premium Android phones for a long time but switched to iPhone, what made you stay?(Not looking for answers from people who switched back to Android, I’ve already read a lot of those stories)."
"Positive","Breaking up with Apple .Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice on switching from iPhone to something new. I have an iPhone 13 that is having some major issues, and am getting fed up with paying for the brand and not the quality. I’ve only ever had IPhone, my dad swears by Samsung though. Some of the most important features to me include;-The camera has to be great. I take an ungodly amount of photos -Storage. I always run out of storage on iPhone way too fast and it causes my phone to literally shit a brick and not work. -Battery. My iphone dies so fast and I usually keep a charger with me because of it. -Size. I would be ok with a slightly bigger phone than I have now, but not much bigger. -Customization. I feel like with my iPhone now I can’t set things up the way I want them. IU has gotta be good. Any and all recommendations would be appreciated greatly! "
"Positive","iPhone 16 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro, or Galaxy S25? Reposting Now That the S25 Is Out.Hey everyone, sorry for the repost, but now that the Galaxy S25 is officially out, I wanted to reconsider my options with fresh eyes.I’m currently debating between:iPhone 16 Pro – Premium design, fluid ecosystem, long software support, but super expensive, and Apple Intelligence isn’t even available in Europe yet. iOS 18 looks solid, but I’d lose Android’s flexibility. Also, I’ve heard typing on iOS can be kind of annoying, which makes me hesitant since I type a lot.Pixel 9 Pro – Great camera and battery, but stock Android is just not it for me. I can’t handle Android stock as is—it’s too barebones and honestly kind of ugly. I’d 100% have to put Nova Launcher or something similar to make it feel decent.Galaxy S25 – Best price-to-value ratio, One UI is polished, and Gemini AI is integrated. Samsung is also offering double storage + earbuds for HALF the price of the iPhone if I preorder. My only hesitation is the design—I'm not a fan of the three vertically aligned cameras. (Should I wait for the S25 Edge ?)Right now, I’m using a Galaxy S9 from 2018, and it's finally starting to give up on me. So whatever I pick, I need it to last at least another 5+ years.I have no real preference—I just don’t want to regret staying with Samsung or switching to something new. The Pixel is tempting for the camera and battery, the iPhone 16 Pro looks and feels premium, and the S25 is just an insane deal right now.Hoping someone can help me decide before tomorrow, because Samsung’s preorder offer ends in 48 hours, hahaha. (Not saying I’m leaning toward it, but, well, you know how it is...)Thank you !!"

"Positive","iPhone 16 Pro vs Pixel 9 Pro (An Honest Discussion).**Opening Disclaimer:** I'm not looking for some all-out Android vs iOS warfare here. I picked this non-brand specific sub for some advice on an even playing field. Strong opinions are fine but please explain them openly, this is not a thread for arguments.**My question:**Now, I've generally had android since SmartPhones were a thing (with the exception of the iPhone 4, that was the only iPhone I ever owned). Over the last decade or two I've gone through OnePlus phones, then was on Samsung for a few generations, and I've been rocking Pixels since the 6 Pro.My main machine I use is a beasty self-built Windows 11 PC, but my laptop is a MBA and my tablet is an iPad Pro.Now for a lot of the last 2 decades, I've been staunchly team Android, and would never have considered an iPhone.However, more recently I've needed to start moving to systems which just work as smoothly and easily as possible, and I've had to care less about overall control and flexibility.There's a variety of things I use which are much better integrated with iOS than Android and with a lot of stuff going on at the moment, I feel slightly better moving some of my life away from an advertising agency.So currently I have a Pixel 9 Pro (and yes, I know it's brand new), but I'm considering selling and buying an iPhone 16 Pro. Now this would be a HUGE move, as it would mean I'd also have to sell my Pixel Watch 3 in exchange for an Apple Watch.Now I know even for people who have generally wanted to switch from Android to iOS or vice versa, a lot of the time, being so intrenched in the ecosystem is what makes the switch so hard, but the way I'm feeling right now, it's very much now or never.Now there are a few features or integrations that I rely on heavily so want to confirm that they'd still be an option for me if I did switch:* I use Google Tasks religiously. A big part of this is MANY times a day, I press a button on my Pixel watch to activate Google Assistant and just say ""remind me to do X in 2 hours"", or ""remind me X at 8am every Tuesday"". And it'll set those reminders that will be both added as tick boxes in Google tasks, and that will notify me with a reminder at the time and day I requested. Now I know it won't do this with Google Tasks specifically, but is this functionality all there with iOS and an apple watch? I'd also need these lists to be accessible from a Windows computer (even if via a browser).* I'm presuming there's some way of transferring all of my 'Authenticator' 2FA app links to whatever Apple's equivalent is?* Whilst I want to move a lot of my stuff away from Google if I can, I use Google Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail heavily. Depending on the migration and cost implications I'd maybe be tempted to move them, but that would be down the line and I wonder how well they integrate with iOS (in terms of general google Drive usage, and automatically uploading photos taken on an iPhone to Google Photos).* Circle to search. I know this itself isn't in iOS, but something that allows me to select text anywhere on the phone (even if it's in an image) and either translate it or search for it online.* My house has a lot of automations and much of that is controlled with Google Home via Google Nests, will I lose any functionality not having an Android phone?* Finally, whilst it's a bit hit or miss on Android anyway, does iOS with the newly released Apple Intelligence, have some sort of AI web page summary feature?I know this is a lot to take on board but really my question is, how would I find moving from Android on a Pixel 9 Pro, to iOS on an iPhone 16 Pro, and is there anything in particular I'd miss?"

However, I also use Mac, Apple Watch and AirTags so the ecosystem got me locked in, which I hate but it does indeed make life easier. I use phone just for fun, reading news, listening to music, phone calls, messaging, playing chess, social media, some internet banking and investing. All work I do on my Mac and Mirrorless camera.  Apple makes great, reliable products but I do find iPhones a bit boring after decades of using them plus the price which is justified I suppose. I’m self-made with no family and had to safe every penny my whole life to progress but don’t mind spending on things that last and work well. I work as a digital designer so all tech innovations are great to observe/experience for me. All in all.. I’m a bit excited about a change but hesitant, wondering if I’m just making my life more complicated out of boredom. Has someone been in a similar spot, switched from an iPhone to Pixel and what would be your feedback? Thank you for any insights :)"
"Positive","iPhone 14 vs Pixel 8.Hi everybody! I’ve had an iPhone 11 for the past five years, and I’m finally looking to upgrade. So after analysing my budget and what’s available at my price point, I can get either a new Pixel 8 or a refurbished (by apple) iPhone 14. I’ve always been interested in getting a pixel, but I’m worried about transitioning from the apple ecosystem. What would your suggestions be? I’m not a particular tech nerd, so I am interested by specs but they are not of the greatest concern. Any other suggestions in a similar price point would also be appreciated! Thank you so much for the advice in advance people!"
"Positive","Need some help on deciding which phone to buy (iPhone vs Samsung vs Pixel).Hey all,I've been a longtime Android user and possess now a Samsung A34, which I like, it's smooth for my usage. However, I've been planning on getting a new phone that's more premium, and one I can safetly spend my money and not worry about it getting laggy in the next 3-4 years, which is what has been hapenning with my previous smartphones.I've looked at iPhone 15 Pro (the 16 has just been announced too), the Pixel 8 or 9, the Samsung S24 Ultra but I'm always undecided because all fo them have positive things, so I could use some help and opinions regarding these brands.Basically my main priorities in a phone are (not necessarily in this order):* Good camera for videos (I want to record quality videos as I post guitar videos on youtube) and for photos also (normal usage like instagram posts, some concerts, etc)* Longevity (I do not want to worry about getting a new phone in the next years due to sudden slow applications and lack of memory)* Battery (I do not use my phone that much actually, the max I used my phone in the last 7 days was 3 hours, so it's usually less than that on average, so I do not want a phone that's gonna drain while I don't use it, and could hold decently while I watch some reels and tiktoks)Thanks in advance!  EDIT: I live in the EU, I know it impacts some things namely with Apple devices. I also have a work MacBook and heard wonders about it's sync and ecosystem, could be something that's handy for me too."
"Positive","Apple vs Google. In your opinion, does it makes sense to have an iPhone for the build quality, the operating system and the synchronization between devices, but then to use the Google ecosystem in its entirety (drive, photo, calendar, maps ...) because it is more complete and better structured than iOS system apps? Or would it make more sense to change directly to a Pixel phone, although in fact there are no Google PCs or laptops that allow a synchronization like Apple's? Thanks!"
"Positive","Apple vs Samsung Ecosystem.Hey all, I think I need a little help making a decision between these two ecosystems, I'll give you a rundown of my current thoughts and concernsI owned all of the Samsung Galaxy Phones from the S3 to the S8, as I was attracted to the customization and open-ness of it.However, every single samsung phone I owned ran into a plethora of issues very quickly within under 5 months, always being terrible battery life, overheating, and especially severe lagging. I also spent A LOT of time optimizing the phone. It was the same every time, despite everyone saying every year that it was going to be different this time and I'm still a bit scared of it. I was an immature high schooler though so I defended all of this while constantly declaring android superiority.I gave the google pixel a try after this and it was a much better experience, though apple's ecosystem had really started to interest me over time and eventually I got an iPhone. I was shocked by how fast everything was with no slow down even several months and I didn't have to charge my phone 2+ times a day. Frankly, it just worked, no optimization.I intend on investing in an ""ecosystem"" (MacBook, watch, etc) very soon because I really appreciate the simplicity and convenience of everything. I got an iPhone 11 recently (still within the return period).After being out of the loop about samsung for a few years I went and updated myself on what's been happening.  And it looks like samsung phones and its related products have improved a lot for that matter, with many people claiming that they no longer slow down as bad and no longer have battery issues like they did before. The display is also super beautiful and its way snappier than before. Even more important, there seems to be something of a decent ecosystem now with the watches and samsung notebook/books. I've been doing a lot of research and it really appealed to me.  Of course though I'm a little hesitant to trust people on the speed and battery issues as they said the same to me before though.If I did invest in the apple cosystem it would be an iPhone 11 and the related products (MacBook, watch, AirPods), I chose the especially for its battery life  and it being the perfect size for me. On the other hand, if it was samsung I'd probably go with the S20 (also a perfect size, though mixed reviews about the battery) along with a samsung laptop, watch and galaxy buds.The iPhone 11s battery has been great to me so far and I'm hoping for something similar in the s20 though research hasn't given me a totally clear answer. I think that good battery life and speed/smoothness (that stays that way for a long time) are the things I value the most.Sorry about this is being crazy long, I get a bit anal about these things so I try to get out all the details! I was wondering if anyone who's in the samsung ecosystem or has a lot of knowledge about it could help me out, thank you! :)"
"Positive","Google Pixel 4A 5G vs. iPhone SE.Hey everybody, I plan on buying the new Macbook Air with the M1 chip later this month. I have come to realize that the Apple ecosystem that would come with the Macbook and iPhone SE would benefit my workflow a good deal, especially with the pandemic going on as a college student. However, I also am aware the Google Pixel is a better phone in more aspects than the SE with specs alone. Do I make the tradeoff and get the ecosystem or go Pixel for the overall better specs (which would help my workflow too)?"
"Positive","My Tech Journey between Apple and Android and where to go next.Hey everyone,I've always been seen as an Apple fanboy by my friends, even though, for over a year, I barely had any Apple devices at home. Indeed, lately, I've been exploring Android phones, especially foldables, which have really caught my interest. I tried the S24 Ultra briefly but switched back to the Z Fold 6. Now, I have the Honor Magic V3, the first foldable that doesn't feel like a compromise in size. However, there are still some trade-offs, particularly in terms of software and photography. Then, I have started to wonder whether those trade offs are worth it and whether I would not be better off with a more ""dedicated"" slab device with a big screen. Indeed, I consume quite a bit of content on my phone, such as YT videos and I read a lot of PDFs, for which the Honor is great vs a regular slab phone; however, most of the time, I need to annotate or highlight the pdf which is not optimal. As to YT videos, the square format of the Magic V3 makes it that I don't think the video is actually much larger than it would be on an iPhone. Hence, I have the impression that most of the time I would be better served with a combo of the Ipad mini (for instance) and the iPhone. The counterpart is that I always have my phone with me and that would not be the case with the iPad mini.Anyway, the thing is, when the iPad Pro M4 came out and then the MacBook Pro M4, I made the plunge. Having an iPad and a MacBook Pro again has reignited my interest in Apple. Despite the Galaxy Watch 7 being quite decent, nothing beats the Apple Watch, and the Apple ecosystem remains unmatched in performance. I tried immersing myself in Samsung's ecosystem with a laptop, phone, tablet, and buds, but it just wasn't the same. In addition, I find that there are just more quality accessories for the iPhone than for any other phone and a lot of apps are usually better optimized on iPhones (maybe this is truer for tablets actually). There is also more content online for iPhones. For instance, I use an app called Notion and there are a lot of videos suggesting interesting shortcuts to speed up data entry, and this is just one exampleAs such, I'm considering the iPhone Pro 16 Max, but I'm hesitant because of the allure of regular Android innovations. Financially, it would probably be wise to change phones less frequently, and with iPhones, there's only one model a year anyhow, which limits temptation :-) Still, would I be able to wait close to a full year without wanting to try something new ? I know that if I go back to iphones, I cannot expect a lot of innovations over time and that this will mostly be incremental changes.Also, as I didn't get the iPhone 15, and my time with the iPhone 14 was brief, I realized it's been a while since I had an iPhone as my main device, and I have really come to enjoy some Android features like advanced notifications and multitasking. Losing these could be a downside. I'm also interested in AI, but what I really want is a personal assistant (that would simplify my day to day life), which still seems far off with any brand.I guess the wisest thing to do would be to wait for the S25 Ultra announcement to see what it offers.What are your thoughts? Have any of you faced a similar dilemma?\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*As an aside, if that may be of interest to anyone, I have trained Notebook LLM with about 30 sources (mostly reddit and youtube videos) to provide a summary of the pros and cons of the Iphone 16 PM and the S24U:**iPhone 16 Pro Max: Improvements, Strengths, and Weaknesses*** **Display:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 460 pixels per inch (ppi) and a peak brightness of 2000 nits. It offers a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio, resulting in thinner borders. However, the camera cutout on the display is a notable interruption. While the display is excellent, it does not have the anti-reflective properties of the Samsung S24 Ultra.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Bionic chip, built on a 3nm process, leading to better efficiency and performance. It has 8GB of RAM. In benchmarks, the A18 Pro chip shows significantly higher single and multi-core performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the S24 Ultra. In real-world usage, both phones feel equally snappy.* **Battery:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 5.5% larger battery than the previous model, with a capacity of around 4,568 mAh. It has improved battery efficiency due to optimized software and hardware. The battery life is generally considered very good, often lasting a full day with normal usage. It supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, but does not have reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging can be finicky, and may require an Apple charger. The charging speed is slower than the S24 Ultra.* **Camera:** The primary camera is 48 megapixels (MP), with a larger sensor and pixel size. The iPhone has excellent video recording capabilities. The iPhone uses a 12MP sensor for the Periscope zoom, while the S24 Ultra uses a 50MP sensor. The iPhone's ultrawide camera is 48 MP, while the S24 Ultra uses a 12 MP sensor. While the camera generally takes better photos, some note the Samsung's camera is superior in certain conditions such as low light. The new camera control button is described as ""pointless and gimmicky"" and ""flawed,"" with its accuracy being ""horrific"". The software is still in development for the button.* **Software:** The device has Apple Intelligence, which includes features like notification summaries, text proofreading, and the ability to summarize emails and notes. Siri has been enhanced with the ability to type to it. However, some of these features are not fully reliable. The device also offers iMovie, Garage Band, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. The predictive text on the keyboard works very well.* **Weaknesses:** The most significant weaknesses of the iPhone 16 Pro Max are its new camera control button, which is largely seen as a failed experiment, the fact that it runs hotter than other phones, and the thermal throttling where the performance takes a dive right after one minute of intense use. The lack of reverse wireless charging is also a minor disadvantage. The notes app on the Apple ecosystem is significantly better than what Android offers.**Design and Build:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max features a refined design, inheriting the style from previous models but with a more futuristic and elegant look. It has glass on the back and front, with stainless steel sides. The design is ergonomic and well-balanced. While some find the iPhone design to be stagnant, the 16 Pro Max introduces some changes to the exterior, making it feel fresh. The device is also durable with a ""Frosty glass"" back that hides damage, and the matte titanium sides do not show fingerprints easily. It maintains IP68 water and dust resistance.**Detailed Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs Samsung S24 Ultra*** **Display:** The S24 Ultra display is slightly smaller at 6.8 inches with 505 ppi, which makes it more pixel-dense than the iPhone’s display, and is also brighter at 2,500 nits. The S24 Ultra's screen-to-body ratio is lower at 88.5%. The S24 Ultra has a unique Corning Gorilla Armor glass that reduces reflections in direct sunlight, a feature not found on the iPhone.* **Performance:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max, with its A18 chip, generally outperforms the S24 Ultra in benchmarks. However, real-world performance is comparable. The S24 Ultra has 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB. The iPhone has better stability in stress tests compared to the S24 Ultra.* **Battery and Charging:** The S24 Ultra has a larger 5,000 mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 15W wireless charging, with reverse wireless charging at 4.5W. The S24 Ultra charges to 65% in 30 minutes, while the iPhone charges to 50% in 30 minutes. The Samsung charges faster overall. Despite having a smaller battery, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a slightly longer battery life during normal use.* **Cameras:** The S24 Ultra has a 200MP primary camera, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 48MP primary camera. The Samsung has a higher digital zoom capability, reaching 100x. While the Samsung has larger sensors on the Periscope zoom lens and the ultrawide lens, the iPhone utilizes larger pixels. The iPhone's photo and video quality is generally seen as slightly better. The Samsung has more camera options including 8K video, Director's View, and Expert RAW.* **Software:** The iPhone runs on iOS, while the S24 Ultra runs on Android. The user experience is a matter of preference, with iOS being known for stability and intuitiveness. Android has more flexibility and customization. Samsung has features like DeX, which allows for a PC-like experience. Both offer similar AI features such as photo editing, image generation, and text summarization. The iPhone uses chatGPT to answer questions and the S24 Ultra uses Bixby. The iPhone has a smoother autocorrect, but the Samsung has more AI tools built in. Samsung offers 7 years of software updates, while Apple offers at least 5.* **Design and Durability:** The S24 Ultra has a more angular design with titanium, and is heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The S24 Ultra has better screen protection, with the Corning Gorilla Armor glass.* **Unique Features:** The Samsung S24 Ultra has the S Pen stylus, wireless power share and can turn into a fully functional PC with Samsung Dex. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has the action button and the camera button. The iPhone also has emergency SOS.**Price:** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is priced at around £1,199/$1,199. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a higher launch price of £1,249/$1,299. The Samsung often has offers available, making the price more competitive. Android devices typically depreciate faster than iPhones.**Comparison: iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL*** **AI:** The Pixel phones are known for their strong AI implementation, which includes features like Gemini Live and impressive generative AI tools.* **Camera:** The Pixel phones are often praised for the camera quality.* **Software and User Experience:** The Pixel devices offer a different Android user experience than Samsung devices. They often use a ""pure"" Android, with less manufacturer customization. The Pixel devices have fewer pre-installed apps and bloatware compared to some other Android devices.**No Specific Details:** The provided sources do not contain detailed comparisons between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but some sources suggest that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has some advancements over the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly in software and AI capabilities. The video mentions that the Pixel often has better AI integration than both Samsung and Apple.**Apple Ecosystem vs. Android Ecosystem*** **Android Ecosystem:** The Android ecosystem is known for its flexibility, wide range of options, and customization. The ecosystem has a broad range of devices, including phones, watches, earbuds, tablets, laptops, TVs, and home appliances. Samsung and Google are the two main competitors, each providing comparable features to Apple. The Android ecosystem often offers more diverse hardware options, including foldable and flip phones. The ecosystem is often more open and allows for more options for third-party software. This open system can lead to some inconsistencies and fragmentation. The various manufacturers and their customizations may create confusion amongst users.* **AI:** Android has a clear advantage in AI capabilities and its implementations are further along than Apple’s. Apple's AI focus is on privacy and on-device processing. Android’s AI, from the likes of Google and Samsung, use more advanced server-based processing, with potential questions around privacy.* **Business Models:** Apple's business model focuses on selling hardware and services, keeping users within their ecosystem. Google’s Android business model is based around advertising; the company aims to collect user information in order to better target advertisements. Samsung aims to sell products and technology to both users and to other manufacturers.**Apple Ecosystem:** Apple's ecosystem is known for its seamless integration across devices. It provides a consistent user experience and ease of use. Apple controls both hardware and software, which allows for better optimization and integration. Key features include AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, and the ability to use an iPad as a second screen for a Mac. The ecosystem includes the iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook. The ecosystem provides a reliable and stable experience with minimal crashes or slowdowns. The ecosystem’s tight control over its products and software can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage; while it promotes a seamless experience it also reduces the amount of customization available to users.**Conclusion** The choice between the iPhone 16 Pro Max and its Android competitors depends heavily on individual priorities. If a user values simplicity, stability, and seamless ecosystem integration, the iPhone may be the best option. If a user prioritizes customization, flexibility, a wide variety of options, or AI integration, an Android device might be more suitable. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has improved battery life, maintains top-notch photo and video quality, and offers excellent ecosystem integration. However, it faces strong competition from Android models that offer innovation and better performance in certain areas. The advancements in AI technology are becoming increasingly more relevant, and this could lead to a major shift in the years to come."

"Positive","What's a solid iphone to get into the apple ecosystem?.Hello, I'm a student living in germany and looking to buy a decent and reliable (preferably) iphone to build an ecosystem. I also own a macbook air m1 (2020) and an ipad 9th gen (2021) which have offered a great value without having to be upgraded after every few years.Given that, I currently use an android, specifically the OnePlus Nord Ce 2 lite (2022), which has been a great performer for its sub 200€ price. Naturally wanting to upgrade, I feel it'd be great to do so while also having an entry into the apple ecosystem. My current budget is around 600€ and have gone through several options like a used 15 pro, used 16 (upwards of ~675€), new/used 15 (650/600€). I had been waiting for the SE4/16e but the pricing vs. value just doesn't make sense to me.The key areas in which I'm looking an upgrade are: 1) good cameras (not having to use gcam),2) a decent battery for non-intensive daily use (5-6h of SoT),3) atleast a few OS upgrades (haven't had the best experiences with androids like oneplus, asus, motorola etc.),4) a compact size and decent in-hand feel which won't be a fingerprint magnet (~6.1/6.2"")5) a smooth user experience (snapdragon 695 is definitely showing its age),6) usb-c (so the 14 pro doesn't really make sense).7) *Edit: good haptics (I've tried the pixel 9 and the haptics were great, don't know how it compares to apple though)I'm aware that features like an always-on display, higher charging speeds, 120hz, dedicated telephoto lens are going to be the trade-offs but are they a deal breaker for someone upgrading from a series of cheap/budget android phones? Even though I feel the galaxy S24 (~640€ for 256gb) is cheaper and overall superior in terms of how much functionality a phone (along with its os) can offer, but is it enough to offset the convenience that an ecosystem can bring?PS: I've never used/owned an iphone before."
"Positive","iPhone 16 base vs Samsung galaxy s25 apple ecosystem..Hey folks, I’m in the market for a new phone and my s21 is on the brink of death (battery expanding in the phone, lasts 2 minutes off charge)I’m currently using my partners old iPhone and I’ve enjoyed the ecosystem functions like copy paste clipboard and air drop etc. A lot of people have said considering the better refresh rate, snapdragon and ram of the s25 it’s a no brainer.I mainly use my phone for hiking/running navigation, doom scrolling, photos, and watching media/videos. No gaming whatsoever. So high performance may not be necessary 🤷‍♂️I mainly want a phone which will take good photos and not die while navigating, and last me 3-4+ years. I’m a student so this would be a huge investment as money is pretty tight.At the moment the price is pretty equal in Australia.Keen to hear people’s thoughts. Or if you have alternative phone suggestions that will last and slightly hold value/ easily repairable. EDIT : I use my phone a lot for work. Sensitive info & Microsoft office, security is important I’d also prefer a regular size phone as they fit better in my running belts and hydration vestsUpdate: ended up getting the S25 and I'm stoked with the choice. There's some things I miss about the iPhone I used temporarily. But hardly. The s25 is a beast... At least comparing what I'm used to. Battery life is great, lasts me a whole day using regularly, maybe even a day and a half if I'm at work. I Used all trails running for 2.5 hours would have only dropped 15% battery.  I downloaded wuthering waves and I'm not a phone gamer at all, but the phone holds up and plays really well. I definitely prefer the OS and settings of android. Only thing I don't like, is it doesn't feel like it's that special of a phone in your hand, looks wise. Cameras are really good, not mind blowing though. "
"Positive","Stock Apple vs. Samsung vs. Pixel apps, how do they compare?.I'm really only familiar with iOS stock apps, but I do use some Google web apps on PC. Are there any clear winners and losers in comparing them? I know one big downside with the Samsung ones is that they aren't available via the web, however Samsung does let you access them all via Windows apps. "
"Positive","Request for Your Support in Highlighting a Security Issue in Google's Pixel Phones
.I am reaching out to request your help in bringing attention to two important security features that Google should implement in its Pixel line of phones:1. **Require a PIN to power off the phone or access the power menu from the lock screen.**2. **Require a PIN or fingerprint to access quick toggles from the lock screen.**I recently bought a used Pixel 6a for its camera and software, but unfortunately, it was stolen while I was on a bus. The thief initially answered my call, but then turned the phone off, making it impossible to track. The phone had an eSIM, which cannot be removed unless the device is unlocked, yet the thief could easily power it down from the lock screen. If these features had been implemented, there would have been a higher chance of recovering my phone.While Google is introducing offline finding features, they currently do not match the effectiveness of Apple’s solutions. These theft prevention measures lose their impact if a thief can simply power off the phone.Other brands like Samsung, Motorola, and OnePlus already have such security options, which, when combined with an eSIM, make the phones much harder to steal. While some may argue that these features won’t entirely prevent theft, they would greatly increase the chances of catching the culprits.The Indian government's website for reporting stolen phones is a step in the right direction, but it’s ineffective if the phone is turned off, shipped abroad, and sold. Though some third-party apps offer similar protection features , their reliability and security are questionable.As active google phone users, your support in raising awareness on this issue could push Google to prioritize these simple yet crucial features, which would greatly improve security for Pixel users.Thank you for considering this request."
"Positive","Why you SHOULDN'T compare iPhone to Android.Here's my biased view -1 -  why it shouldn't be android Vs iPhoneyou can't compare iOS to android. It's vastly different. It's like comparing peanut butter Vs jam.Some people only like peanut butter, others only jam & some people have them together.If you like & are comfortable on iOS then I always recommend for people to not change.2 - iPhone secret sauceiPhone doesn't sell you on ""the best hardware"". They focus their attention on their operating system, ease of use & the main application most people use their phones for today - camera.They are usually 3-4 years behind on other android manufacturers on hardware feature - No fast charge, no QI share charge, smaller batteries, camera isn't 200mp, lower ram, no USB external storage etc.BUT they don't need those hardware features to stand out. Their software is simply the easiest to use. Children grasp ot quickly as do non tech savvy boomers.Plus messenger.3 -  Variety of choice - AndroidIn the phone space, only Americans seem to think it's ""IPHONE VS SAMSUNG""Everywhere else in the world, the android phone market is segmented.Huawei was a real player pre ban Pixel exists & offers a unique Android experience - first to new features LG, Sony, Etc..Xioami & their sub brands are pushing hard in the mid range. Honor, VIVO, etc are all fighting for market share.Because of the insane competition, it's led to serious innovation.Return of the flip phones, 120W fast charging, the fold out phones, etc...These companies use the hardware innovation to distinguish themselves from the other android options.First to market doesn't always mean best. Apple don't need to be first, they wait for the technology to go through a few evolutions before introducing it.Also means they don't end up with exploding batteries (Samsung).4 - Familiarity is importantAdded from the comments - It's all about what people are used to. iPhone are popular in the US, so more older and younger folks use it, then they just buy more iPhones.If you have a Macbook, iCloud & apple accessories then I understand why you won't change.Interestingly, Samsung are trying the same strategy with their new watches. Some features are locked only if you have a Samsung phone. Which is exactly why I'll never buy a Samsung watch.5 - AffordabilityStop buying phones you can't afford just because you want to ""keep up"" with the cool kids.I buy my phones outright & will fix before I replace. On my second battery right now.Don't go into debt just because you want a ""slightly better"" phone for a year or 2.6 - MarketingThis is where iPhone really does destroy the competition. Their brand value, marketing & loyalty is unrivaled.Huawei almost managed to dethrone Samsung with their ""24 month replacement policy - no questions asked"". The Google ban pretty much destroyed that trajectory though.As someone who has tried multiple different Androids, the one area they really lack is in marketing.Oneplus is an INCREDIBLE phone but so few people know about it Xiaomi too. In the Western markets."
"Positive","Rant on iPhones.Long post. Apple is so rigid with their products and services. They need to relax a bit and give users more freedom to use features. Recently, got an iPhone 16 pro and I am disappointed. There are hardly any improvements. Apple is so smart with adding words like ‘innovation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘best ever’, etc with their products that hardly anything matches with what they are claiming. A simple icon for location services is not available to be added on the control centre. Whatsoever maybe the reason. On Android, it takes a second to turn on location, whereas on iPhones it is a multiple step process. Why?What is the point of customisation and widgets if you cannot choose the features? NFC cannot be turned on unless using the Shortcuts app, multiple process again. It should be a tiny icon or widget on the control centre. The customisation and widgets are gimmicky. Half of them don’t work. Tapping the WIFI or bluetooth icon should turn it on/off but instead it just pauses and automatically turns on later. Why? Off means off, on means on. No separate option for vibrate, silent or ring mode. Those haptics thing is confusing. The action button is useless. And so is the, camera control button. The cameras are amazing but only sometimes. No manual mode option or night photography option available. The current camera features sucks! Low light is bad, HDR is way too much. Again, stubborn with their features telling us — this is what we will give, deal with it.Come on now, mid range android phones are taking great pictures. Whereas, the iPhone 16 pro cannot even focus on the moon! Disappointed by the camera! Hope they fix it in the next update. Basic features and settings are being taken away and we are forced to use with whatever is left. No fingerprint scanner, no notification history, no gaming mode, no back button (gesture sucks), etc these are the things which should’ve been given as an option and the user can choose whatever they want but instead they take it away and enforce their “security and privacy rule”! No doubt, these iPhones are great devices, the optimisation, etc everything is great but please stop taking away the most basic things. They got customisation options in the new phones whereas android has been doing it for years. The notch was fine but the dynamic island is an eyesore! Under display cameras are great on other devices. No physical sim option. (Limited to US but they might make it for every country soon)Siri is so outdated and so bad. Google has done an amazing job with the AI assistant, it is so simple and effective, it is available in regional languages, can quickly do things. Whereas, Siri is stuck in 2015 doing the same old tasks, doesn’t even support regional languages, gets stuck, doesn’t even understand the accents or questions properly many times. Refresh rate is low. I have noticed it many times, it stutters a lot when using. Imagine spending thousands and not even giving high refresh rate, mid range devices are smooth as butter on Android. Again, the most basic feature has been restricted. Now, people will say that iPhones are smooth and it adapts the way use and that is how refresh rate works or blah blah. Stop restricting. I have used a few Android devices, including mid range and high range phones, and they are amazingly good. Charging us more and separately for accessories? Who even came up with stuff like this? And then, calling it “saving the environment”? Peak capitalism! They were so rigid with not even changing the charging port to USB-C, all thanks to EU, who made it all happen. And even with the change, it charges slow! I mean, why would I buy apple chargers when I can charge it with a Pixel or Samsung’s chargers? Yet another sly move here. What is the point of technology if it cannot connect to other devices? Or make lives easier? We are in 2025, and sharing data between iOS and Android is still a headache! The new ‘move to iOS’ app is terrible. It lets you transfer data only during the setting up process, only after factory resetting the iPhone! This should have been an easy task but no. Apple should have made this data sharing easy, an app which can let you transfer data anytime, any data. Why force to factory reset every time? Why should we rely on third party apps? Android phones have this so easy. File management sucks. Cannot even transfer data from a laptop to an iPhone. Why force us to use iTunes? Who even uses it anymore? iTunes is so terrible! Just a simple copy paste should do! 5GB of cloud storage? Stop fooling around!They got rid of 3.5mm headphone jack, which was unnecessary. Cannot connect to many smart TVs! We don’t want aluminium or titanium, glass or plastic will do but make sure you have the basic features a phone needs to have. And yes, Android is way ahead of iOS. People are stuck in the ecosystem or whatever. Otherwise, iPhones would have gone the Blackberry or Nokia route. The brand perception, genius marketing is keeping them in the business. And not the expensive products. And Apple still has the audacity to slow down older iPhones with every single update. Calling themselves the geniuses and fooling people with clever marketing and wordplay. Many other things needs to fixed. These were some on the top of my head, might add a few later. Before you come at me, telling me to switch to Android, don’t. I have an Android device and an iPhone. And both are good and bad in their ways. Just wanted to point out some things about the most overhyped, overpriced product that is, iPhones. "
"Positive","Longtime Samsung user – thinking of switching to iPhone in the future. For those who switched, what made you stay?.I've been using Samsung flagships exclusively for over 13 years and used to be pretty biased against other brands. But recently, I've started feeling a bit frustrated with Samsung’s direction focusing mainly on AI while treating their other flagships like budget models.I'm not planning to switch right now since I'm happy with my S23U, but I’m considering my options for the future. The main reason is through my job, I get a discount on Apple products and can redeem points for Apple Gift Cards, but I need to decide by the end of the year or lose them.What I'm Looking For:- Not interested in Chinese phones (just don’t like their UI/phone design).- I don’t game (mostly to save battery).- Used to love customization as a teenager, but now prefer a minimal setup.- Sometimes too many settings feel overwhelming—I just want a smooth experience.- Primary usage: Cameras, normal phone tasks, music, and social media.- I like the minimalism of iPhones, the accessories ecosystem, and their battery life.I live in the EU, so iMessage and FaceTime aren't really a big deal for me. Only some people around me use iPhones.I’d only stick to Samsung, switch to iPhone, or maybe consider a Pixel. I don’t care about having the absolute best specs (like Chinese phones have on paper), I just want a premium phone that feels polished. My friend kept switching between iPhones and Samsung until she finally decided to stick with iPhones because she prefers them.For those who used premium Android phones for a long time but switched to iPhone, what made you stay?(Not looking for answers from people who switched back to Android, I’ve already read a lot of those stories)."
"Positive","Breaking up with Apple .Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice on switching from iPhone to something new. I have an iPhone 13 that is having some major issues, and am getting fed up with paying for the brand and not the quality. I’ve only ever had IPhone, my dad swears by Samsung though. Some of the most important features to me include;-The camera has to be great. I take an ungodly amount of photos -Storage. I always run out of storage on iPhone way too fast and it causes my phone to literally shit a brick and not work. -Battery. My iphone dies so fast and I usually keep a charger with me because of it. -Size. I would be ok with a slightly bigger phone than I have now, but not much bigger. -Customization. I feel like with my iPhone now I can’t set things up the way I want them. IU has gotta be good. Any and all recommendations would be appreciated greatly! "
"Positive","S23 Review for choosy users.# The Samsung S23 nearly gets lots of things right.Me again to tell you the things about devices that professional reviewers won’t. I recently reviewed my [Zenfone 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/xic1o1/zenfone_9_critique_the_good_the_bad_and_the_very/), [Samsung S22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/tsltye/warning_the_s22_is_has_terrible_battery_life_and/) and [Xiaomi 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/coomments/11t0qyh/xiaomi_13_review_for_pedantic_jerks/). Now I’m here to tell you what will annoy you about the Samsung S23.bDisclaimer: as ever, I’m being picky. I have a professional digital-design background, and I am particularly sensitive to UI / UX, so will be critiquing it heavily. If you don’t care abocut polish or attention to detail, this review isn’t for you. If you're all about manually tweakable features over appearance, these thigns may not annoy you. If you’re a die-hard Samsung fan, you won’t like this either so it's probably best to stop reading.And no, my device, along with the previous 10 devices I’ve owned, is not faulty. Nobody is that unlucky. I am just attentive to small details. If you didn’t notice these issues, great. Enjoy your device. But they exist.## The BadI’ll start with what you came for: what’s going to bug you if you’re a details-focused user.## CameraThe camera is actually ~~better~~ less blurry than expected, but I'm still listing it as bad overall. I mostly take photos of moving things (friends, kids, pets, sports) and most phones suck at this. The Pixel and iPhone are excellent, and the Xiaomi 13 was damned close. The [Zenfone 9 was beyond abysmal](https://imgur.com/a/btSApvS). The Samsung is… [OK](https://imgur.com/a/KKZEjBq). Like, I don’t worry I’m going to miss a moment, as I did with Asus, but it’s definitely less consistent than the top tier.Where it sucks is colour. I’m colourblind (which means I don’t see some colours as strongly), so I generally like slightly over-saturated colours that make it easier for me to tell what colour things are. However, this is just too much, even for me. Colours are way, way too saturated. For example, [grass looks acid green](https://i.imgur.com/n4iafvP.jpeg) and just wrong. Photos come out looking like [Telly-tubby land compared to an iPhone or Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/yIBkKaG.jpg), and I can’t work out where to tone this down. I just want the point-and-shoot photos/videos/portrait results to be normal, and they aren’t. I guess some people must like this, but I find it disgusting.Every other manufacturer lets you tone down the vibrancy of colours in the camera, but not Samsung. As with everything in OneUI, you can change 1000 things, but can't change the parts that matter for a good experience.You can use Pro Mode, but then you lose HDR and so lose detail in the dark and bright spots of your photos (and it's already worse at this than Pixel / iPhone). Plus, I shouldn’t have to - the phone should work for me, not vice-versa. You can use Expert Raw mode, but this cranks the saturation even crazier.I tried installing GCam, but current ports have tonnes of stability issues and I don't want to miss moments. For example, some modes don’t work at all and will just crash the camera. Also, having to remember which camera you open for each scenario is tiring and tine consuming. I just want it to quickly launch and take a good photo.After a week, I hate what this does to colours so much that I may well return the device. My phone is my only camera, and this one is poor.## OK Google stops workingI’m not an idiot, so I use Google Assistant instead of Bixby. My issue is that ‘OK Google’ detection stops working throughout the day. Usually, if I haven’t used Assistant for an hour, it simply won’t pick up ‘OK Google’ when I come to it and most of the time you're just left looking like an idiot having a one-way conversation with a beligerent object. I’ve tried clearing cache, re-installing, turning off all kinds of battery efficiency options etc. Basically, I just can’t rely on it working, which is super annoying for me as I use it a lot. A hands'free assisttant that requires hands is pretty pointless.**UPDATE: A week later, this has magically fixed itself (but see limitations under bluetooth, below).**## Bluetooth and Pixel Buds Pro woesI have continuous issues with bluetooth devices and this handset, which I haven’t experienced with and of my other handsets (Windows, iPhone, Pixel, Xiaomi, Zenfone). *Usually*, music will play fine, but calls intermittently only come through one bud, or the recipient will complain they can’t hear me clearly. They’ll randomly transfer the call back to the phone in my pocket half way through calls.Another issue I face is with the multipoint. Bluetooth devices will show as ‘connected’ in my Bluetooth settings, but audio simply won’t play (through them or the speaker) and will just revert to a ‘paused’ state. This seems to be when the buds are connected to another device simultaneously with my S23 via multipoint. None of the other devices seem to care, but the S23 hates sharing. I’ve had to turn it off.**UPDATE:  I've found Reddit posts from years ago re: Samsung phones and Pixel Buds, so this seems to be a long-standing issue with Pixel Buds and Samsung handsets exclusively. If you turn off 'OK Google' detection on the buds, calls will come through both buds. I haven't experienced this with any other OEM paired with my Pixel Buds. It is hard to say whether this is a Google issue or a Samsung issue, but I can confidently say that there isn't an issue with the same buds when used with Google, Asus, Xiaomi or Apple handsets.****If you want to lisen to music on your Pixxel Buds with an S23, you need to disable multipoint in the Buds settings. Bummer.**Frequently, the phone won’t auto-connect to my car stereo. I have to connect it manually. I’ve had the same car for 10 years, across probably 12 phones, and this is unique to the S23.It will connect to my wife's car stereo (2016 Skoda) for calls, but won't play music audio. It just keeps toggling that setting off.**UPDATE: When I called Samsung's support, their advice was that it's Skoda's fault and to change my car to a more modern one if I want to use a Samsung phone reliably. If you have a car more than 3 years old, don't buy a Samsung phone as they don't bother with backwards compatibility in their Bluetooth stack. However, I finally figured out a workaround myself. After connecting the Samsung S23 to a Skoda (Volkswagen) car stereo, you'll get a popup on the phone asking it to share contacts.** **Do not allow this! Or you'll have to forget the connection on both devices and re-pair next time you get in your car.** **I am having flashbacks to my Galaxy S2 (yep, that long ago) and remember it did the same thing in my old Honda at the time, in 2011, which is what prompted me to try this. How on earth has this been unadressed by Samsung for 12 years?** Overall, it’s like Bluetooth from the days before it worked properly, and I hate it. I don't like having to turn off the premium features of my Pixel Buds Pro exclusively for Samsung.## Call issuesIt drops calls sometimes, or the line is bad more than other devices. I don’t know if this is unique to my area or carrier or something like that, but I have dropped more calls in my two weeks with this device than in the last year combined. It also seems to struggle to hold onto carrier signal in my home office, where I have weak signal, but have never had an issue making calls with other handsets on the same carrier. And that’s coming from the Pixel 6 and 7: two devices known for having crappy radios. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is just another annoyance.**EDIT - OK I now realise the problem. This device can two sim cards. If I place my sim in slot 1, it intermittently drops signal every 10 minutes for about 30 seconds. The same sim is fine in the other 3 or 4 handsets I've tried it in, so I guess this is either a hardware issue, or a compatibility issue between Samsung and my EE micro sim.**## BugsIn my experience, Samsung software rarely works smoothly, and this phone’s experience  is no exception. It’s *always* up to something weird and there is a general lack of polish to the experience. This isn’t a comprehensive list, but here are a couple that I frequently experience:· The status bar frequently shows no data even when there is some. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/JP2OPL1.jpg) you can see me running an internet speed test over data whilst the device is informing me that there’s no internet connectivity. This is a regular occurrence. You may as well ignore the network indicators with this device.· After the system switches between Dark Mode and Regular Mode, Apps get stuck in some kind of strange [half-dark-mode](https://i.imgur.com/GWsjLGt.jpg) state where the UI will show half dark and half regular. Often it'll be black text on a black background, meaning you can't read notifications on screen. I’ve never seen this before on other devices.· Integrations generally don’t work well. For example, trying to add my Philips Hue to SmartThings just results in an [error](https://i.imgur.com/xgEvT8J.jpg). I don’t use Samsung services much, but this is pretty typical of my experience when I do – some aspect of the configuration phase won’t work properly. To be honest, this was the first integration I tried with Smart Things on this device, and it just reminded me why I avoid Samsung's software when possible.· You’ll frequently get a message on your lockscreen telling you that your face didn’t match, next to the unlocked symbol, which only shows because it matched your face. It’s just bad UI.· You turn off hardware keyboard notifications, but they still show.I could go on and on; the whole experience just feels very… untested.## Samsung doesn’t do usability – this is why people think Android requires you to be a geek.Basically, it feels like you’re working for your phone instead of it working for you. The other devices I used this year (Apple, Google, Xiaomi, Asus) learn your routine and do clever, quality-of-life things automatically. You don’t really need to think about it – they’ll just save you time by learning your routine, and you can always turn that stuff off if you don’t like it.Samsung offers a tonne of features that I don’t need, but continues to miss the mark on the basics. I can often find ways around these limitations using Good Lock, Samsung’s ‘Modes and Routines’ app, Macrodroid etc, but it’s very manual and imperfect. It feels like the relationship is backwards – my phone should make my life easier, but it feels like I’m working for my phone instead of it working for me.Some examples:* There’s no adaptive charging. My Pixel (and all other devices) would not charge to 100% until just before my alarm went off each day, so as to prolong the battery health. There’s nothing like this on Samsung. I managed to create something similar using modes and routines, but it’s horrible and requires a lot of manual intervention if you don’t wake up at consistent times (eg. You have kids or work hybrid and sometimes commute).* There is no ‘Sleep Mode’ as it exists on other devices – ie. where your device goes to Do Not Disturb only when plugged into power AND after a certain time in the evening. I had to make this myself for this device.* There’s also no ‘auto end DND mode when alarm goes off’. Again, I had to make this myself and it just isn’t as good as native integration.I seem to spend a lot more time turning things off-and-on than I ever did, and I’m always worried that I’ll forget to change something and my alarms won’t go off, or my ringer will silence itself in the day etc. After years of Pixel, I’ve just got used to not having to think about this stuff and it feels like a huge step backwards.Trying to add your Samsung account for the first time in a while will ask you to input the IMEI of a device that you haven’t owned for years. Mine wanted my Galaxy Watch 2’s IMEI, which I haven’t owned in like 3 years. This adds a 2 day delay on to using your phone whilst Samsung’s janky customer support goes through authentication. Nobody at Samsung has thought about how this shit experience affects the first-impressions of setting up the device.## Samsung still needs to hire UI designersI’ve discussed this [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nbv0mw/pixel_users_things_youll_hate_about_oneui/), and I know I’m going to trigger Samsung evangelists with this one, but Samsung’s UI is still the worst of the lot. I’m not talking the subjective parts of design that I *personally* don’t like. I mean, things are just not designed using graphic design **best-practice**.Polarising Fisher-Price squircle icons don’t match the rest of the design language – and the UI can’t decide if it’s circular or squircular as there are [both scattered throughout](https://i.imgur.com/1ZktDOS.jpg), often in the same menus. It’s such an odd choice to go with non-geometric shapes in a UI as they’re obviously polarising.Overly-rounded corner-radius is not appropriate for such a small screen and causes Samsung to break their padding consistency to fit content in.Iconography can’t decide if it’s linear or solid.Mis-matching of the user's font and some other narrower font that you can’t change in random places in the UI.Inconsistent sizing of notifications, where they're completely [different widths](https://i.imgur.com/wDU3gvM.jpg) (neither designed to a grid).It seems Samsung has never heard of [vertical rhythm](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/8-point-grid-vertical-rhythm-90d05ad95032) which is a big red flag that they're either lazy or inexperienced designers.This isn’t stuff that’s just ‘my preference’ – this is graphic design 101 and objective errors that an experienced designer simply wouldn’t make. As a professional interface designer, I’ve spent hours monkeying around with Good Lock and Hex (see below) and still can’t get it consistent – even with a commitment to ongoing manual effort. No other UIs have these overt interface-design issues – even the crazy Chinese ones. Samsung really need to up their out-of-the-box user experience.## Good Lock and _Hex# are solutions to a problem that shouldn’t exist.A lot of the above can be solved with a combination of Good Lock and Hex, but it’s not ideal. Don’t get me wrong; it’s better to have Good Lock than not. But no matter how hard you work, you’re going to end up with jank, a tonne of ongoing manual work to keep on top of it, and an ongoing battle between the Hex developers and OneUI releases.For example, you can change icon shapes from squircle to circle, but you’ll still find squircles tucked away that pop up and surprise you at random points in your usage. And of course, you have to re-build and re-apply your *entire* Theme Park theme every time you install a new app, which always seems to over-write icon preferences, causing further work.You can edit your lockscreen to get rid of the erroneous face-match message above, but then no matter what you do, you’ll end up with notifications [overlapping other elements](https://i.imgur.com/JAfZTo9.jpg) and it generally looking bad. Or you have to leave huge gaps, breaking the vertical-rhythm of the layout.Using Hex themes, some icons end up as illegible, being [white icons on a white background](https://i.imgur.com/dfLIem8.jpg) with no easy way to change them etc. And you're completely reliant on the Hex plugin developers to fix [UI bugs](https://i.imgur.com/skmoDHy.jpg), which they don't - at least not for months.I was able to change my power button long press with Good Lock to open an app. However, I changed my mind, reverted to default behaviour, and uninstalled the Good Lock module. Something went wrong, and now I have to keep the Google Lock module installed forevermore, because if I uninstall it, the button behaviour reverts to opening the app instead of the power menu. Arrgh!Basically, these tools are hard work, and the end result is still not as clean / consistent as it would be if it worked properly out of the box. It’s clear that a few dedicated devs at Samsung noticed the shortfalls of the OneUI core and have tried to help users overcome them, but it feels like an afterthought and it is not at all a polished experience. You simply shouldn’t have to rely on janky community workarounds.## LauncherThe OneUI launcher sucks. The horizontal scrolling app drawer is just nasty and slow. And there’s no alphabetical shortcut. Sure, you can change this with Good Lock/HomeUp, but then it looks like [this atrocity](https://i.imgur.com/em0ZAHW.jpg). I don't even know where to start with the issues here. Two rows of irremovable 'recent apps' icons taking up 40% of the screen? The fact that some of the text labels over-run into other elements and get cut off? How about the top icon grid not aligning with the bottom one? It's just objectively incorrectly designed. Samsung evangelists will frequently tell you that you can change anything you don't like via Good Lock, but this is exactly the kind of result you'll get in doing so.You can always swap launcher to something like Nova, but since Android 10, that’s going to result in a [very clunky experience](https://www.xda-developers.com/third-party-launchers-animation-pixel-phones/); devoid of the smooth closing animations that only stock launchers can offer, and with pretty broken multi-tasking. If you care about experience, third party launchers just aren’t really viable any more – the out of the box experience needs to be better.## The Good## HardwareThe hardware is lovely overall. It feels super solid. I’d have preferred a plastic back like the S21, which felt lighter, but small devices are rare, so I’ll take what I can get.The size is good. I’d prefer a little narrower, but due to the Zenfone 9’s crumby camera and dated looks, I’d say it’s the best ‘small’ android phone right now. Also, the one-handed-mode is much better than any competition as it actually resizes your screen, rather than just cuting the bottom of like the ixel and iPhone.The symmetrical bezels make it look generations better than the Pixel 7 – super premium.I love the camera lens design. The strange hump of the S22, which made it look like some kind of feminine make-up case is gone. It’s now very industrial looking. This design makes the iPhone look busy in comparison. Well done, Samsung!The battery life is fine. It’s not going to break any records, but it consistently lasts the day. Probably a little better than my Pixel 7, but still not as good as my Pixel 6.It’s nice to have a flagship chipset. It isn’t quite as smooth as my Pixel 7 despite the more powerful chip, but it’s fine and it is fast enough at heavier tasks like processing images and videos.Fingerprint reader is perfect. My Pixel 6/7 just didn’t like my fingers unless I licked my thumb before unlocking. I had maybe a 1/10 success rate unlocking the device. The S23 is damned near 100%.&#x200B;## SoftwareNot everything Samsung did was awful. It’s nice to have a bit more control than the Pixel of some aspects of the software experience. The multiwindow is great. Being able to hide the fingerprint animations is fantastic. You aren't stuck with the ugly 'at a glance' widget on your homescreen.You can change a lot, which might be your jam, although as above, I can never get it quite to my liking.Samsung also have some nice touches with their screenshot tool and document scanning in the camera.## EcosystemIt’s nice to have Galaxy SmartTags. It’d be better if the smaller S23 had UWB Bluetooth, which seems a strange omission as both it’s bigger brothers have it. However, they still work good enough.It also plays a little better with my Galaxy Watch 5.It was very easy to find a quad lock and magsafe case.## ConclusionThis is why iPhone users think Android is for geeks who spend time fiddling with their handset. Samsung doesn’t give you a choice – they have made some very polarising choices and ommisions that are difficult to work aroundI’m going to keep it because it’s the only reasonably-sized flagship with current gen specs in my opinion, and the ecosystem is stronger than any other Android OEM’s. But I am fully aware that I’m going to spend my time being annoyed about poor design choices.**EDIT: I've now spoken to samsung. I'm out of my cooling off period, but I was hoping they'd make an exception given that I've been discovering more and more issues. The couldn't. Their suggestion is to buy a more modern car because S23 is modern and Samsung don't worry about backwards compatibility - even with pretty static technology like Bluetooth. They believe that my car stereo, Pixel buds, and sim card are all independently broken, even though they work with every other device I've tried.****This was my last Samsung product. Absolute jankware.**"
"Positive","I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro after months of use..Hey guys,Pixel phones have been some of my favourite phones over the past years. I’ve had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship that’s come out. While the Pixel 5 was a really good phone overall, I wished for a more premium phone from Google as it missed some key features like the zoom camera, better haptic motor, and speakers. When Google announced the Pixel 6 lineup, I was cautiously optimistic. On paper, the phones seemed to be the best Pixels ever. So, I went ahead and got both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Here are my thoughts on the phones after using them for about 5 months.**Design and Build Quality**I think Google got a lot right with the design and build quality of the phones. Both phones feel premium in hand. While it was great to have a metal back in the Pixel 5, the plastic coating made it feel like a budget phone last year. I also like that we got to have more colour options this year.While Google got a lot right this year, they weren’t able to hit a home run on everything. Both phones are quite big and somewhat heavy. I wish Google created a smaller model as using the phones with one hand is quite challenging. I’m also not the biggest fan of the glossy back. I think the frosted white from the Pixel 4/XL was the best feeling material Google had and I wish they did something similar this time around.On the bright side, Google used a much higher quality haptic motor this time. Both phones have some of the best haptics on Android devices. Also, the speakers are way better this year. The sound quality is pretty nice and I had no issues with calls or playing media during my time with the phones.**Performance and Battery Life**Pixel phones are known for their buttery smooth performance and clean UI. Even the Pixel 5 was able to be incredibly smooth with mid-range specs. So, it was not surprising to see the Pixel 6 perform like a true flagship. Everything is buttery smooth here and I noticed some processor intensive tasks to be a lot faster on the Pixel 6 vs the Pixel 5. For example, apps install much quicker on the Pixel 6 compared to the Pixel 5.I don’t game on my phones, but for everything I used the phones for, the Pixels delivered some of the fastest Android experience I’ve had.Battery life has been pretty decent in my experience. Both phones easily got me through an entire day. I found the Pixel 6 battery to be slightly better than the Pro. This could be due to the difference in antennas. Both phones would typically have over 30% by the end of the day. While this isn’t as good as the iPhone 13 Pro as I typically have around 40%-50% battery left by the end of the day, I’m pretty comfortable with the Pixel 6’s longevity throughout the day.**Screen and Fingerprint Sensor**The Pixel 6 has a 90hz flat screen and the Pixel 6 Pro has a 120hz curved screen. To be honest, both feel just as smooth. It’s very hard to tell the difference between 90hz and 120hz. But compared to 60hz, both phones feel incredibly smooth. Also, both screens get bright enough for easy day time viewing, so no concerns there.I personally prefer the flat screen of the Pixel 6. The curved screen, while it looks more ""premium"" doesn’t offer the same user experience as the corners are desaturated and there are some accidental touches here and there.The fingerprint sensor on the phone is absolute trash. This is one of the worst fingerprint sensors I’ve ever used. It has gotten better with updates, but it still misses like 50% of the time when my hands are very dry. It's particularly bad outdoors for some reason. I’ve tried scanning my fingers multiple times, but that still doesn’t fix the issue. This is almost a dealbreaker as this is one of the only biometric unlock methods and Google doesn’t offer face unlock. I really miss the rear fingerprint sensor from the Pixel 5. **Software Experience**I have mixed feelings about the software. Performance wise, the phone absolutely flies and offers some of the best Android experience. Even comparing to new flagships like the S22 Ultra, I feel the Pixel is smoother in day-to-day use. However, I feel Google is taking a step back with Android 12. While it looks prettier than older releases, usability has gotten worse. For example, there’s no more wifi toggle. You have to go to internet and then change your wifi. You can’t get rid of the at a glance widget on the home screen, which I don’t understand. The only way you can have a clean home screen is through a third party launcher, but then the animations aren’t as smooth when you’re multi-tasking unless you root the phone. Also, not sure if this is a widespread issue, but I found notifications on the Pixel 6 to be slower than the iPhone 13. Emails notifications in particular took a minute or two longer than iPhones to show up.On the other hand, there’s a lot of stuff to love. Google is offering 5 years of security updates, which is way better than most Android phone makers. Call screening is still one of my favourite features and I wish more phones had something like this. I also really like the new widgets you get with Android 12. They really add to the fun vibe Google is trying to create with Android 12.Also, Pixel 6 has some of the best voice recognition I’ve experienced with a phone. The phone instantly recognizes everything I say. It really makes you feel like you’re living in the future.I hope Google starts to offer a mode similar to Dex on the Pixels. As phones get more powerful, it’ll be great to expand the ways we use our phones.**Camera**I have mixed feelings here as well. Google was the king of smartphone photography for at least 3 years and it was one of the main reasons I used Pixel as my daily driver. This is also the reason I started [ShotbyPixel](https://instagram.com/shotbypixel) years ago. This year, I was very excited about the cameras as Google finally changed the sensors and offered more than 2 cameras. On paper, Google was set to be the camera champ once again, but reality ended up being quite different.The ultra wide angle camera isn’t wide enough. The quality is quite average and the shots I got weren’t as nice as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S21/S22 Ultra. The main camera took stunning pictures most of the time, but it also missed more than previous Pixels. Also, I feel Google went overboard with the processing. Photos have a very digital overprocessed look to them at times, which I’m not a big fan of. On the bright side, the bigger sensor gets some nice shallow depth of field. It’s good for closeups, but not great when taking photos of documents as the camera isn’t able to focus on entire documents.The selfie camera is also quite average. I like that it’s wide, but I wasn’t a big fan of the end result.The telephoto camera surprised me in a good way. I love the shots that I was able to get from the camera. The 4x telephoto really lets you [frame photos in a way most phones don’t](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbn7dgl4nZ/). Also, the short minimum focusing distance almost makes this a macro camera as well. While I don’t think most people should spend the extra money to get the Pro for the telephoto camera, it’s worth the investment if you take a lot of photos.**Final Thoughts**I think Google got a lot right this year with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Both phones look and feel great, and offer exceptional performance and software experience. Plus the price of the regular 6 makes it very easy to recommend to most people who want an iPhone like experience on Android. I hope Google continues to invest in the Pixel ecosystem. The phone has a lot of potential, but the lack of accessories such as a Pixel watch really work against it when compared to Samsung or Apple phones. If Google is able to improve some of the software issues and fix the fingerprint sensor, the next Pixel has a serious shot at being the best Android phone. For now, I think the Samsung S series still provide a better overall experience due to the ecosystem and features."
"Positive","USB Type C Charging: What We Know (and Don't).##**Note: Some have brought to my attention that it is not confirmed that the Nexus 6P/5X utilizes PD2.0 and in fact may not. If so, this is an embarrassing oversight if I spread incorrect information; I'm researching this further and will make corrections where appropriate when I can confirm the details, apologies.**There’s been a bunch of questions and confusion around the new USB Type-C connector that is now making its way into several new Android phones (e.g., OnePlus 2, Nexus 5X, and the Nexus 6P) and what this means for fast charging, data transfer speeds, and more.**1) The connector, the cable, the data transfer speeds (signal), and the power delivery are all different things**This will be the toughest part for consumer adoption of the various new USB standards--things used to feel pretty simple with USB 2.0. Now, there are differences between the specifications in the types of connectors, cables, data, and power. [Android Police’s article here offers a pretty good overview](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/14/the-new-usb-type-c-connector-a-practical-guide-to-the-next-generation-of-data-and-power-ports/). And this is [a pretty good primer on the different USB connector types](http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb).The new USB Type C connector and cable is designed to potentially support all the cool new things, high speed data transfer, faster charging, etc. However, as we’ve seen with the OnePlus 2, one can have USB Type C connector, but offer traditional USB 2.0 data transfer and power transfer. And conversely, with the new Nexus phones, one can have Type C with only USB 2.0 data, but still benefit from “fast charging”—or what’s known as the USB “Power Delivery 2.0” specification. In fact, this USB fast charging spec can even use the traditional USB 2.0 Type-A connectors and cables (we’ll get to this in a second).**2) Before Power Delivery 2.0 there was Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0**The “battery problem” with smartphones has been a known issue for years, and the idea of fast charging has come up recently as an interim solution to the more intractable problem of improving battery capacity. [Though the USB PD2.0 specs were only finalized roughly a year ago](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8539/usb-power-delivery-v20-and-billboard-device-class-v10-specifications-finalized), Qualcomm has been actively developing a competing standard on this front (as a value-add and defensible lockin for its Snapdragon platform), having [announced its Quick Charge 2.0 standard in Februrary 2013](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2013/02/20/qualcomm-quick-charge-20-less-time-charging-more-time-doing). QC2.0 phones hit the stage in spring of 2014 and today there is a fairly robust ecosystem of QC2.0 compatible phones and chargers—particularly buoyed by the fact that the standard utilized existing USB2.0 Type-A and micro-USB B connectors. The QC2.0 specification allows for [power transfer of up to 24 watts for smartphones and other small devices](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/snapdragon/2015/06/30/qualcomm-quick-charge-20-technology-explained), and even more on Snapdragon powered Chromebooks, large tablets, and other large devices. **3) Nexus 5X/6P “Fast Charging”: ~~The new USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification~~** ##**This section may be revised pending fact checking, apologies.**The launch of the Nexus 6P/5X brought forth some of the first smartphones with USB-C connectors *and* powered by the new Power Delivery 2.0 specification--a specification designed around the growing needs of power delivery for electronic devices and the ubiquity of the USB standard. PD2.0 allows for potential transmission of power of up to 100W, depending on the connector/cable used. And the PD2.0 standard describes [different power “profiles”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#PD) for different levels of power delivery--obviously not all PD2.0 solutions will deliver 100W. For example, the Type-C connector/cable standard, paired with PD 2.0 is spec’d to deliver up to 60W. [The PD2.0 standards are included in the USB 3.1 spec zip package available at the USB IF.](http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_31_072715.zip) As we see with the Nexus 6P/5X, PD2.0 is decoupled from the USB3 data transfer and connector standards. In fact, PD2.0 spec allows for existing connector designs (shapes, basically), including the traditional Type-A (see ""third party PD2.0 chargers"" below) (assuming the connector and cable meets PD2.0 increased power delivery standards).**4) The USB 2.0 Problem, and the QC2.0/PD2.0 Solution**The problem under our existing USB2.0 standards is that we are effectively capped at 5V and ~2.1-2.4A as the practical upper limit on current throughput. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure where the number comes from because published max current for the USB 2.0 specs are much lower; I can only assume this is a best known practical upper limit assuming the worst case scenarios of cables/connectors for USB2.0 (I’d love to be enlightened on this). In general thinner wires will offer more resistance and so too much current pumping through cables/connectors not designed for such current will run into nontrivial safety problems (heat, melting). So even if we were to get a thick cable with an appropriately beefy connector, we will still be capped out here because of the need for specifications to max at the lowest common denominator; there is no way for the power source (charger) and sink (the phone, device, etc.) to communicate and negotiate a safe, higher current even though the devices and interconnect can handle it.So the obvious solution both QC2.0 and PD2.0 arrive at is **(1)** to offer improved specs on cables/connectors (which is eased on the PD2.0 side with a brand new cable/connector spec in USB Type-C), but more importantly **(2)** allow the source and sink to talk to each other (establish a “contract in PD2.0 parlance) and decide the appropriate amount of current/voltage that the devices/cable/connector can handle and to be able to dynamically adjust the appropriate amount of current/voltage while charging to reflect changing power needs and circumstances.**5) Can I charge my Type-C Nexus 6P/5X with my QC2.0 Charger?: QC2.0/PD2.0 Interoperability/Backwards Compatibility**The short answer: Yes, you can use your QC2.0 charger to charge your Nexus (or other PD2.0 device) but output will be limited to 5V ~2A (10W).The long answer: Because both QC2.0 and PD2.0 standards contemplate the use of legacy connector standards (Type-A and micro-USB), both QC2.0 and PD2.0 safely manage backwards compatibility through the aforementioned handshaking process that first validates that the device and charger both support the standard and can engage in increased voltage/current. Absent the appropriate handshake, the devices and chargers will safely default to the original USB2.0 specification: 5V and ~2.0A (~ 10 watts) in the case of QC2.0, and VsafeV5 for PD2.0. So in other words, the new Nexus 6P/5X owners can safely use their existing QC2.0 chargers, but they will effectively be ""fast"" USB 2.0 chargers, capping out at ~10W of power. **6) So what can I use to fast charge my Nexus 5X/6P devices?**Yes, the PD2.0 ecosystem is still in its infancy. We’re only looking at a handful of chargers that are known to support the PD2.0 spec: the [Apple Macbook 12 \(2015\) charger](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ262LL/A/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter) (29 W), the [Chromebook Pixel 2 charger](https://store.google.com/product/universal_type_c_60w_charger) (60W), and then two phone chargers coming out with the Nexus launch ([15W](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_charger)) and ([22.5W](https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_dual_port_charger)). There are [some](http://www.amazon.com/TalentCell-Charger-Chromebook-Supported-Smartphones/dp/B013P0CG9O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443990343&sr=8-1&keywords=macbook+usb+3+charger) third [party chargers](http://www.amazon.com/TalentCell-Intelligent-Chromebook-Supported-USB-Powered/dp/B00YIVCWNK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1443990343&sr=8-2&keywords=macbook+usb+3+charger) (notably with Type-A connectors) that claim to support the Pixel 2 and new MacBook, but the labeling standards aren’t PD2.0 don’t appear to have been fully implemented so consumers like us will be left guessing for a while which chargers truly support the PD2.0 standard. Also note that, current first party chargers have opted to either hardwire the cable to the charger or include only a Type-C connector, so there's an open question as to what the tradeoffs are for implementing Type-A in the third party chargers and why Apple and Google have steered away from this. **7) How Much Faster is Power Delivery 2.0 on the Nexus 6P?”When announcing the Nexus 6P Google’s Dave Burke said, “the Nexus 6P can charge fully in about half the time as the iPhone 6 Plus.” It’s a vague comment, but thankfully AnandTech is peerless in its testing rigor. [The iPhone 6 Plus comes with a 5W charger \(likely 5V 1A\), and charges ~3.2 hours](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8572/the-iphone-6-plus-review-apples-first-phablet/2). So we're looking at a ballpark charge time of ~1.6 hours for the Nexus 6P ([Edit: which was later confirmed in the Nexus Product Team AMA to be 97 minutes, thanks /u/eMinja ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3mzrl9/hi_im_hiroshi_lockheimer_here_at_google_with_the/cvjjnp0)). Unfortunately Burke doesn’t explicitly state what kind of Apple charger, as the iPhone is known to charge faster with an iPad charger (5V 2.4A), and charging at ~2A is really the standard by which power users (/r/android) judges fast charging by.For comparison’s sake, the Nexus 6 (3220mAh) with its [15W QC2.0 OEM charger](https://www.motorola.com/us/accessories/power-storage/chargers/Motorola-TurboPower-Chargers/motorola-turbopower-chargers.html#motorola-turbopower-chargers-specs) is [tested by AnandTech to fully charge in 1.9 hours](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8687/the-nexus-6-review/2), so in theory, fast charging with PD2.0 on the Nexus 6P *may* take a little less time to fully charge (~1.6 hours) on a slightly larger battery. In other words, it looks like there is comparable performance between QC2.0 and PD2.0 15W chargers.This leads us to...**8) What We Don’t Know**Since the product market for USB Type-C and Power Delivery 2.0 is very much so in its infancy, there’s not a lot of practical experience with it (at least that I could find), so there are a lot of unknowns (even all my earlier points are subject to correction). Here are some notable ones:* **Will the Nexus 6P/5X take advantage of higher wattage PD2.0 chargers like that on the Pixel 2 and 2015 Macbook? Or are their input voltage/current limited to the 5V 3A contemplated by its bundled charger?** *I'd be curious to try out the Pixel 2 charger with the Nexus 6P I have on the way** **What will be the impact of [third-party cable/connector convertors](http://www.monoprice.com/pages/usb_31_type_c) on PD2.0 charging efficiency?** *The PD2.0 spec is dependent on cables and connectors meeting the increased potential voltage and current throughput (and has safety features to back down to USB2.0 levels of charging where connector/cables don’t meet the standard) so it’s unclear what happens when you say mate a legacy cable with a convertor cable from Monoprice.** **Will charging via PD2.0 harm my battery?** (*this is tongue in cheek ;), just like for QC2.0, we'll never answer this question to anyone's satisfaction*)* ...Anyway I hope that helps to clear things up; I welcome any input, corrections, or additional insight. ***This post is subject to edits and corrections.****Glossary Note: power delivery is typically described in terms of voltage, current, and watts. The power (or watts) is simply the voltage times the current. In an imperfect analogy, if you were to compare electricity flow to a water hose, the pressure of the water is the voltage (and so mismatching voltages will damage devices, USB is set to 5V), and current is the size of the hose. The overall flow is the watts, or power.*"
"Positive","I feel like there's no (mid to high end) Android phone on the market right now that doesn't have major issues. Is that true or is the community just a bit nit picky?.Hi!Right, so, going through a bunch of reddit threads and videos and stuff like that I really have the feeling that all phones people talk about (that's why I excluded the budget phones) have some serious issues compared to a few years ago.* LG: gone* HTC: gone* Huawei: no Google stuff which might or might not be an issue for some but for most average consumers it is* Chinese phones: apparently Chinese spyware on the phone? Haven't looked much into it but read it in an off sentence somewhere* Samsung: Shitty chip in Europe that's causing issues. Unethical advertising (something with the Camera or screen refresh rate?). The Flip 4 with a hinge that breaks pretty easily.* Pixel: I'm pretty sure the Pixel 6 causes more extreme reactions from people on here than iOS. Either people absolutely hate it or are willing to defend it with their lives.* Asus: The zenfone doesn't seam to be as much of a hot topic but also some complaints.And I feel like this extends to the whole ecosystem. Smart watch? If you really need one get a Samsung WearOS watch but it's stills hit. Pixel watch announced? Google is gonna fuck it up anyway!Android in general seems to receive a lot of critique and I can't really pinpoint where people are coming from because I'm a bit out of the loop. Some are very obvious like bad system backups but some are a bit more vague. Like ""Google is removing features"" (what features?) and ""Battery drain is insane"" (what's your reference point? I've been charging my phone every night with a slow charger since the iPhone 3G. Do you expect 2 full days or what?)If we go by the Android community, it feels like Android is hanging by a thread pretty much only saved from irrelevancy by Apple's business practices. It sounds like you guys would switch if Apple allowed side loading, better integration with other ecosystems and had a round smart watch.I'm a bit out of the loop regarding Android. I switched from the iPhone 5 to a HTC One M8 mostly for price and never looked back until the iPhone 12. I was on the pixel phones at this point and always went for stock Android because I liked the ""everything from one company"" idea instead of the bloat from other companies. Then the iPhone 12 because I got nostalgic since the design is very iPhone 4/5.But now I'm bored. I get the itch to get a new phone but iPhone or iOS doesn't excite me. I never felt like either was unintuitive (I'm 99% sure the people that say iOS is an unusable and unintuitive mess are exaggerating but maybe I'm just more used to getting used to new software as a software developer) and always said that both ""just work"" even though only Apple uses that phrase in their marketing.But it feels like nothing happened in the years since I used a WearOS watch except that Samsung ditched Tyzen and that every Android phone in the price range I'd have considered is just plagued by issues that make it almost unusable. And the ecosystem is such a mess that you might as well ignore it and pretend neither tablets nor smart watches exist.So, what's up with that? Are you guys just nit picky and since the situation is generally great you are complaining about unimportant stuff or is it as dire as it looks?"
"Positive","2 Years with the OnePlus 7 Pro - An In-Depth OnePlus/Android Review.######I'd like to preface this by saying I'd previously been using iPhone since 2013 and had been well integrated in the Apple ecosystem (iPad, iPhone, Mac, and later, AirPods and AppleTV) since 2010 with the launch of the original iPad. I switched to OnePlus/Android in 2019 with the launch of the 7 Pro and have been using it as my daily driver since. Therefore, I have very little experience with any of the iPhones or iOS features that have been released in the past two years, but I will do my best to inform myself when necessary. I had also migrated most of my desktop usage to Windows around the same time, but still regularly use Mac when travelling. This will not be a comparison between Mac and Windows by any means, but a few sentences here and there may pop up regarding this when necessary. &nbsp;This review is meant to go as in-depth and unbiased as possible and cover an extremely wide range of topics that I see many of the popular reviewers overlook, whether intentionally or due to simply not being able to use the phone for long enough. Rather than looking like a spec-sheet with a few bits of commentary here and there, I'm looking to describe what using this phone daily for the past two years has been like. Ideally this would serve to guide anyone whose either interested in switching from iOS to Android or upgrading to a OnePlus phone from an existing Android device.&nbsp;My current components in most of my workflow/daily life are:* OnePlus 7 Pro* MacBook Pro 15"" w/ Touchbar - work/editing away from home only* Custom-Built Windows PC - main rig* Samsung Galaxy Buds Live* Ikko OH-10 - Earphones&nbsp;While I've broken down this review into several categories, there will be a lot of overlap as many issues pertain to multiple categories. Categories are as follows:1. Introduction1. Build Quality/Feel1. Screen1. Battery Life/Charging1. Camera1. Photo Software on Oxygen OS/Android 1. Speed1. Oxygen OS - General1. Android 10 - General1.

Conclusion&nbsp;#IntroductionI originally switched to Android after becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of features with Apple’s newest offerings of phones, year after year. That coupled with the high price, and my nearly 4 year old iPhone 6S at its limits (which had had its battery replaced twice and was still barely holding a charge especially in cold weather) made me seriously start to consider an Android phone. I had seen great reviews of the OnePlus 7 Pro and the price seemed to be great value so in 2019, I upgraded.  I’m currently using the T-Mobile variant (not sure if it was even offered with other carriers), in the black color, 8GB RAM + 256 GB storage. Currently running Oxygen OS 11.0.1.3 (Android 11).&nbsp;#Build Quality/FeelThe build quality of the phone is great, and at $700, seems to be on par with most other flagship Android devices of similar design. Waterproofing has been great, and I’ve never had any issues with water damage, even after running it under a sink countless times to clean it. I’ve never liked phones with glass/glossy backs, as they are absolute finger-print magnets, and this phone is no different, but I have been using this phone with a case since week 1, so it has been largely a non-issue. The phone is built well and with a case on, I’ve never had issues with deep scratches on the screen (unless you’re ultra-careful, light ones are inevitable).The reason I’ve been using a case is because the phone is just so terribly designed ergonomically. Not only does the phone feature a curved screen on the front, the back is also symmetrically curved, making the edges rather sharp and quite uncomfortable to hold. Additionally, the amount of glass that is so near the sides makes dropping it a huge concern, further requiring a case.  This has proven to be a small issue 2 years into ownership as it has become increasingly difficult to find 3rd party cases – something I had taken for granted on an iPhone. There are a few options here and there, but if you are looking for something specific, whether it be looks or functionality, you may be out of luck.&nbsp;#DisplayContinuing directly with the need for a case, an equally large reason is the lack of palm rejection built into the phone. The curved edges means that in nearly every orientation that you hold the phone, you are bound to have accidental presses. This occurs even more frequently when you are using it one-handed, and need to stretch and reach across the large screen to press something. Even with phones being so large for so many years now, it is quite evident that the large majority of apps (even stock apps) on Android are not optimized for one-handed use. A huge example of this is the YouTube app. YouTube’s video player has the very handy feature of being able to double tap the left and right sides to forward or rewind the video by 5 second increments. However, using the phone without a case, I have found that my palm will very, very frequently be registered not only as a tap but as several dozens. This results in the video being forwarded or rewinded, depending on which side of the phone you’re holding, by minutes within the span of less than a second. Needless to say, this is extremely frustrating. Using a case reduces the chances of this happening, but unless your case has very raised edges, this still happens here and there. While this may not seem like a huge issue, when combined with the frequent accidental presses, it makes it quite the deal-breaker for me and I will likely never purchase a phone with curved edges again (which seems to be the norm for most new flagship devices). I see reviews constantly saying these phones are not recommended for people with small hands. I’m inclined to believe they shouldn’t be recommended for people with hands at all. As a quick reference, my hands measure from the bottom of my palm to the top of my middle finger, 8”, and outstretched from the tip of my thumb to the tip of my pinky 9.75”. I’ve compiled a series of images depicting common instances where holding your phone would trigger an accidental touch, marked by a red circle at the location of the touch.https://imgur.com/a/54vXh7OYou judge for yourself.On the other hand, the display itself is absolutely wonderful to look at. With the pop-up camera, I get a huge, fullscreen display, devoid of any notches, and this makes browsing content largely a pleasure. The OLED panel means the blacks are truly black, and the other colors are very vibrant, and actually passably similar (for a phone) to my color-calibrated monitor, when viewing photos. The “QHD” (3120x1440) resolution is great and so is the 90HZ refresh rate. I have however turned both of these off to increase my battery life. My other settings are “Screen Calibration – Advanced – Display P3 - ~70% on the warmth slider – Vibrant Color Effect off”. The in-screen fingerprint reader works flawlessly and I’m not sure why Apple is still lagging behind in this regard. &nbsp;#Battery Life/ChargingBattery life has been solid since I’ve received it, and has obviously declined due to the nature of lithium-ion cells. Currently, my battery reads a 3286 mAh, down from the original 4000. Not great, but immensely better than my iPhone 6S which needed a battery replacement near the 2 year mark. On average, I can still get about a day’s usage out of a single charge, and about 4-ish hours of constant screen-on time. Charging has been very fast with the 30 watt charger – but painfully slow with almost everything else. The original cable has also disintegrated near the tips, somehow fairing worse than Apple’s cheap usb-lightning cables. OnePlus uses some sort of proprietary fast charging brick + usb cable combo. I wasn’t able to get fast charging with any sort of combination of usb cables or other fast chargers I have around in my house. After hearing so much about “breaking free of the Apple walled garden”, this seems like a punch in the gut. Not to mention, the official cables/power brick were sold out on OnePlus’s website during the time I needed to replace them, which didn’t help. The phone does get hot while charging – something that I had never noticed on my previous phones. It’s not a complaint by any means, but it is worth pointing out. One other thing to point out is that OnePlus occasionally will not charge my phone past 80%, even with the setting turned off. If I’m near my phone, and notice it, I can click on the pop-up and it will continue charging. However, if I don’t pay attention until I grab my phone when I’m about to head out, I will be stuck with a phone missing a fifth of its battery charge – which with only 4-5 hours of screen-on time is almost an hour off the battery life.&nbsp;#CameraBeing an amateur photographer, I had high hopes of finally upgrading my phone camera for the times when I don’t have my DSLR on hand. I’m going to start off by saying that the 7 Pro’s camera seems technically quite capable. Optical-Image Stabilization and Laser AF means that the vast majority of my shots are crisply in focus, and focused accurately. The catch? Only during the daytime. Outdoors. When its sunny. This is not a high bar to pass. Anytime the camera does not see sunlight, it struggles greatly. This is even the case in a brightly lit indoor room. The focus misses occasionally, and the details quickly disappear. This issue is exemplified with OnePlus’s absolutely terrible image processing. Oversaturated, oversharpened, contrast boosted. I shoot with all the post-processing settings turned off in app, and even when switching to the Pro mode, and shooting RAW, I still found my photos to be unacceptably oversharpened. The camera software almost always appears to be exposing for the shadows, so much so that nearly every photo is unacceptably overexposed. There is rarely a time when I can just open the camera app and snap a photo and have it coming out looking decent. The bulk of these issues seems to stem from OnePlus’s image processing, and switching to the Google Camera apk has always proved to be a bug-ridden mess. However, I also think a big issue is the fact that so many smart phone manufacturers seem so tunneled on cramming as many megapixels into their cameras as possible. This is nothing but pure marketing, and any amount of research would have quickly informed them that more =/= better. Especially on smartphones, where most of the photos being shared are done so on social media – and then viewed on other smartphones. There is absolutely no reason to sacrifice low-light performance for high resolution files on a smartphone – especially with the limited storage that you do have. I realize that OnePlus has not been known for their camera performance, but also know that they have been “trying to improve”. High megapixel, and making fancy branding deals with Hasselblad as they are doing now is not the move. Even Nikon’s flagship high-resolution mirrorless camera has 3 less megapixels, and that’s on a full frame sensor that is magnitudes larger than the one on a smartphone camera. I also have to mention that the triple-camera (telephoto, normal, wide-angle) setup on the 7 Pro is also very disappointing. There is almost no color or detail continuity between each lens. Furthermore the image stabilization on the telephoto lens is cartoonishly bad, and cause a ton of stuttering and jittery motion while trying to film anything. &nbsp;#Photo Software on OxygenOS/Android The aforementioned issues are made worse with the absolutely terrible photo library management software that OxygenOS comes with. It is inexplicably bad. This was evident on day 1, while importing the photos I had on my iPhone. All the EXIF data was somehow not transferred, and 4 years’ worth of photos and videos now displayed as all having been taken on the same exact day. Frustrating, but not really a deal breaker – they were old photos, and there are many other ways to back those photos up. However, the actual photo library app on OnePlus is more of an issue. Opening it up does not display your most recent photos. Rather it shows some random images from a couple months ago, before taking 10 seconds to finally load your most recent ones. Closing the app, and reopening it again, and you are back to seeing old photos while waiting for your new ones to load. Apparently, out of all the things your phone wants to cache, this is not one of them.Android’s file system is also a headache when it comes to photo management. Photos downloaded from some apps show up in your camera roll, others don’t. They are buried in a random folder that the app has created in your file system. It’s also not clear how to quickly transfer them to your camera roll, as you would have to do so via the file system. A quicker alternative would simply be sharing that photo to an app that you do know will show up in the camera roll, and then redownloading it from there. OnePlus’s photo library app is also frustrating to organize. Open any photo in the “All Photos and Videos” folder, and you will be finding it impossible to locate the add to an album button. It doesn’t exist. Only if you manage to find the photo in some other folder will that button be visible. In fact, OnePlus doesn’t even appear to actually have a real “add to album” feature. For example, if you screenshot something, it will appear in your screenshots album. If you decide to add it to an album, it will then promptly move to said album, and disappear from the screenshots one. On a pc, this might make sense, but on a phone, a library/gallery app should not be a skin for a file system. I’ve been largely using Google’s photos app as a replacement for OnePlus’s photo library app, but even that has some issues when trying to share photos via other apps. Additionally, it has some pretty counter-intuitive designs. For example, say you have an album with a couple of old photos from years ago. You want to share one with a friend, but realize it has some sensitive information on it. You go and crop it out, and then you try and share it, only to find that the edited photo has saved as a copy, and is not automatically placed in the same album. You then have to sift through your entire photo collection to find that specific photo before being able to share it.It's also important to realize how this affects third party photo editing apps or the sharing of photos on social media. Because the “All Photos and Videos” is not actually a folder, it is extremely annoying to import photos into apps. I’m not exactly sure how to explain this as I still have almost no clue how &nbsp;#SpeedI’ll keep this short. I am not a mobile gamer, and for everything else, the phone has been perfectly fast enough. I am using a KLWP wallpaper skin on Nova launcher with a large number of elements, and have not seen any lag. App switching is usually quick and seamless. Other than the aforementioned photo gallery issues, speed has not been a concern for me.&nbsp;#OxygenOS – GeneralI was used to receiving yearly software updates for major software releases when I was on iPhone. This has not been the case with OnePlus. Not only are they massively delayed, they also appear to roll out to users in batches for reasons unknown. I finally was able to upgrade my phone to Android 11 this April, and funnily enough it was against my will. On OxygenOS 10, one of the absolute most annoying features was the keyboard. When using Navigation Gestures (bottom), there would be a ridiculously large gap under the on-screen keyboard. This affected all keyboards, including GBoard and other third-party keyboards. There are countless threads on OnePlus’s forums concerning this, here is an example: https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/gap-under-the-keyboard.1099280/If it was just a gap, I would be to live with it. However, the issue is that if you press any space in the gap, your keyboard will close and your text entry will be deleted. This is extremely frustrating, when for example, you are searching something or typing out a URL on Chrome. As you go to hit enter, you can frequently miss the key by a fraction of a millimeter, and hit the gap. Your entire entry will be cleared, and you will be stuck staring at your screen like a dumbass. Comments on the forums seem split on two things: Whether this is a “feature” or not, and whether this is a OnePlus issue or an Android issue. Whether or not OnePlus regards this as a feature is irrelevant and there is no reason not to have a toggle for this. And while this is technically an Android issue, it does not excuse OnePlus as Samsung’s One UI has an ability to remove the gap when using bottom navigation gestures. Switching to navigation gestures (left and right) on OnePlus does not remove the gap, but removes the issue of it being tappable. However, this is not a viable solution for me as I’m using FNG side gestures as a replacement for the terrible OxygenOS gestures and they conflict one another. This is such a blatant issue that I’ve never seen a single reviewer cover, and is one of the main reasons why I absolutely cannot recommend a OnePlus phone.This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to upgrade to Android 11, as I heard the issue would be resolved (the gap is still there, but it is currently no longer tappable). However, around the same time OnePlus began rolling out its OxygenOS 11 updates, I had stumbled across several forums saying how their phones had gotten bricked. For that reason, I decided to hold off on updating until it was fixed. A couple days later, I was out and had to use my phone until the battery died. After I get home and plug my phone back in, I find that my phone had updated by itself since letting the phone die, and then turning it back on counted as a “restart”. Apparently this is a setting that can be toggled, and is set to on as default, but buried deep in the settings menu, and never once noted to the user. Okay fine, my phone is now on Android 11, let’s see if the keyboard issue is fixed. Lo and behold, my phone is very quickly “bricked”. After powering on, it would randomly crash and reboot after 5-10 seconds, before doing it again, over and over. I was now stuck with an unusable phone. Contacting support was not helpful and it wasn’t only until after a couple hours of digging through forums was I able to find a solution. Turns out having apps that aren’t compatible with Android 11 would cause the phone to be bricked. On top of this, OxygenOS seems to seriously be lacking in system-wide customization options compared to its competitors. There is no option to clear up the clutter on your status bar – it’s constantly cluttered with notifications. Samsung has this feature. There is no always-on display, although I do not particularly care for this. There is no option to turn off the album art of your currently play song as being stretched across your lock screen. The settings app is a clusterfuck to navigate, and even slower to search for particular settings in. You can only add up to 5 fingerprints – for those that care. I still constantly get notifications for “Zen Mode” despite doing my best to disable everything regarding that app. There is no way to sort notifications in your pull-down menu. The settings app is never cached – meaning if you switch apps, and switch back, you’re stuck back at the main settings page. The list goes on – nitpicky to some but an absolute dealbreaker for many. &nbsp;#Android 10 – GeneralRegarding notifications, I’m not sure if this is an Android-wide issue, or simply a OnePlus one. The inability to sort notifications by most recent is beyond incomprehensible. Unless you’re the type of person who constantly clears all your notifications, you will often find your phone vibrating in your pocket, and upon pulling it out and checking your notifications, you have absolutely no idea what it was. A workaround is to create a shortcut on your homepage linking to the notification log inside your phone’s settings page – if you can find it. There you’ll be able to check notifications sorted by most recent. Other than that, Android 10 had been absolutely fantastic. The ability to customize your home screen to the finest details, animations, etc. with apps like Nova Launcher and KLWP made my phone feel truly unique – something I never experienced before on iOS. I’ll touch on this later, but media consumption has also been largely a fantastic experience. The amount of unique apps that let you customize your UX like FNG are awesome. Having a file system is pretty great as well (other than for photos), and makes me really feel like having a fully featured productivity device. The option to create custom shortcuts to specific app actions lets me do things like being able to control the lights with just a tap on my home screen which is great. Having the ability to have third party adblockers like AdGuard is also fantastic for internet browsing. Another thing to point out – and this is only half Android’s fault – is that you cannot use a system adblocker on top of a VPN. I have NordVPN, and their built in adblocker sucks. However, I have to choose between AdGuard’s adblocker – which like the thousands of other adblockers out there, functions as you’d expect it it – and running a VPN. I picked the former. I don’t really have the patience or time to go around trying out other VPN’s as this isn’t really an issue for me since the main reason I got a VPN was for my desktop. Just a thing to note though. Even just having the ability to have a system-wide adblock for browsing is more than enough for me. The only downsides would have to be the terrible camera support from third party apps such as Instagram. Due to there being so many Android phones out there, Instagram does not actually support your phone’s camera. From my understanding, it essentially takes a screen recording/snapshot of what your camera is showing which results in noticeably worse quality photos and videos. Additionally, as neither I nor most of my friends or coworkers use texting (SMS) as our main form of communication, that dreaded “green iMessage” problem has not been an issue for me. Overall, the only thing I can firmly say I miss about iOS would be its camera processing, Instagram support, and photo gallery organization. And also how notifications are handled.&nbsp;#Android 11 – GeneralOh man, Android 11. The ability to be able to quickly control all your smart devices without having to mess around with shortcuts is great – although it never really bothered me in the first place. Besides this and the fix for the keyboard gap, I really can’t notice any other improvements. The new bubble’s system is worse than Facebook Messenger’s own integration, and now you only have the option of using Android’s version or none at all. Grouping all my conversation notifications at the top is actually a step backwards – there still is no way to sort them by most recent. And by far the most annoying thing is that Android 11 seems to have disabled ANT+ connectivity. I use ANT+ for my powermeter on my bicycle, connected to my phone via IpBike. I don’t ride nearly as frequently as I should to justify having a dedicated cycling computer, and that setup had worked just as well as any cycling computer would minus having a fancy display to look at. Now it’s nothing more than a paperweight. At the moment, I don’t think I can recommend anyone who is currently on Android 10 and relies on ANT+ in any capacity to upgrade to 11. That coupled with the potential to brick your phone due to incompatibility definitely makes it a no go in my book. &nbsp;#Android Customization As stated before, Android’s customization is absolutely amazing and leagues ahead of anything offered on iOS. If you’re into these types of things, I wholeheartedly recommend checking out Android.&nbsp;#Integration with GoogleAs for integration with Google, being an Android device it has little issues pairing with any of Google’s other products (Google Home, chromecast, etc.) Other than that, I don’t really see anything that jumps out to me as particularly innovative. On the software side, the Chrome integration is still lagging behind what other browsers are offering. A password manager is about as far as it gets with well-integrated and bug free implementation. There’s no clipboard continuity, ability to share images or files, seamlessly switch between desktop and mobile browsing. The lack of a serious Airdrop competitor is quite frustrating at times, but there are always some alternatives if you look hard enough. &nbsp;#Integration with Windows 10I’ll also keep this short. Other than the aforementioned lack of integration with Chrome on the desktop, there’s not much else to talk about. Windows 10 has a phone companion app which lets me see all my phone notifications on my desktop, as well as receive (but not send) photos from my phone to my PC. I can also read and reply to text messages, which is handy the few times I do need to. &nbsp;#Audio/Audio AccessoriesHaving no headphone jack, I was forced to purchase a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle. The DAC’s in these tiny dongles are pretty abysmal, and if I recall correctly, the first one I bought wasn’t even compatible for some reason. I also wasn’t able to get USB Audio Player PRO to work with any of these dongles either. I occasionally see some reviewers praise smartphone speakers for having “deep, rich, and clear sound”. https://www.cnet.com/reviews/oneplus-7-pro-value-camera-update-waterproof-test-review/For a smartphone, I could say they sound decent for what they are, good even. But saying the “audio was clear and rich, with lots of depth and range” sounds like borderline marketing BS to me. Other than that, the 7 Pro offers a very, very basic EQ. It has 10-bands, but no marking of what frequency each band is, leaving you guessing out of your ass. There’s also several V-shaped “presets” that apply on top of your EQ. Integration with my Galaxy Buds Live has been decently seamless, but after updating to Android 11, I’ve noticed hiccups a lot more frequently. &nbsp;#Connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth/ANT+/GPS)Regarding WiFi and Bluetooth, it generally seems to perform as expected. However, even with OnePlus’s version of intelligent WiFi control enabled, my phone still seems to really want to grasp onto my home’s WiFi, even when I’m far enough away from my house that I essentially get no WiFi signal. ANT+ being disabled is, again, a major disappoint. However, on Android 10, it worked perfectly fine on both my powermeter and my home trainer. Regarding GPS, I’ve noticed that it appears to be a lot less precise than that of my iPhone. Whether it’s going on bike rides, runs, walks, or even using it for navigation whilst driving, I’ve noticed that the positioning is never smooth even if I were moving in a straight line. &nbsp;#Use as a Fitness DeviceHaving previously used an iPhone 6S, I was originally really excited to move up to a much bigger and better screen. I still love it, but as a fitness device, its unwieldiness becomes very apparent. Additionally, with the wacky GPS performance, I’ve gotten the occasional inconsistencies regarding routes on Strava. &nbsp;#CallingCall quality was clear and rich, with lots of depth and range. Jokes aside, it’s a phone and calling works as I’d expect it to. No complaints here. &nbsp;#Media ConsumptionMedia consumption is absolutely fantastic on Android. With the ability to use apps like YouTube Vanced (which if you aren’t already, I’d highly recommend doing so), I don’t think I could ever go back to having an ad-filled YouTube experience on iOS. Additionally, most apps have the ability to scale the video you’re watching to full screen, which is wonderful on the notchless 7 Pro. A tip for those who occasionally consume movies on your browser, but find that the black bars and lack of any zoom functions when viewing videos full screen essentially means you’re watching a shrunken video – download Samsung Internet Browser. It has an in-app video player that needs to be toggled on in the settings. It is by far the best video player I’ve ever used in any browser, and has the ability to swipe to control brightness, volume, and even precise fast-forwarding and rewinding. The only thing missing is subtitle support on some websites. &nbsp;#Integration with Apple Products/AccessoriesThe only thing I’ll put here is that Android does not work well with AirPods. You can’t see their battery level for some reason, leaving you guessing. Also, there’s absolutely no integration with Mac’s either, but I’m neither surprised nor bothered by it.&nbsp;#Comparisons with other Android PhonesWhile I’m not usually the type of person who wants to upgrade my phone each year, two years, or like previously, four years, I do still try and keep up to date with new product releases. One thing that has stuck out to me has been Sony’s narrower smartphones, the Xperia 5 II/III in particular. Having a narrower smartphone means much better one-hand usability, and the lack of any curved screens only improves it. Sony being a camera manufacturer, and the Xperia series having its own dedicated pro camera and video apps hopefully means that they do see some trickle down benefits from their Alpha department. Other than that, I have to say that the original reason that I picked up a OnePlus was simply because of how much value they seemed to offer over the competition. It seems like the new smartphones these days are climbing in price, year after year. Unless you’re seriously on a budget, and really don’t mind any of the issues I’ve laid out here, I don’t think I can recommend a OnePlus, despite its surface level value (not to mention that, if I’m not mistaken, OnePlus has also raised their prices). Based on the countless features I come across Samsung phones having when trying to fix an issue on my OnePlus device, I would recommend Samsung. Only downside to their phones is that the minimum font size for their newest devices is ridiculously large. I haven’t had much experience with Pixel phones, but they seem to be of great value as well.&nbsp;#Comparisons with iPhone – Aggregated* Build quality is on par* Battery life (both per charge, and battery health lifespan) is much better* Camera is significantly worse (If I recall correctly, switching from lens to lens on iPhone is also significantly more consistent)* Image processing is significantly worse* USB C – Apple what are you doing* Much better screen – I can’t stress this enough, the notch on iPhone needs to shrink* Has ANT+ (Or I should say had)* Has an in-screen fingerprint reader&nbsp;#Comparisons with iOS – Aggregated######Please keep in mind that I have not used an iOS device for a significant period of time since I switched to Android* Notifications are significantly worse* Photo library management is significantly worse* Has a file system* Customization is not even comparable, even with the newest iOS updates – Android wins by miles* Worse in-app camera integration* Better browsing experience – Vanced, adblock* Better utility apps simply due to the nature of Android being much more open and accessible than iOS* Worse GPS consistency* Google’s Voice Assistant is preferable to Siri* Google Play Store is on par with the App Store* iOS has a much cleaner status bar&nbsp;#ConclusionOverall I would say that while my standards may be higher than some, I still really can’t recommend any OnePlus phones. I do however highly recommend Android phones if you’re the type of person who enjoys customizing your phone, and are also fed up with Apple’s lack of modern features. Funny that while bashing on some review sites, I end up at the same conclusion as most of them. I wrote this in my free time over the course of a couple days, and may have missed a couple things or have some errors here and there. Please let me know if there's anything I missed that you'd like to know, or if there's any errors. No TLDR, sorry. For those that got through to the end, thanks for reading!"
"Positive","Thoughts on Pixel 2 XL from an iPhone X user.I've been an iPhone user since the 4S days and have owned every new iPhone since then. Currently using the 256GB iPhone X. I have flirted with Android phones briefly in between. Had the Note 4, Nexus 6P and S7 Edge for brief periods but went back to the iPhone. I was looking for a secondary phone to my iPhone X and I really wanted to avoid getting another iPhone, so thought why not try the other side of the grass? So got myself the panda Pixel 2 XL 128GB. Here are my brief, random thoughts on the phone as well as the software. Won't be taking about the camera as I've not tested it thoroughly.**Hardware**It's not as good as the iPhone X or the S8 Plus, plain and simple. However, it's not bad at all. I like the somewhat plastic feeling of the aluminium back. I love that Google doesn't take itself too seriously and is brave enough to try interesting things like the orange power button and the panda back. It's a big phone, the bezels are smaller than most 2016 phones, but bigger than most 2017 Android phones and positively massive compared to the iPhone X. It's not easy to carry this phone around in one hand. The front facing speakers are a nice touch, but not as good as the solution on the iPhone X.The screen is, for lack of a better word, thoroughly mediocre. I don't see any blue tint issues and I have not experienced any burn in. What I do see is uneven backlight on dark colors and a persistent 'grainy' or 'dirty' or 'sandpaper' look throughout the screen. It's not as smooth as any LCD or the OLED on the iPhone. Switching between the 2 phones really highlights how far ahead the iPhone X's display is. Not even close.**Notifications**I'll copy-paste a comment I made on AndroidPolice.Notifications are terrible on iOS purely from a design standpoint such as having an endless list that takes up too much space, but in just about every other way that you'd normally use a phone, they're somewhat superior to Android. Let me explain.- On my Pixel 2 XL, I cannot set each app to NOT vibrate AND play a sound when my phone isn't on silent mode. For example, if I turn off vibration in Hangouts, it will not vibrate when the phone isn't silent, but will when the phone is on silent. If I do the same for Facebook Messenger, it won't vibrate even when the phone is on silent. There is no rhyme or reason here, and each app behaves in either of the 2 ways. The vibration motor on the Pixel 2 XL is noisy and cheap, and I don't like hearing it every time a notification comes in when the phone isn't even on vibration mode. Is it the app developers fault? Who gives a shit. Why isn't there a universal toggle in the sound menu under the phone settings to A) vibrate always and B) vibrate only when silent.- Notification dots. A dot! On iOS it's a number, far more meaningful, easily tells me how many unread messages I have etc without having to count them on the notification drop-down menu.-Notification sounds. This is somewhat peculiar. On iOS, most third party apps have their own distinct notification sound, something not from the default sound picker on iOS. Developers have chosen more relevant sounds. On Android? I am forced to choose between the ridiculously inappropriate selection of notification sounds from the system. I am forced to use the same one for outlook, gmail and Flamingo because the rest available are so clown-like. No, I'm going to go on the internet on a crusade to hunt down custom sounds.-Delayed notifications. Android aggressively throttles notifications. I had to manually put my most used apps in the list of 'battery unoptimised' apps just so that they can notify me in realtime.-I have sometimes seen notifications appear on the ambient display even when the phone is on DND and that app isn't set to ignore it.Where Android excels, and I mentioned it before, is design. Notification cards are stacked, don't take a lot of space, and I like the icons that appear in the status bar. There was supposed to be some cool new notification channel feature on Oreo but my god, the developers on Android are the laziest bunch I have ever seen. Good luck seeing this feature ever getting widely adopted.**General UI and performance**I LOVE stock Android. It's beautiful, it's consistent, it's colorful and it's so...playful. Where iOS is your suited and booted guy, Android is your casual khaki wearing dude (sorry for the terrible comparison). The live wallpapers that come on the Pixel 2 are so, SO nice. I love how there are little things I can do here that I can't on iOS. I can see the WiFi link speed between my phone and my router (really helped diagnosing some networking issues), I can use an app to see realtime bandwidth use. I love how the music notification changes color according to album art. iOS is plain and boring in comparison.Google Assistant > Siri. I don't think much needs to be said here. Google is scarily good in this area. It notifies me when to leave for work! Voice dictation is almost 100% accurate.Apps on Android are terrible. It's sad, because they've always been terrible and I thought things would improve. First party apps like Facebook, IMDB, Twitter, Snapchat etc are just better designed on iOS and they perform better as well. I've seen weird and inconsistent scrolling and random jank on almost all third party apps. It really ruins the experience of an otherwise wonderful stock experience.I've yet to see a third-party Twitter client that even comes close to Tweetbot or Twitterrific. I've tried Flamingo and Talon, and they mediocre at best. I've yet to see a podcast app that comes close to Overcast. I've yet to see a more wonderful weather app than Carrot Weather. Third party state of affairs is unfortunately not as good as expected.Some of the apps straight up don't work. Microsoft Remote Desktop has scaling issues, my Samsung TV remote app refuses to connect to my TV.**Battery**6 hours of SOT on WiFi and very little drain in standby. Much better than what I experienced on the S7 Edge and S8 (non plus). It's pretty similar to the iPhone X I believe.**Conclusion**It's hard to pick one over the other to be honest. If you want Android-specific things then this phone is the one to get. But for general usage, I feel the iPhone X offers better performance and an unbeatable ecosystem of apps."
"Positive","The Nexus 5X and Google Fi: my 2 month review.Two months ago, I decided to switch from Verizon to Google Fi in order to purchase a Nexus 5x. Overall, I have really enjoyed the switch. I always wish that people would review products after they have owned them for several months, so I decided to do that myself. I hope that this helps some of you who might be on the fence! (I also posted in /r/Nexus, but I thought you all might appreciate this write-up as well)**Nexus 5X***Hardware*: I'll be completely honest, I think that we've reached the point where 95% of the hardware differences between mainstream phones will not significantly affect your user experience. One phone might have 5% more pixels or a slightly slower processor, but unless you are doing a side-by-side comparison this will have 0% impact on your enjoyment of the phone. Therefore, I will be focusing on hardware elements that stand out to me as a user because they are noticeably good, bad, or unique to the phone.* *Size*: The display is 5.2in, which I believe is the perfect size. I am a man with medium-sized hands, and I struggle to use anything bigger one-handed. I also don't want to own anything that would be described as a phablet, because I hate that word and want to punch anyone who uses it unironically.* *Shape*: I'm honestly not crazy about the phone's shape. It has an almost perfectly flat back, which fits less comfortably into my hand than phones with a nice concave shape. The edge is a bit sharp, which means that cradling the phone on my fingers for a long time irritates my skin a little. Nothing terrible, but the overall effect is that it doesn't feel great to hold. I don't use a phone case (bravery and/or stupidity), but I'm sure that this issue would be lessened by a nice ergonomic case. The phone is reasonably slim and light, though, so that's a plus.* *Display*: Looks good. Good contrast, nice colors, good viewing angles. Like I said before, I feel like this area often gets over-hyped: most phones have surpassed the human eye's ability to notice much of a difference, so unless your phone has a remarkably bright/dim/over/under-saturated display it's all kind of a wash.* *Battery*: Surprisingly good! I use my phone pretty heavily, and I've only run out of charge before the end of the day one time. I like the USB-C, which charges my phone very quickly. The only downside is that I've spent the past 10 years collecting an arsenal of USB chargers that are now all useless. Not a big deal at the moment, since my battery longevity is still good, but I may need to buy a backup charger once the battery starts to degrade.* *Fingerprint Scanner*: This is seriously the greatest feature that I never knew I needed. By far the fastest and easiest way to unlock your phone. I pull my phone out of my pocket, put my finger on the scanner located on the back of the phone, and by the time the phone is eye-level it's been woken up and unlocked. It seems to be reasonably secure, according to my informal tests (aka my friends trying and failing to use their own unregistered fingerprints to unlock it). Overall, the fingerprint scanner is one of the those features that sets the 5X apart from the pack. It works so smoothly and elegantly, it makes the phone feel next-gen.*Software*: This is the reason why I got a Nexus. I was tired of bloatware, redundant software, and slow updates. I wanted the Apple UI experience, but with the customization and features of an android phone. In my opinion, people spend too much time looking at hardware. They should be looking at software. After all, the operating system dictates how you actually interact with this $600 piece of technology you are holding.Marshmellow is amazing. I have made the decision to add as little redundancy as possible. No third-party launchers, no SMS apps... as much as possible, I want to keep it stock. It looks clean, runs great, and has a lot of great little features that just make the phone feel next-gen. I've decided to completely utilize the google ecosystem, and it all works together so seamlessly. Even though the 5X is middle of the pack, hardware-wise, it feels premium and futuristic because of the operating system. For this reason alone, I would recommend getting a nexus.**Google Fi**I switched to Fi from Verizon to get the 5X, not because I had had a bad experience with Verizon. What I like about Fi is the transparency and ease of use. Making the switch was easy, and it's super simple and straightforward to adjust my plan. * *Pricing*: Google Fi's monthly rate is $20 base, $10 per gb of data, and then whatever you are paying if you finance your phone. If you go over your data limit they'll simply charge an extra $10, and they'll refund you for data that you don't use. There's no contract, and the price for my 5X was the exact same whether I paid for it all upfront or financed it over 24 months. I don't feel like they're trying to screw me with the fine print, which sets Fi way ahead of most cellular companies. Because I know that I can get a refund at the end of the month, I've actually become very good at managing my data. If I wanted to go nuts, however, it's good to know that I wouldn't get charged an insane rate because I went over my limit. * *Connectivity*: My coverage has been good - I believe that Fi uses the T-Mobile and Sprint networks, and I haven't noticed much change in coverage compared Verizon. Fi performs worse in my local grocery store, but I swear that place lines their ceiling with reception-blocking lead. **Overall**Great phone. You'll find phones with better hardware and construction, but I think that the Marshmellow experience is outstanding. Everything runs smoothly, is well integrated, and feels next-gen. I love the finger-print scanner, it's one of the few features offered by this generation of phones that significantly enhances the user experience (I know other phones have had it, but the 5X does it so much better). Google Fi is great, and I really like their business model. I'd highly recommend the 5X and Google Fi. edit: Provided more details for Google Fi's pricing plan "
"Positive","My take on the Pixel 3 vs iPhone Xs.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","Is Android killing it's own momentum?.I wanted to make this post because I wanted a forum for discussion to see what everyone's thoughts were on the current state of things. For a while it appeared that Android was on the rise even in the high end phone department, Google was putting out high quality devices at an affordable price (Nexus 6P) which a unique design and the Google ecosystem has never been stronger.  Then came the announcement with Allo and Duo along with the coming Pixel phones which took the hype train to full speed along with the launch of the ever impressing Note 7. Then it all stopped. The Note 7 launch ended up being a major disaster with the battery issue, Allo came out as another gimmick and wasn't the iMessage we had hoped for, and then the Pixel phones basically shit on everyone with the absolutely stale/boring design with a high price point all while the Apple unveiled its new A10 Fusion chip. Not to place the blame solely on Samsung and Google's shortcomings but Qualcomm has continued to show us just how incompetent and how shitty their chips are. They know they have had a lock on the mobile chip department and the past few chipsets have been disappointments, especially comparing the 821 snapdragon to the A10 Fusion. Even Samsung manufactured their own Exynos chip that outperforms the snapdragon. I feel like we had so much momentum and suddenly it's all come to a stop, I was hoping for the Pixel phone to be something great and stick to the same price point of the Nexus phones, I was hoping to Allo and Duo to really unite all the separated SMS options, and I hope that Chrome OS would take off and we would start seeing developer options as well as the standard inexpensive consumer options.There's are just my thoughts, I'm curious to see how other people are feeling and maybe see if there's opinions or facts out there that can change my mind on some things."
"Positive","Pixel vs Samsung (OneUI) features - Trying to make a list.I'm trying to make a list of what you gain or lose in Samsung's environment versus Google's. This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me / Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?"
"Positive","I'm not tired of Android, but I'm tired of Google neglecting Android.After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves."
"Positive","iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, Note 8...a poor man's review.I am not a rich man. I can't just go out and buy a new piece of tech every day like all of my favorite YouTubers. There has to be research involved...I need to know what I'm buying will keep me happy for longer than the 14 day return period. So with 3 top-end phones in my crosshairs, the iPhone X, the Pixel 2XL and the Note 8, I drudged through pages and pages of reddit reviews, watched hours of video commentary and came to one conclusion: I have no idea what phone to buy, so why not try out all 3. Since I'm a man of limited means, I'd have to try them out one at a time. I started the upgrade process on my account, and set my sights on the first prize, the iPhone X.  X-tra screen, X-tra pricey...The iPhone X is arguably the most beautiful slab of glass and stainless steel I've ever held in my hands. The weight of the phone lets you know you've spent money on something well built. I felt like when I had this thing out showing it off, I was the center of attention...usually because I was. It is a near perfect monument of what the path to the perfect iPhone has been for Apple. The screen alone almost makes the phone worth it, with its vivid, punchy colors and amazing brightness. The screen almost looks TOO good. Like you can reach in and touch the icons. The notch, while noticeable for about 3 minutes, just melts away. I only noticed it when a video zoomed in past its pillar boxes. Even then, the notch didn't seem to upset me. What did upset me was learning the gestures. Some of them make sense, swiping up from the bottom to close an app for instance. But others, like getting to the background apps, felt slow and clunky. And getting to the control center should be easier than it is. It's not a one handed operation, but I really feel it should be! Sure, if you have big hands like I do, you can stretch your thumb out. But if you have small hands, it's not going to be easy. What made iOS great in the past was its simplicity and intuitiveness. All of that seems to have been forgotten with the X and iOS 11. What has stayed simple though, is Apple's top notch bio metrics.FaceID sounds like a bigger gimmick than square hamburger patties at Wendy's. I mean, Android has had this for years, right? Wrong, FaceID was easy to set up and quick to unlock. The amazing subtle features that come with FaceID like hiding notifications on the lock screen until the phone recognizes you is just amazing. I liked that I didn't have to position my face in some weird pose or angle for it to work, either. It just worked and that's what Apple people know and love. Animoji's...while an even bigger gimmick, were fun to play around with and really showcases what that front camera is capable of. Speaking of Cameras, both cameras did great, the pics looked decently colored and I really love iOS's live photos with 3D touch. It's about the only thing I used 3D touch for and it's done well. The video recording was very well done, with 4k @ 60FPS being its biggest highlight. The only thing I thought that wasn't well done was the OIS...to be honest, I had to double check to make sure the phone HAD OIS because it didn't feel like it. Hopefully that gets fixed in a software update. Overall though, the cameras can hold their own with the best that Android has to offer. However, after using the phone for a little bit, I really felt cheated. I was not seeing the smooth as silk iOS I had been told of for many years. I was not getting top of the line battery life from a $1100+ phone. And as an android user for the last 6 years, things just felt clunky navigating around the OS. I missed things I've taken for granted for years like my notifications with LEDs, AOD, and setting my own default apps. Some of these things I could get adjusted to and I realize iOS 11 is going through a rough patch. But, all in all, it just wasn't feeling like I could justify purchasing the X and telling myself to adapt to my phone instead of my phone adapting to me.Let's go back to the Android basics, 2 XL style...Being on AT&T, I couldn't just go into the store and subsidize a Pixel 2 XL. That alone bugs me. I HATE carrier exclusive phones. Yes, I know, I can buy the phone direct from Google and that's good. But there's something nice about going to a carrier store, picking up the phone you want right there and walking out paying only sales tax (with a big bill later). Lucky for me, one of my friends owns a shiney new Pixel 2 XL and let me play with it for a day. Holy bananas, this phone is snappy...no, snappy isn't good enough. It's, it's...Google needs to invent a new word for how fast this phone feels. I've been on the Samsung train for most of my Android life, with the One+one and the Nexus 6 being the only two exceptions. I honestly thought that the whole skipping frames and sluggishness you read about on the ""I hate Samsung"" train that is r/Android was a bunch of nonsense. Even my S7Edge felt fine to me. No real slowdowns or anything. Nope... I was wrong. WAAAAAY wrong. The Pixel 2 XL felt like I had stepped out of a Toyota Corolla and into a Ferrari. My friend laughed as I scrolled through the app drawer for minutes just saying ""it's sooo smooth!""  From one Samsung fanboy to the rest of you out there, your phone is slow, you just don't realize it. The camera was the other area this phone just steps out into its own. I could not get it to take a bad photo to save my life. Putting it against my other co-workers iPhone 8, she was even blown away by how the photos looked just like real life. I briefly tried out the video functionality and cannot figure out how this camera manages to make better videos than phones with dual lens setups and OIS on everything except the user itself. My only complaint about the camera was I didn't have a lot of shooting mode options. Everything was very basic, with just a couple of modes. Google keeping it simple for the user definitely works for a lot of people, but I do like having options like a manual mode.The Pixel 2's biggest controversy since its release is its less than stellar screen. Once again, coming from Samsung and even playing with the iPhone X, I think I'm a pretty good judge  when it comes to OLED displays. I have almost nothing bad to say about the 2 XL's display. The blueshift on the phone I tested didn't stand out to me as anything bad and really felt overblown especially when looking at other OLEDs. I checked for light bleed and didn't see any. And while my friend's 2 XL is only a week old, I didn't see any burn in or image retention, but he does keep the brightness in check so as to not suffer the wrath of the burn in gods.  Speaking of brightness, this seems to be my only gripe with the screen. At max brightness, it just barely seemed to hang in there especially in direct sunlight. While I could see what was on screen, dark colors just merged together and details can't stand out. Out of the 3 phones I tested, this was by far the darkest screen. Its great for indoors, but I wasn't overly thrilled taking it outside.   Now, I fully admit I don't get the religious ""Pure Android"" or nothing attitude I see on Reddit. I think OEM skins aren't just nice, but vital to forcing Google to incorporate the best of each skin into new iterations of Android. AOD, Multi-app display and a ton of other features in Android are thanks to LG, Samsung and all the others out there pushing the limits of their vision of Android.  That being said, simple Android is pretty easy to use and I'd even argue maybe even easier to use than iOS lately. After tinkering with the 2 XL, I can definitely see the appeal, but I do and always will love feature rich skins that provide users with an even more engrossing and productive experience. A noteworthy experience, but can it last?My final phone tested was the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This phone is so big, I had to get permits from the city just to let me put it in my house! I kid, but while expensive, the Note 8 will at least leave you with the feeling you got a LOT for your money. And you really do, too! That pen just keeps getting smarter every iteration of the Note line. With it being able to do text translations and live messaging, it's a g̶i̶m̶m̶i̶c̶k̶ feature that I kept finding myself going back to. I was looking for excuses to pull out the pen and do new things on the screen...that gorgeous, beautiful screen. Picasso once said ""Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun."" Samsung has managed to create not another copy of an OLED display, but ""THE"" OLED display for others to copy. What the Note 8 lacks in fluidity (and it does), it makes up for in the most stunning display and feature rich experience in all of the 3 phones I tested. From app pairing, to cutting out sections of the screen, drawing notes and then texting them faster than it took for me to write this sentence, the Note 8 has abilities that would make a swiss army knife blush. I was finding new things to do with the phone every time I picked it up. It's almost overwhelming! And therein lies the problem with Samsung vs. Android purists. Samsung weighs itself down with a constant influx of features at the expense of ram and processing power. THANKFULLY, I'm happy to say that the Note 8 experience was a smooth one. Not NEARLY as smooth as the Pixel 2 XL, but Samsung has made ungodly strides in improving performance and it shows in the Note 8. That's not to say there weren't the occasional frame drop here and there, now that I know what to look for with my Pixel experience. I can hear what you're thinking, ""Smooth now, but give it a month or two..."" and I would agree with you. My Galaxy S6+ was probably the worst offender in recent memory. However, I was able to compare the new Note 8 in my hand to another coworker's Note 8 they've had since launch. Everything seemed to be identical in terms of smoothness and the benchmarks were practically the same. I tried to break both phones, bogging them down with running apps, music and video. But to my surprise, both phones held steady. What didn't hold steady was the battery life. I found it to be just barely ok. I think that with quick charge, we are becoming accustomed to fast charging top offs at the expense of sub par battery life. Samsung really needs to address this in the next Note phone because a productivity phone that you use during the work day SHOULD be able to get you through the work day without the feeling of panic by 2 PM. I hope Samsung shakes off the PTSD they gained from the Note 7 disaster. We need battery innovation and the Note 8 is a great example of why. Camera wise, the Note 8 took great photos for a normal guy like myself. But the iPhone X did a  better job and the 2 XL blew both of them out of the water. The one area I felt the Note 8 shined over the other 2 was in video recording. The image stabilization was excellent on the Note as well as the recorded sound quality! While the iPhone X's recorded sound was very quiet and the 2 XL's was very tinny, the Note 8 had a very good balance of audio quality and ambient noise reduction. This surprised me since I didn't think Samsung cared about sound because the Note comes with a single bottom firing speaker...it’s 2017 Samsung, stereo speakers are a thing! I’m sorry for yelling, Samsung...please don’t kill off the headphone jack. Ok, Ok...TLDR, what did I pick? While beautiful, I couldn't get myself used to the Apple ecosystem so the X was out. The 2 XL can't be purchased/subsidized through AT&T's Next program and I refuse to switch to Verizon so that was out. Which leaves me with the Note 8. I loved all three phones for plenty of reasons and you CAN'T go wrong with any of them. The iPhone X is a beautiful...BEAUTIFUL work of art, the Pixel 2 XL is a purist dream come true that is faster than any phone I've ever played with and the Note 8 is a treasure trove of features and a display that will melt your eyes with its beauty.  I count myself lucky to live in an age of these beautiful devices and am fortunate to be able to own one!

"Positive","Forever Android user trying out IPhone XS Max.I'm an android fanboy for the most part. I have always owned an android phone (since the droid 1). The device i switched from was a Pixel 2 XL , so most of my comparisons will be against that. I decided to give Iphone a try since i personally never have (i didn't switch because i dislike android, i still love android, but wanted to try something different). I did a similar post on /r/apple, and wanted to share my thoughts here as well (a little more detailed since i have more time to play around)Here are some thoughts:The Good:**Apps**: App optimization on iOS is fantastic. The apps feel smoother, and have a much more consistent design language. Menu locations and navigation make sense, and everything is reflective of the OS as a whole. This was definitely the biggest plus moving from android.**Hardware**: This phone *feels* like it's a thousand bucks. The heft, the feel in hand, the steel feels amazing when holding it. The display is fantastic. Up there (if not better) than the samsung counterparts. Speakers are also loud and fantastic (although the pixel 2xl is quite good too).EDIT: Jesus fuck people, i know that these phones have the samsung panel (albeit for the XS they announced some of their stock will be from LG), but their calibrations are certainly different. I personally am more pleased with the iphone XS display than the galaxy s9. I haven't seen the note 9 in person so can't comment on that.**Gestures**: I'm still getting used to them, but gestures are great so far on iOS. Everything feels quick and smooth, and a lot of them are common sense. I tried the android gestures out on my pixel and it just didn't feel nearly as natural. The Meh:**FaceID**: I honestly don't get it. People keep telling me it's fast and just as convenient as a fingerprint sensor, but to me they're just flat out wrong. After having used it for a couple days (reset it at one point), it's just not as fast as i want it to be. I'm not an average person, so the split second that i have to wait for faceid to work frustrates the hell out of me, especially since on my pixel i would unlock the phone *as* i pulled it out of my pocket so it was ready to be looked at. Also, faceid in the dark (particularly when i wake up and want to check my notifications) is super hit or miss for me. **Camera**: Okay, let me start by saying that i am NOT a camera guy. I don't know what makes a camera good, other then my own opinion of how a picture comes out. With taht said, the camera on this phone is great. Probably one of the best, but to me it lags behind my Pixel 2 XL (which i think is still the best smartphone camera). The pictures feel a bit more washed out and the detail isn't there like on my 2 XL (although the 2 XL sometimes oversaturates and makes things a bit more colorful than they actually are). THe camera is excellent for what it is, but i was expecting more given the year separation between it and the pixel 2.  I will say though that portrait mode is greatt on this and definitely better than the pixel (although tbh i barely use portrait so it doesn't make a huge difference to me)The Bad:**Notifications**: Notifications on apple have certainly gotten better, but they still don't come close to android imo. Android is built around notifications, so i rely on them *heavily*, so apple being a step below android when it comes to this is a bit of a tough pill to swallow for me. I dislike the little info i can see of the notification when i tap my phone (vs the level of detail android provides depending on the app). I also miss being able to swipe notifications (i dislike having to press a button personally/ swiping twice). **Back Button**: I NEVER thought i'd miss the android back button. It's inconsitent across apps, and sometimes doesn't work the way you want it to. Even with that, it's still way easier and intuitive than the swipe back on ios (or pressing the top left back button). THe swipe sometimes takes 2 or 3 times to get right, and the top left back button is just way too far away to use consistently. ~~**Volume**: I learned the hardway that the system volume on the IPhone is ALSO the volume for the alarm. I was used to having separate volume on android (media, phone, alarm, ring). I ALWAYS kept alarm at the highest volume while i messed around with the others to my liking depending on the situation. I missed my alarm the first 2 mornings i had the iphone, and even now i can't get the settings to my liking like i did on android.~~EDIT: I decided to remove this is a negative because a ton of people have responded with tips on how to get around this. I went ahead and tried it out and it gave me the desired effect. I still prefer the android customization to volume, but since this fix gave me what i wanted i figured i should remove it from negatives.**No Fingerprint Sensor**:  EVen if faceid was perfect, i'd still miss the fingerprint sensor. The swipe down for notifications, the fact that the fingerprint sensor OPENS the phone rather then just unlocks it are features thoroughly missed.Overall, i miss android. Other then app optimization/design on iOS, i think android is superior in every way. The only reason i wanted to switch is becasue i really enjoy the apple ecosystem (i have a macbook and an ipad pro and probably plan to get a series 4 watch if i stick with the iphone). I'm going to give it another week before fully deciding if i want to keep it, but so far im not super impressed. Also, even though i already said this, it needs to be said again, the Pixel 2 XL camera is fucking god tier."
"Positive","Why I Love my Pixel Slate: A Brief 2020 Review Vs the Competition (iPad, Galaxy Tab, Surface).Okay this isn't that brief...sorry. See TL;DR at the bottom.I was in the market for a new tablet or tablet-like 2 in 1 device that I can use for both web browsing and media consumption as a tablet, and as a competent productivity device, eg multitasking apps, and windows, note taking, emails, document writing, and web apps for my job etc. nothing crazy intensive so no content creation, art, programming etc.My needs were:* Preferably at least 6GB of RAM* Up to date processor that can handle multitasking* Minimum 1440p display* Keyboard included w/trackpad* Native mouse/trackpad support* External device ready capability* Proper file management* Preferably around 10 inches* Headphone jack* Price Range <$500As an Android fan, it was pretty disappointing to see the limited amount of android tablets that could even fit \*most\* of that bill, which lead me to a pretty difficult decision to make for my needs.Here is a short review of each, *compared to the Pixel Slate,* of why I chose not to buy it.Surface Go* I like the size, love the surface keyboard, and running full windows means native x86 app support.But at this price (at the time) it only opened me up to 4GB of ram, which is just not a great experience on Windows.* Windows is simply \*not\* a proper tablet UI...at all - It's a laptop first and foremost   * Touch response feels slow, sometimes requiring double taps to confirm, the touch keyboard is unresponsive and really laggy, often doesn’t automatically open when clicking on text boxes/search bars, very few optimized apps for tablet use, barebones gestures, etc.Samsung Tab S5e* The 10 inch, AMOLED display with Dolby Atmos speakers would makes this a great media consumption device.  Samsung DEX mode makes productivity the best Android tablets have seen so far* But only 2 years of support, no headphone jack, a slow 6 series Qualcomm processer and only 4gb of RAM and running mobile browsers only makes the $500 price tag seem like a joke.iPad Pro 2017 10.5* Several years of support, 120hz display, without a doubt the most powerful device here.* Lack of proper trackpad/mouse support - the accessibility feature doesn't fit the bill. But ultimately iOS and the Apple ecosystem led me to not buy this, which I almost did.  I have absolutely \*no desire\* to mess with iOS and its apps that you’re forced to use. No set-default browser/app option, using google services is more cumbersome, multitasking isn’t as good as ChromeOS, Windows, and in \*some ways\* DEX mode on Android, watered down adblock and extension support, not full desktop browser etc.This brings me to the Pixel SlateWe all know this thing was a joke at launch, too expensive, stupid slow Celeron processor, and ChromeOS was a mess. These things have all been worked out a year later, and I love it. I bought the Core m3 version on black friday for $450 that included the keyboard and pen.The build quality, high resolution display, excellent battery life, great keyboard/trackpad, and dual front facing speakers make it a joy to use. The Core m3 processor and 8GB of ram in the base model has been plenty for me.As for the software, ChromeOS has seen *a ton* of improvement since it released. No bugs, glitches, lag, etc. Not quite as smooth as the others in some cases here and there, but mostly great. The tablet mode is familiar, gestures work great, and Android Apps, at least the ones I use, work perfectly well.Full-desktop browser support on ChromeOS makes it so that you can actually use this machine for work (depending on your needs of course) and take advantage of proper plug-in support and adblocks. Plus, its supported for another 5 years.Only thing i'm not a fan of is that there is no headphone jack, something I \*really\* had to swallow, the keyboard hinge could be better, and I wish there was an 11 inch version as 12 is a bit too big as a tablet, but something you can get used to.TL;DRAll of these tablets have their use cases, but for me the Slate in 2020 feels like that perfect hybrid tablet device many people are always looking for. It's a great tablet with Android apps, smooth gestures, awesome screen and battery. But it also has a proper file manager, multi-display support, native mouse/trackpad support, and desktop browser which makes it a really competent work device too.I highly recommend looking into one if you're in the same situation I was.Let me know your thoughts or if you have questions"
"Positive","My take on the Pixel 3 vs iPhone Xs.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","When talking iOS vs Android... I'm a hardcore Android fan, but are none of you seriously freaked out by Google's user data mining??.I've been a long-time android fan since 2011, never owned an iPhone, every phone I ever bought was an Android phone.&#x200B;Than my company gave me an iPhone SE as my work phone, and at first I was like yeah whatever, but after using this tiny-screened 1gb RAM piece of ""ancient"" tech for a few weeks I started to get the charm of Apple. &#x200B;Now I know many people, especially in the tech community say they are overpriced, Siri sucks, Apple locks you into its ecosystem etc. etc. but think about it, maybe they do charge more than they need to (probably), but Apple's take on user privacy is the best in the business AFAIK, you do not feel like a product when using an Apple device. Google charges you out the nose for a Pixel AND harvests your data like there's no tomorrow (thousands of  location reports/day from android to google and that's a fact, the reasons Google assistant is so good is cause of that Data mining, same reason Siri isn't that smart).&#x200B;Google locks you into it's own ecosystem just as much if not more than Apple. Name the last time you searched for something on the internet using anything but Google, and don't act like there's a wealth of choiice to choose from. Google is after money just as much as Apple, they're just less upfront about it, and I do not like that one bit.&#x200B;**The point of this post basically is why the hell do we praise Google so much???? I'm not saying throw out your Android phone and spend 1.5k on an iPhone, but to be honest if that 1.5k helps me know Apple doesn't treat me like a product that produces data, maybe it's not that high a price to pay.**&#x200B;What do you peeps think?"

Build quality, battery life and performance seem to be especially good."
"Positive","I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro after months of use..Hey guys,Pixel phones have been some of my favourite phones over the past years. I’ve had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship that’s come out. While the Pixel 5 was a really good phone overall, I wished for a more premium phone from Google as it missed some key features like the zoom camera, better haptic motor, and speakers. When Google announced the Pixel 6 lineup, I was cautiously optimistic. On paper, the phones seemed to be the best Pixels ever. So, I went ahead and got both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. Here are my thoughts on the phones after using them for about 5 months.**Design and Build Quality**I think Google got a lot right with the design and build quality of the phones. Both phones feel premium in hand. While it was great to have a metal back in the Pixel 5, the plastic coating made it feel like a budget phone last year. I also like that we got to have more colour options this year.While Google got a lot right this year, they weren’t able to hit a home run on everything. Both phones are quite big and somewhat heavy. I wish Google created a smaller model as using the phones with one hand is quite challenging. I’m also not the biggest fan of the glossy back. I think the frosted white from the Pixel 4/XL was the best feeling material Google had and I wish they did something similar this time around.On the bright side, Google used a much higher quality haptic motor this time. Both phones have some of the best haptics on Android devices. Also, the speakers are way better this year. The sound quality is pretty nice and I had no issues with calls or playing media during my time with the phones.**Performance and Battery Life**Pixel phones are known for their buttery smooth performance and clean UI. Even the Pixel 5 was able to be incredibly smooth with mid-range specs. So, it was not surprising to see the Pixel 6 perform like a true flagship. Everything is buttery smooth here and I noticed some processor intensive tasks to be a lot faster on the Pixel 6 vs the Pixel 5. For example, apps install much quicker on the Pixel 6 compared to the Pixel 5.I don’t game on my phones, but for everything I used the phones for, the Pixels delivered some of the fastest Android experience I’ve had.Battery life has been pretty decent in my experience. Both phones easily got me through an entire day. I found the Pixel 6 battery to be slightly better than the Pro. This could be due to the difference in antennas. Both phones would typically have over 30% by the end of the day. While this isn’t as good as the iPhone 13 Pro as I typically have around 40%-50% battery left by the end of the day, I’m pretty comfortable with the Pixel 6’s longevity throughout the day.**Screen and Fingerprint Sensor**The Pixel 6 has a 90hz flat screen and the Pixel 6 Pro has a 120hz curved screen. To be honest, both feel just as smooth. It’s very hard to tell the difference between 90hz and 120hz. But compared to 60hz, both phones feel incredibly smooth. Also, both screens get bright enough for easy day time viewing, so no concerns there.I personally prefer the flat screen of the Pixel 6. The curved screen, while it looks more ""premium"" doesn’t offer the same user experience as the corners are desaturated and there are some accidental touches here and there.The fingerprint sensor on the phone is absolute trash. This is one of the worst fingerprint sensors I’ve ever used. It has gotten better with updates, but it still misses like 50% of the time when my hands are very dry. It's particularly bad outdoors for some reason. I’ve tried scanning my fingers multiple times, but that still doesn’t fix the issue. This is almost a dealbreaker as this is one of the only biometric unlock methods and Google doesn’t offer face unlock. I really miss the rear fingerprint sensor from the Pixel 5. **Software Experience**I have mixed feelings about the software. Performance wise, the phone absolutely flies and offers some of the best Android experience. Even comparing to new flagships like the S22 Ultra, I feel the Pixel is smoother in day-to-day use. However, I feel Google is taking a step back with Android 12. While it looks prettier than older releases, usability has gotten worse. For example, there’s no more wifi toggle. You have to go to internet and then change your wifi. You can’t get rid of the at a glance widget on the home screen, which I don’t understand. The only way you can have a clean home screen is through a third party launcher, but then the animations aren’t as smooth when you’re multi-tasking unless you root the phone. Also, not sure if this is a widespread issue, but I found notifications on the Pixel 6 to be slower than the iPhone 13. Emails notifications in particular took a minute or two longer than iPhones to show up.On the other hand, there’s a lot of stuff to love. Google is offering 5 years of security updates, which is way better than most Android phone makers. Call screening is still one of my favourite features and I wish more phones had something like this. I also really like the new widgets you get with Android 12. They really add to the fun vibe Google is trying to create with Android 12.Also, Pixel 6 has some of the best voice recognition I’ve experienced with a phone. The phone instantly recognizes everything I say. It really makes you feel like you’re living in the future.I hope Google starts to offer a mode similar to Dex on the Pixels. As phones get more powerful, it’ll be great to expand the ways we use our phones.**Camera**I have mixed feelings here as well. Google was the king of smartphone photography for at least 3 years and it was one of the main reasons I used Pixel as my daily driver. This is also the reason I started [ShotbyPixel](https://instagram.com/shotbypixel) years ago. This year, I was very excited about the cameras as Google finally changed the sensors and offered more than 2 cameras. On paper, Google was set to be the camera champ once again, but reality ended up being quite different.The ultra wide angle camera isn’t wide enough. The quality is quite average and the shots I got weren’t as nice as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S21/S22 Ultra. The main camera took stunning pictures most of the time, but it also missed more than previous Pixels. Also, I feel Google went overboard with the processing. Photos have a very digital overprocessed look to them at times, which I’m not a big fan of. On the bright side, the bigger sensor gets some nice shallow depth of field. It’s good for closeups, but not great when taking photos of documents as the camera isn’t able to focus on entire documents.The selfie camera is also quite average. I like that it’s wide, but I wasn’t a big fan of the end result.The telephoto camera surprised me in a good way. I love the shots that I was able to get from the camera. The 4x telephoto really lets you [frame photos in a way most phones don’t](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbn7dgl4nZ/). Also, the short minimum focusing distance almost makes this a macro camera as well. While I don’t think most people should spend the extra money to get the Pro for the telephoto camera, it’s worth the investment if you take a lot of photos.**Final Thoughts**I think Google got a lot right this year with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Both phones look and feel great, and offer exceptional performance and software experience. Plus the price of the regular 6 makes it very easy to recommend to most people who want an iPhone like experience on Android. I hope Google continues to invest in the Pixel ecosystem. The phone has a lot of potential, but the lack of accessories such as a Pixel watch really work against it when compared to Samsung or Apple phones. If Google is able to improve some of the software issues and fix the fingerprint sensor, the next Pixel has a serious shot at being the best Android phone. For now, I think the Samsung S series still provide a better overall experience due to the ecosystem and features."
"Positive","I'm not tired of Android, but I'm tired of Google neglecting Android.After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):    - HTC Evo 4G    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)    - HTC Evo 3D    - Google Nexus S    - Google Galaxy Nexus    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S4    - HTC One X (briefly)    - Motorola Moto X (original)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4    - Google Nexus 6    - Motorola Moto X 2015    - Google Nexus 6P    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)    About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  ---------------------------------The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. - One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.---------------------------------But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriersSo I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).Does anyone else feel similar?------------------------------------------------**Edit:** I also want to add the random A/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don't) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves."

Also, both screens get bright enough for easy day time viewing, so no concerns there.I personally prefer the flat screen of the Pixel 6. The curved screen, while it looks more ""premium"" doesn’t offer the same user experience as the corners are desaturated and there are some accidental touches here and there.The fingerprint sensor on the phone is absolute trash. This is one of the worst fingerprint sensors I’ve ever used. It has gotten better with updates, but it still misses like 50% of the time when my hands are very dry. It's particularly bad outdoors for some reason. I’ve tried scanning my fingers multiple times, but that still doesn’t fix the issue. This is almost a dealbreaker as this is one of the only biometric unlock methods and Google doesn’t offer face unlock. I really miss the rear fingerprint sensor from the Pixel 5. **Software Experience**I have mixed feelings about the software. Performance wise, the phone absolutely flies and offers some of the best Android experience. Even comparing to new flagships like the S22 Ultra, I feel the Pixel is smoother in day-to-day use. However, I feel Google is taking a step back with Android 12. While it looks prettier than older releases, usability has gotten worse. For example, there’s no more wifi toggle. You have to go to internet and then change your wifi. You can’t get rid of the at a glance widget on the home screen, which I don’t understand. The only way you can have a clean home screen is through a third party launcher, but then the animations aren’t as smooth when you’re multi-tasking unless you root the phone. Also, not sure if this is a widespread issue, but I found notifications on the Pixel 6 to be slower than the iPhone 13. Emails notifications in particular took a minute or two longer than iPhones to show up.On the other hand, there’s a lot of stuff to love. Google is offering 5 years of security updates, which is way better than most Android phone makers. Call screening is still one of my favourite features and I wish more phones had something like this. I also really like the new widgets you get with Android 12. They really add to the fun vibe Google is trying to create with Android 12.Also, Pixel 6 has some of the best voice recognition I’ve experienced with a phone. The phone instantly recognizes everything I say. It really makes you feel like you’re living in the future.I hope Google starts to offer a mode similar to Dex on the Pixels. As phones get more powerful, it’ll be great to expand the ways we use our phones.**Camera**I have mixed feelings here as well. Google was the king of smartphone photography for at least 3 years and it was one of the main reasons I used Pixel as my daily driver. This is also the reason I started [ShotbyPixel](https://instagram.com/shotbypixel) years ago. This year, I was very excited about the cameras as Google finally changed the sensors and offered more than 2 cameras. On paper, Google was set to be the camera champ once again, but reality ended up being quite different.The ultra wide angle camera isn’t wide enough. The quality is quite average and the shots I got weren’t as nice as the iPhone 13 Pro or Samsung S21/S22 Ultra. The main camera took stunning pictures most of the time, but it also missed more than previous Pixels. Also, I feel Google went overboard with the processing. Photos have a very digital overprocessed look to them at times, which I’m not a big fan of. On the bright side, the bigger sensor gets some nice shallow depth of field. It’s good for closeups, but not great when taking photos of documents as the camera isn’t able to focus on entire documents.The selfie camera is also quite average. I like that it’s wide, but I wasn’t a big fan of the end result.The telephoto camera surprised me in a good way. I love the shots that I was able to get from the camera. The 4x telephoto really lets you [frame photos in a way most phones don’t](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXbn7dgl4nZ/). Also, the short minimum focusing distance almost makes this a macro camera as well. While I don’t think most people should spend the extra money to get the Pro for the telephoto camera, it’s worth the investment if you take a lot of photos.**Final Thoughts**I think Google got a lot right this year with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Both phones look and feel great, and offer exceptional performance and software experience. Plus the price of the regular 6 makes it very easy to recommend to most people who want an iPhone like experience on Android. I hope Google continues to invest in the Pixel ecosystem. The phone has a lot of potential, but the lack of accessories such as a Pixel watch really work against it when compared to Samsung or Apple phones. If Google is able to improve some of the software issues and fix the fingerprint sensor, the next Pixel has a serious shot at being the best Android phone. For now, I think the Samsung S series still provide a better overall experience due to the ecosystem and features."
"Positive","My Android to iOS Story.*You can say this post was was inspired by the post on the front page, but the truth is I always wanted to make this post months ago. This is my chance.* How? How could I change from the freedom of Android to the restricted nature that is known as iOS. I bet that's what you're asking yourself. To know my reason, I need to tell my story. Allow me to take you back to much simpler times. Android was ugly and Windows phone was actually a thing. It was September of 2014 and Nexus fever was in everyone's heart and mind. As a newcomer to /r/android, I found myself in the hype bandwagon with all the Android diehards. Slighted by my crappy LG Optimus L9 (A shitty t-mobile carrier exclusive with less than 1.8 gbs of usable space), what I wanted was the real Android experience. I refused to give into Apple's offering. Running on the heels of the very successful Nexus 5, the Nexus 6 was surely going to impress. Right? Expectations and hype continued to rise as I was padding my wallet for Google's next offering. It was then Shamu was unveiled and out of the ocean blue came it's premium price.Hysteria would be the word to describe it. Anger and vitriol fueled countless threads as seething fingers pounded away at keyboards, myself included. Since I was merely a college student at the time (still am), I had no choice but to go for a more budget friendly option. This was around the time One Plus was invite only, and invites were hard to come by. [Most people fought for invites by pressing away at that F5 key.](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/2ili8a/invite_giveaway_megathread/) In today's market $500 could get you an amazing Android phone, but back then, it wasn't looking so lively. But, there was one phone that caught my eye and it was that phone that became my first, real Android phone. Enter: Moto X 2014 *Pure Edition*. Most /r/android members remember this phone, but most don't remember the ""Pure Edition"". If I could describe this phone, it would be like this. If shamu was the nexus 6, then the Moto X 2014 Pure Edition was the nexus 6 mini edition. Rumor had it [whoever was supposed to make Nexus 6 backed out, so Motorola's premium device 'Moto S' was billed as the Nexus 6](http://dailysunknoxville.com/google-nexus-6-an-unexpected-success/920012825). Whatever reason it was, I believe I had the nexus 6 mini edition. And it was glorious. As I had the pure edition, it was bloat free and was a buttery experience. After signing up for Motorola's beta, I got Lolipop before any other phone, including the Nexus 5! [(And of course a few other people...)](https://redd.it/2m3bue). I loved my phone for the first time and I'll never forget it.Of course, that would last all of two months until I realized how powerful Apple's hold was on the US was, or atleast among college kids in the in the US. iMessage became my enemy as it had excluded me out of many conversations. I know what you're saying: ""They're not your real friends...they're shitty people...find new people to hang out with"". How do I know this? It's because its my most [controversial post I ever made on this site](https://redd.it/2u1q6q). ([A news outlet even made a clickbait out of it.](http://bgr.com/2015/01/29/imessage-vs-android/))I soon realized it was a first world problem only confined to people like me, who were in college and in the states. iMessage had such a stronghold on this demographic, but apparently not everyone. Was this a reason why I switched? No. This was a problem I faced two years ago, and I obviously I didn't switch. Of course I would face this problem here and there, but of course I compensated through the months. Now a days, snapchat group messages are a thing but this is neither here nor there. It was a year later after I initially bought my ""first real Android phone"" that Marshmallow came out. And I was ecstatic for my new OS update. I was in for a rude awakening. If you didn't know, Motorola at this point was sold by Google to Lenovo. At this point, Lenovo had a hands off approach, but that was no longer the case. For whatever reason, I wouldn't get Marshmallow for a few months. So much so for getting my updates fast, right? But truth be told, I was one of the lucky ones. [The carrier variants of my device wouldn't even be getting an update to the sweetest OS.](http://www.ubergizmo.com/2015/10/att-verizon-moto-x-2014-no-android-6-0/)This theme would carry on for quite some time. What I loved about my phone originally, was all but gone. Fast updates, Security updates, that butteryness, all but gone. It was still a great device, but it was all but forsaken for newer devices. **Here was where irony lied: Everything I wanted perfectly described the iPhone.**Woah! I know what you're thinking. The nexus devices! The pixel! Get the latest offering from google and you'll get all of that and a great device.[While I might not totally agree with that sentiment](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/20/lawsuit-filed-against-google-and-huawei-over-nexus-6p-early-shutdown-issue-and-bootlooping/), you would totally be right (idk about the 5x though...). But here's another problem with the Android ecosystem that I might think is a problem. The fragmentation.I am not developer, so perhaps I should be the last person to comment on this, but with so many devices, an app developer has to make an app for so many devices spread out on different OS's. While I know google makes it easy to do that, fragmentation is still a problem. But I feel as if that is more of a problem for a developer than the end user. That's what I thought until I used my iPhone 6s+. I have never used a phone so buttery, it is insane how buttery it is. And the amount of optimization an app has on an ios device is leagues beyond most Android devices. This is probably the biggest benefit Apple has by making the OS so closed off.But, what do I know, I'm an armchair critic. Either way, after two years I finally took the plunge into iOS. And how do I feel about it? It's simple: I hate that I love it. It just works. I know it's cliche, but damn it just does. I'm not some mindless apple fanboy that I used to make fun of...this thing is pretty good. Do I miss Android? Hell yeah I do. I do miss some of the freedom I had with Android. Oh, and the notifications are leagues better on Android. I feel like I took 10 steps back with iOS notifications. (I also miss Reddit sync...it's not so hot on iOS and Reddit's app is no where near feature rich).What did I do with my previous device? I kept it. I use it for running. My Moto X is now a glorified MP3 player. I also tinkered with it also; throwing on the latest version of Linage OS to get Nougat. But, will I ever come back to Android? Probably...my plan is to come back for the Pixel 3. I honestly believe google will have their shit in order by then, then again I might be wrong. (I believed I would be buying a project Ara phone this year, but look how that turned out.)And that's my tale.They each have their pros and cons at the end of the day, so I'll probably be switching back and forth because why the hell not. Hopefully you can get something out of this. :)"
"Positive","Opinion: Google is after the same customers that made Apple wealthy. Those who want great working phones, an ecosystem of familiarity (Google), and an exceptional camera.In simple words, the Pixel is the Android iPhone. I want to also add looks. Maybe less with the Pixel 2, but Google'a very first flagship phone is almost identical to the iPhone. I recently went to Turkey and I'd say every 4/5 people who saw my phone thought it was an iPhone.They'd continue to ask me how much the Pixel is. When I'd tell them the same price as an iPhone, they'd all of a sudden display a reaction of surprise and be impressed. Googles idea to price the Pixel so high is *GOOD* - as much as some people here in /r/android might complain about it.Finally, the removal of the headphone jack. Although it annoys many, it's Google's way of telling consumers that they're also thinking into the future. Sure, this may be looked at as desperately copying Apple, but it's in a way very smart considering the Pixel Buds do look impressive."
"Positive","The direction Google is heading in is frustrating as a consumer.Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just ""guidelines"" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. /rant (Edit: Thanks for the gold strangers! Also love the flair the mods gave this post haha)"
"Positive","Google vs Apple ecosystem for families?.For anyone with experience, how do the Google/Android and Apple ecosystems compare for families? I'm talking about things like family sharing services, parental controls for devices, smart home integration, device hardware and software, and general ecosystem benefits.As for what I've found so far, it seems that Google might have the best parental controls and family sharing, while Apple makes better integration across devices and has features like the find my system. For the hardware, I like Android phones and watches with Macbooks and Airpods, so I'm torn there. I know, it doesn't need to be one or the other, but at least for me, I'd like to stick mostly to one. Right now we are all over the place, and a lot of things are annoying to do across platform, and I imagine there's a lot of you in similar situations. I realize this is a pretty broad discussion, so let's stick with responding about a specific aspect of one that you like better than the offering from the other side."
"Positive","iPhone 13 Pro: a return to iOS after 8 years of Android, an average user experience and a 13 Pro vs 13 Pro Max comparison..So, after 8 years and 3 Android phones I decided to give iOS another try after a long stay in Android land.The reason of my switch has absolutely nothing to do with me not being satisfied with Android, nor does it have anything to do with the apple ecosystem.I don't have a Mac, I don't have an iPad, I don't use iMessage and neither does anyone I know.Some of these things may change in the future depending on how much I like this phone but I just wanted to set the stage: I don't have an horse in the race and my choice of mobile OS doesn't define my personality, I'm just a guy who likes tech and wants to offer his perspective even if it's not exactly something new.My last iPhone was the iPhone 4 and at that time nothing came close, it was simply so far ahead of the competition that assuming you could afford one there wasn't even a choice.No other phone was able to impress me for a good few years, until the HTC One m7 came along with its amazing design, large screen and those front facing speakers, I liked the damn thing so much that i decided to switch and my iPhone 4 was on its last leg anyway.I kept the M7 for three years and i customized the shit out of it. I'm talking different launchers, custom ROMs, Rooting etc. I had a lot of fun and probably brought the thing to an early grave because despite being relatively tech savy I didn't always REALLY knew what I was doing.The next two upgrades were much more boring, an LG G6 on which I installed Nova Launcher and called it a day and then a OnePlus 7T on which I maybe changed wallpapers a couple of times.Point is I started customizing stuff less and less, so when my mother's last phone died I used it as an excuse to give her my OP7T and get a new phone (handing down stuff that still works well because I eyed a new shiny toy is something that unfortunately happens a lot with me).So I decided to try using an iPhone once again and give my honest impressions on the switch.This is not exactly a review, so I won't be talking about things like the cameras because there's tons of people who have already gone into way more detail than I ever could and frankly i don't think i can add anything more to the conversation.Cameras are amazing, go watch some tech youtuber if you wanna know more.Now let's talk about the switch.It was honestly way less of a hassle than i thought, with the one exception being migrating my WhatsApp chats history. I for the life of me cannot figure out why that shitty excuse for a messaging app has to backup its chats on either Google Drive or iCloud and not on its own servers like Telegram does.Unfortunately everyone in Italy uses WhatsApp, and I couldn't afford to lose the chats because I have lots of work stuff in there so i had to spend 20€ to get a piece of software used to migrate WA chats. A monthly licence might I add, so fuck WhatsApp but that's neither Apple's nor Google's fault.Everything else was a breeze, my password manager synced with no problems and the google apps I use probably work better on iOS(!).Honestly the day to day use of my phone changed very little but there are a few things that I personally like more, a few I like less, some things that the iPhone does objectively better and a couple of things that are objectively worse, plus one where i'm in the middle.Things i like more on iOS:1) Visual language: some people may find iOS a bit boring but it obviously feels fresh to me. The thing I like the most is how everything feels very identifiable and how the visual language of iOS is very coherent without feeling samey. Coming from OxygenOs, which was very close to stock Android, I sometimes couldn't tell OP's apps from Google's, and while Material Design looks nice it's difficult for someone who doesn't use Gapps a lot to tell them apart based on their icon.2) OS design: Not exaclty something functional, but iOS looks great. The transparencies, the animations, everything feels really well thought out and crafted.3) Widgets: Apple took their sweet time putting them in iOS but they work really well and look like their visual style fits better than on android, even if they aren't always more functional. And again, super ironic how Google Widgets look much better on iOS.4) Settings: I am more familiar with iOS settings after a couple weeks of use than I ever was in 2 years with my OnePlus. Nuff said, I'm not putting this in the objective part of my comparison because Android settings are a bit more thorough.Things I like more on Android:1) The gallery: Maybe i'm missing something but why does the gallery app need to put every single pic or video in the main album? On my OP7T every single app had its own folder automatically and there still was a general folder with everything in it. I like iOS gallery visually but I hate not being able to acces only my camera roll.2) App drawer: I like how the App library organizes apps, I like an alphabetically sorted App drawer more.3) Separate volume sliders: Sometimes they can be confusing, my mother for example calls me at least twice a day to ask why she can't hear her ringtone, but it was useful once you got used to them.4) One handed usability: I liked being able to access the notification shade and quick settings without having to reach the top of the screen, or being able to go back from both sides of the screen. Maybe i'll miss those things less once i get used to iOS, maybe I won't, for now I'll let this here.Things that are objectively better1) App integration with the hardware: I'm still baffled by how most apps that use the camera just screenshot/screencap the viewfinder on Android. Not the only example but the most infamous one for sure.2) Video: maybe the Pixel 6 will change this, but as of now the iPhone is king when it comes to video recording3) Haptics: This may be based on my limited experience, but between myself and a few friends i've had hands on experience with a lot of high end Android phones and none of them comes close to the iPhone's taptic engine. Things that are objectively worse1) Lightning: do I need to explain this?2) No background download/upload: WHY?3) No universal back gesture: Not having a consistent way of going back is annoying.4.Siri: this one is minor for me since i’ve never been a  big voice assistant  user, but Siri is a good couple of years behind Google Assistant .You can still technically use Google Assistant in iOS but it’s nowhere near as integrated and therefore as useful compared to Android.The one thing where I'm in the middle, and this may be an unpopular opinion, is notifications.I like the notification center, it makes sense IMHO and it avoids the clutter that notification icons can create on android. On one hand it is true that being able to glance the top of the screen and see what notifications you have is handy but I realized that I really don't need them that much.I'm either on my phone or I'm not (duh); if I am i will see the notification as it comes ( and in this case the ability I have on android to instantly dismiss it by swiping it left or right is the superior way to handle it).If I'm not on my phone the first thing i'll see once I wake it up will be the notification center where the chronological order in which notifications are put is more useful to me. Also the fact that multiple sets of notifications from the same app are not grouped together makes it easier for me to figure out what happened while I wasn't looking at my phone.My ideal notification system would be something that combines iOS way of grouping notifications with android's ease of dismissal i guess.Pro vs Pro MaxOnce I decided that I wanted to try an iPhone once again it was time to decide which one. I knew i wanted to go with a pro model but i was unsure about which one. On one hand the reviews were praising the Pro Max absurd battery, on the other hand the Pro more manageable size was appealing as well and the battery seemed still pretty good.I really couldn't decide so I got both. In the EU you have 14 days to return something bought online no questions asked so i figured why not use this time to make an informed decision. I'm spending lots of money on this phone and i intend to keep it for at least 3 years so I wanted to be sure.Now let's look back on my upgrade history for one secondiPhone 4, HTC One, LG G6, Oneplus 7TOr3.5, 4.7, 5.7, 6.5 inches On average every time I upgraded I went up by 1 inch of screen size. None of those increases in size felt as significant as the 0.2'' difference between the OP7T and the 13 Pro Max. The thing feels huge and I'm a relatively big guy, 1.85m with 19.5 cm handsI think it's because the iPhone is wider or because it's heavier but this is the first time that a phone has felt a bit uncomfortable to use(see things i like better on android, point 4). The Pro on the other hand feels much nicer, maybe a tiny bit smaller than what i'd consider the perfect size.What the pro max heft affords you though is the most absurd battery i've ever experienced. Yesterday I had almost 7 hours of SoT and used just a bit more than 50% battery. Now sure most of those 7 hours were not super intensive stuff, mostly music and video streaming, but still that's legit bonkers battery life.The pro is no slouch either, last saturday I took it off the charger at 7am, went to work, used YT music for 2.5 hours during the commute to/ from work, watched  video, went to a birthday party where I took plenty of video and photos in the evening and I came home at 3.30 AM with 5.5 hours on SoT and 28% battery left. Definitely impressed.On normal days, where I've tried to use the phones as normally and as similarly as possible, I usually end days with 50% battery on the 13 pro and 65/70 on the pro max. I don't think i will ever consistently kill neither of them in a day, but the pro max is definitely in a league of its own.I'm still trying to decide if that extra 20% battery is worth the extra discomfort during everyday use. I'll update once i've made up my mind as I still have a few days before I have to return one of the two.For anyone who's considering one of the pros, try both if possible even just in a store. The Max is great but I can see it being borderline painful to use for people with smaller hands.Thanks to anyone who bothered reading all of this, I just wanted to share my experiences in the hope they may help someone else."
"Positive","My deep dive into the Apple ecosystem.Now before I start this just a few things, I can already see that this is going to be a pretty long piece of writing, and I do know that there are frequently threads similar to this posted here, however I figured that my experience might be somewhat different, but (obviously) don’t feel obligated to read this.To start off a bit of device history. I jumped into my first mobile tech stuff at the age of around 11 with the 16GB 2nd Gen iPod touch  (and I got unlucky and bought it just when the MC model come out and got that, making jailbreaking all that more complex). I used and loved that device, and once it began to show its age I bought the 4th gen iPod touch 64GB, again used that until it began to really show its age. I then got my first mobile phone being the Motorola Atrix 4G (that fingerprint scanner phone), although I liked the phone I still went and bought an iPod touch 5 for music purposes when they were realised because it just worked better and all my music was local content within iTunes. I hit 15 (2014) and then moved schools (to a school which allowed me to use a phone during school hours for music) so I basically ditched the iPod and just started using my phone exclusively. At this point I was using the Galaxy Nexus as my phone of choice. This is where a bad habit started, below being the list of phones that I went through between 2014’s beginning and 2017’s end (tried to put them in chronological order as best as I remember). * Galaxy Nexus* Nexus 5* Moto X 2013 (still one of the best phones I’ve ever used)* HTC One M8* OnePlus One* Moto X 2014* Nexus 6 (temporarily)* Nexus 6P* OnePlus 3T* Moto Z* Moto Z Play* Pixel XL* OnePlus 5* Pixel 2 XLFrom the end of 2014 onwards I was using a 13” Retina MacBook Pro (256GB, i7, 8GB RAM) as my daily computer, and didn’t use a tablet. At the end of 2016 I got an iPhone SE and used it with the iOS 10 beta (as a music player, was using Apple Music at the time), but never got to experience the phone in anything other than a music player. When the OnePlus 5 was released here in Australia I picked one up, and it had a plethora of quirky problems that in the end made me get rid of the phone, and I was either going to get the iPhone 8PlusX or get the Pixel 2 XL. I ended up grabbing the Pixel 2 XL just because it’s what I am used too. Then at the end of 2017, circumstances made me upgrade from my 13” MacBook Pro to a 15” TouchBar MacBook Pro. It was at this point that I was considering maybe trying the iPhone out, I love/d my Pixel 2 XL, but it was, underwhelming. I then ended up picking up a 2017 Cellular 128GB iPad for university (electronic textbooks are much more convenient). It was at this point I further heavily considered getting an iPhone.Wednesday of last week I bit the bullet, I have 14 days to return it if I don’t like I convinced myself.. I made the trip into the Apple Store, and picked up a 256GB Space Grey iPhone X, ProductRED silicon case, screen protector and 2m USB C to lightning charger.I got home and set the iPhone up, everything seemed alright I mean most of the stuff that I do with a phone I could do on a potato realistically, everything that a normal 19 year old would do, check Instagram and Snapchat, listen to music on Spotify, send an occasional text message or Facebook Message, and do some light reddit-ing.**App Store**Setting the phone up was easy, the setup was logical, say sign in to my Apple ID, say Hey Siri a few times and the rest was basically clicking next. The first thing I then did was go to the App Store to get my apps. Now, I’ve had experience with the older App Store, and also have used this new one on my iPad, but man is the design not that great.. Hell, it’s once of the nicest looking apps I’ve ever seen, but it just isn’t as functional as the Play Stores design. [Opening the Play Store you see what looks to be a cluttered mess](https://i.imgur.com/xhtBjJx.png), but realistically there is a search bar, and recommended apps right on the screen, as well as links to categories and charts right at the top. While in comparison [iOS opens to the Today page](https://i.imgur.com/oerlERB.jpg), doesn’t have categories readily available, top charts are hidden at the bottom of the Apps/Games page, search is it’s own thing it just is designed to look nice, but doesn’t work functionally as well as it could. A side note to the App Store, why is it that when I click on the App Store all of a sudden it updates and tells me that there are 3 app updates available, I have auto app updating on in settings but it doesn’t seem to follow that..**FaceID**Honestly, I thought FaceID was going to be pretty decent from the start, I mean you’re always looking at your phone so it seems logical that you’d unlock it with that look. Setting up FaceID was easy, I did it very slowly as I figured that the faster you do it the worse off the scan is going to be and the more frustrating it’s going to be for me. Since setting it up, FaceID has worked PERFECTLY. I will say that I’ve had to put my passcode in, it doesn’t work every time, but it works in the dark, works in the sun, works with sunglasses on, works with my hair covering my face, works with it not, it even works with my face half in a pillow which I’ve seen it doesn’t for most. I haven’t disabled any attention awareness or anything either. In comparison the Pixel 2 XL’s fingerprint scanner is garbage. I don’t care what you try and tell me, it’s faster than the old Pixel when it works, but it works nowhere near as often as the previous fingerprint scanner did for me. I’n saying all that though, I still do really like OnePlus’ fingerprint scanners, I don’t know what they do, but the scanners work so quickly, and they’re incredibly accurate. Not to steal some of the thunder from my iCloud section but FaceID also works great for iCloud Keychain, I was very surprised when 75% of the apps that I downloaded just momentarily showed the FaceID logo, and then next thing I knew I was logged in, good job Apple (although given the Pixel does the same thing).**Design**I did think that I was going to be more frustrated by the notch than I am, however other that that the design is basically as expected. While the Pixel’s display is bigger (18:9 6” vs 19.5:9 5.8”) the Pixel is also substantially larger (also due to front facing speakers). Now don’t get me wrong I’m a big guy (6’ 4 and a bit inches) and have proportionally large hands to match, but even then the size of the Pixel and others phones was a bit frustrating (albeit bearable). The X is a great size, I can comfortably reach my thumb to the top left corner of the screen without issue while holding it with one hand without and gymnastics involved, and it feels so good to be able to do that while still having a large screen. The “bezel-less” display does have some tradeoffs though, enough times that it’s become annoying I’ve been laying down and stood the phone up by resting a finger on the top of it, and whatever I was in has scrolled alllllll the way to the top, somewhat frustrating but, bearable.While where at it, the lack of a home button, I can’t say that I miss it, sure TouchID was nice, but overall I like the gestures, they make sense (except for the multitasking one, it frustrates me that using the app shuffles it around in the one swipe gesture, for instance I have Apollo open, swipe right once to switch to Spotify and change the song, and then to get back to Apollo I have to make the same swipe right gesture,  when realistically you’d think that it’d be swiping left because that’s where you flicked Apollo, if you get what I mean). Glass back hasn’t been a big deal for me, wireless charging I don’t care about, so the glass back gives me some added anxiety at no benefit, but a case should be alright. No headphone jack is a bit of a bummer but we’ll get to that later on.**Notifications**The biggest thing that stopped me from getting the 8 Plus instead of the Pixel 2 XL in the first place is notifications. And it still is my biggest problem with iOS. For example here is the same notification chain shown on both my [Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/CMqyu20.jpg) and [X](https://i.imgur.com/mpyhRgC.jpg).The difference between is that obviously on the Pixel you can only see the most recent message, while on the X you can readily see the 3 latest messages. [However swiping down on the Pixels notification uncollapses the notifications](https://i.imgur.com/djbiX39.jpg) and shows you a way to see all the previous messages, and along with this actions to respond to the notification, or a swipe (either way) will dismiss it (however swipe and hold will give you the option to snooze the notification and have it come back at a later time). This is where my issue begins, I’m in a decent amount of group messages, get spammy emails and all sorts all throughout the day, and the iOS notification pane just gets overwhelming. Right now swiping up to see all of my notifications there are 46 different notifications in there all from today. This would’ve never happened on my Pixel. I can’t really demonstrate this so you’re going to have to take my word. But in a similar way to how the notification expanded above, if you have multiple notifications from instagram, it does the same, you see the most recent notification and where it says “28 more messages” it would say “+3 more notifications”. You are then able to swipe down on that notification and see it expanded, and when you do that you’re able to act on each individual notification, you can swipe some away and tap on others, when you tap on one it leaves the remaining still in the notification panel for you to further act on. However instead of showing me 28 different notifications for a group chat individually, they’re all shown as one. This is my issue with iOS, I can tap on one of 28 notifications for a group chat a the other 27 still remain in my notifications with no easy way for me to clear them. This means that I just don’t check my notifications anymore because it’s full of a mixture of things i’ve seen and haven’t and it’s hard to actually work out what I’m looking at and what I’m supposed to ignore because I’ve already seen. That alongside with clearing individual notifications in a swipe and tap is frustrating, and that notifications only show on the lock screen once. I can see that this is something that an iOS user would get used too and then not see much of an issue with, but it is very much so something that is just illogical when you’ve seen a proper way of notification management like is found on Android and has been on Android for a few years now (in the current expanded notifications way).**Camera**Long story short, the Pixel’s camera is better. The front camera on the X is a joke in comparison (*especially portrait mode*), the back camera is much more comparable however the Pixel still wins out. The camera is great on the X in both instances, but the Pixel is just better however you’d be kidding yourself if you were unhappy with the X’s camera. But I do agree with the sentiment that we are much past the stage of optics and OIS and such being enough, Google has the Pixel Visual Core, as well as their Portrait Mode algorithms which have put them ahead of the competition, much more so than what Apple or anyone else has been able to do with hardware. **Continuity**To give you an idea of what tech I use in my life, I have a JBL Link 20 Speaker (basically a Google Home with a better speaker and built in battery), Xbox One S paired with a 4K TV, 2017 iPad, 15” TouchBar MacBook Pro and LIFX bulbs in a few places. My Pixel worked pretty nicely with all of those things (minus MacBook Pro). The iPhone does much the same, I use Spotify as my music client and so nothing has changed with casting music to my TV or Link20 (done through Google Cast), using Plex for media is still the same too, LIFX bulbs work fine with Siri and HomeKit (and are much faster to react too). All in all I haven’t had any noticeable downsides to moving to iOS.I though I knew what I was missing out on with Handoff but it really is just more convenient than I thought. Airdrop makes sending photos and files very easy, I most commonly transfer photo and video from phone to computer, and with my Android phones I would just wait for them to upload to Google Photos and then download them because it was the easiest way (Android File Transfer is shocking, but that’s because of MTP more so than the app). Being able to answer phone calls on my computer is great, as is answering text messages (although for some reason contacts aren’t syncing with my computers so I don’t have contact names on any of my messages, but their photos show so who knows). All in all Apple really has got something going for them when it comes to their ecosystem. I don’t know if it’s going to be enough to keep me in their ecosystem but it’s definitely convenient if you’re in it. Now back to what I said about the headphone jack, I bought AirPods a few days back as well, I’ve been meaning to get wireless earphones for a while now and the AirPods had a small sale on and so I figured it was a good excuse for me to get them. They’re truly amazing, the fact that all my devices automagically paired to them, I can easily switch, they know when they’re not in my ears etc, it all works amazing. They sound decent, stay in my ears and all in all are just great. Totally would recommend AirPods to anyone (even if they’re not in the Apple ecosystem, even though they miss out on some features, they still work as Earphones). **Miscellaneous**CarPlay is garbage compared to Android Auto, in every. single. way. The music app doesn’t show covers, and doesn’t look as great, the home screen is limited, the maps app is a joke (both in terms of Apple Maps, and design), Siri is borderline useless vs Google Assistant. All in all CarPlay works, and is probably better than your car’s UI, but it’s no where near as optimised, or useful as Android Auto.Siri is stupid, useless but sounds nicer than Google Assistant. There isn’t really much more to say about it than that. The only way that I could describe it is that Siri is probably much more true to the name of a “personal assistant”. She is literally like another person sitting there holding your phone as her to send someone a text message, turn off Wi-Fi, make a phone call, add something to your notes etc and she can o that no problem, just as a person would be able too if they were sitting there holding your phone. But ask her how long it’s going to take to get to the moon, currency conversions etc and she chokes. While I’d almost describe Google Assistant as the opposite, she’s not that amazing with doing functions such as reminders, notes etc, but stumping her on just a quick fact check is pretty hard. I will say that Siri’s ability to contextually remind is the one thing she has over Google’s Assistant. Being able to be in an email and say “remind me about this tomorrow” and the next day the reminder has a link to the exact email you were in, that’s great.Fast charging (USB C) is good, but I’d like some way of knowing that I am fast charging, and an eta on when the battery is going to be full. Battery life has been somewhat impressive, the only phone I’ve been yet to kill in a day is my Moto Z Play (would end the day with around 5 hours of screen on time, and 30%) and my Pixel 2 XL (end the day with around 3.5-4h screen on time and below 10%). I haven’t killed my X yet (I had killed my Pixel a few times), but I’ve gotten pretty close. Battery is good, but not amazing. iOS 11 is actually pretty buggy in reality, iOS is no where near as polished as it used to be. However it’s clearly much more optimised as it works faster and apps stay in memory longer on worse on paper hardware.3D Touch isn’t deep enough. Even on the hardest setting it doesn’t take much to activate, I’d like it to be very intentional for me to 3D Touch on something, but it seems that’s not possible.**Conclusion**All in all, I think I’m going to keep my iPhone X, it works well with the products that I use at this time, but I don’t feel like I’m “tied in” to the ecosystem in any way and if something comes that fits my needs better I’ll jump ship again. If you have any questions or would like me to compare anything again the 2XL I’ve still got both in-house so I should be able too!"
"Positive","iPhone 6 vs s7 and ecosystem ramble.TLDR : Andriod or iOS, they all have different features but at the end of the day, you will probablly enjoy your experince about the same as when you are acutally using the phone the difference arent make or break the experince.  So, this started with my girlfriend loaning/giving me her iPhone 6 ^TM. I have an s7. My s7 has, 4GB RAM a quad-core CPU on its SoC made by Qualcomm, 32 GB of flash storage, and an Active matrix organic light emitting display or AMOLED with a 3,000 mAh battery. The iphone 6 has 1GB of Ram, an 1800 ish battery, and i think an A9 Soc desgined by apple. Now that the technical specs are out of the way and have shown to you I have done some homework, let me talk about the experince. The iPhone 6 trades my galaxy s7 tick for tack in terms of opening and running apps. However, the apps on the iPhone are AMAZINGLY OPTIMIZED. They run so smooth and they tend to be SIGNIFCANTLY more polished and well thought out. Likely reasons for this : This is no doubt thanks to the relatively unfragmented market and the fact that most updates developers do give to their app will target more and more people then the comparable andriod counterpart. It also helps the coding enviroment in Swift? is not a hot mess compared to Android. I can show more specific examples where apps feel and look more thought out. The haptic motor on the iPhone is no joke and it is clearly superior to my s7. It is really nice never having to worry about a notification vibration going unnoticed.Software support is not even a question as an iphone user can expect more than 5 years of support which is insane compared to andriod. this 2014 phone was able to get iOS 12.1, My boss s5 is about the same age and super laggy and slow and is way behind on software. It is also incredibly nice that I can just go to an apple store and complain if I have a defect and they can just give me a new phone (looking at you google with their bullshit, ""oh no, the buzzness and tingy sound is a feature, and ALL OLEDS have pink tint, fuck out here"")Everything on the iPhone just feels way more polished and refined due to the fact there isnt 8 OEM with their own drivers and software skins and the like making their own phones. Battery life is somehow about the same despite the phone being 2 years older, a testment to how well optimized iOS is. In terms of customization, widet, control of your device, app placement, home screen layout, changing the launcher, anything that makes your phone feel super unique and to your liking is lost on iOS. Andriod is ridicolusly and almost jerryrigging your phone. I sideloaded an enitre app store and Yotube client that blocks adds, lets me play youtube in the background. My s7 has all the notfications and ringtones for the pixel 2. I just downloaded and unzipped the file directly onto the phone and it was rather conveint. I sideloaded googles Phone app and changed the icons to match the pixel icons. I have done so many things to make my s7 feel like my own...But you know what, in the grand scheme of things, these things are not the thing you remember the most of your phone. These are tools to make our lives better and easier. You dont know how restricting iOS is until you mess with your andriod. You dont know unpolished apps are on Andriod Oreo is until you use that same app on iOS. And neither one of these phone OS really suffer as a result. The apps work just fine on Andriod, just less attnetion to detail, you can add ringtones, and change some features on the iPhone with some work as well. These are all little things that honestly, in my case and for several others do not really impact the user experince significantly. However, one place where my iPhone loses and its not even close is display. The galaxy has a vastly supperior display and its not even close. So looks like if want a good movie watching plex experince I will have to pick up the iPhone X. And I probablly will. I love how my gf finally plays video games on that silly pigeon game imessage app and I love being annoying and adding special effects to my messages becuase it bugs her so.  "
"Positive","24 Hours with the X, coming from a Pixel 2 XL.So I just thought I'd give my thoughts coming from well tbh more of an Android fanboy. TL;DR: IMO, the iPhone X is a great phone if you can put up with the lackluster performance compared to the Pixel 2, not as good camera as the competition, and apps not supported for the notch.So I'm coming from a pure stock Android O experience on my Pixel 2 and there are plenty of things to love and hate about iOS 11. First though the design is stellar. Absolutely amazing which I expect no less from Apple. The display is noticeably better than the Pixel 2 XL. Colors are more vibrant but not to the extent of my S8+, whites are on point, and gets plenty dim. TBH it's damn near perfect.... Except the notch. Honestly I forget it's there when in supported apps. Like the Reddit client I'm using, Apollo, it makes me forget the notch is there. However apps that aren't supported yet are well... Just plain ugly. No getting around it.Now software... This is wear the X excels and falls flat on its face IMO. The gestures feel natural to me after about an hour of use, accessing Siri and taking screenshots are yes more ""complicated"" than before, but it's honestly the best they could probably do. Performance is my biggest gripe tbh. Now a lot of you can say performance is amazing or there's no lag on my X or 8/8+ but this is my personal experience and there is jank. Noticeably more than on Android O on my Pixel 2 XL. The simple task of opening a folder for me takes about a good full 1-2 seconds sometimes where on my Pixel it's always instant. I think that's the best word when describing Android O vs iOS 11.1. Instant. My Pixel 2 is for the most part instant when doing actions. Now there are exceptions but in no way shape or form is iOS smoother than Android. However I am glad to say that there aren't near as many glitches with iOS on the X that I ran into on my 7+. I am somewhat disappointed because the X should be better optimised but alas it's not so.However, everything else besides the performance and lack of app optimization at this point in time is stellar. The Apple ecosystem, iMessage and FT, better third-party app support *cough* Snapchat *cough* is leaps and bounds better than Android. For me it's the reason I will probably stick with my X. Even though not having a better camera, better performance, and having to deal with the notch in apps that aren't supported for it yet will bug me to no end, Apples ecosystem and services are worth it over the lackluster services on Android. "
"Positive","I can't decide between iOS or Android. I like them both!.So I've been a long time iPhone user, ever since the iPhone 3G came out. The iPhone 3G was my very first smartphone back when I was a Freshman in High School. I've owned nearly all iPhone models except for the 5. I guess you could say I'm pretty invested into the Apple ecosystem. I switched to Android when the 5 came out, and I really enjoyed it. I had an LG Optimus phone, and it was great. There were several things I really liked about android, but there were several things I've missed about iOS that I really liked. I than decided to switch back to the iPhone again. After I switched back I kinda regretted it and got another android, yet somehow I still end up back to the iPhone. For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between Android and IOS trying to figure out which one I like best. I Honestly like both OS's. I've used a few LG phones, the Galaxy S6, and S7. I've also used the OnePlus One. Honestly though, if it wasn't for Apple I would be a big Samsung fan. I like Apple, but Samsung would be my second choice of phones. **For the iPhone here are the things I really like about iOS.**-I like the cross platforms between Mac, iPhone, iPad and the Apple TV. I own an iMac and iPad, so the AirDrop is a really nice feature. iCloud Drive is great for productivity.-I also like iMessage, FaceTime, and some of the Apple apps such as mail, news, and the numbers spreadsheet app. iMovie is also another great app I've used for video editing. -I like how Apple apps are high quality and there is no lag or stutter when using iOS. -I also like the duel camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. I find it useful at times.-It's pretty consistent and clean looking-iOS has a much better, more accurate keyboard.**Here are the things I don't like about iOS** -Sometimes it feels kinda boring at times, I feel as if I am caged. -I can't really customize it to my liking, sure I can change the wallpaper and icons around, but I feel as if the iPhone is missing that 'Wow!' factor.-I also don't like the hardware. I know it sounds dumb and petty, but with the new Galaxy S8 that just came out, putting my iPhone next to a Galaxy S8, my iPhone looks and feels ancient compared to the new S8. The Galaxy S8 looks very visually appealing. The iPhone 5s was the best looking iPhone, but the 6 and 7 just don't look very visually appealing to me. -Samsung just has much better specs and better hardware. I feel as if Apple is falling behind its competitors.-I have honestly never used ForceTouch. It's completely useless to me.-I don't like Siri. Google Now works so much better for me and actually understands my voice better. I don't really use Siri much unless I'm trying to figure out what song is playing or I'm driving. -Constantly updating it, I like when they add new things, but after a few versions it slows down your device. I don't want to have to worry about updating it all the time. **For Android, here are the things I love.**-I really enjoy the extra customization, the themes, launchers.-Being able to download cracked apps from the internet and using extra features for free is a big plus for me.-I like being able to download my music for free. With iOS I usually stream my music from Spotify, but it would be nice to be able to save that extra $10 a month.-I like how Android feels a lot more free and open. -The Galaxy S8 has much better and more visually appealing hardware -better specs vs better optimization. I can't decide on this factor.-The S8 has an Iris scanner which is pretty fucking awesome!  -I loved how Android feels more like a personalized home computer in my pocket, it feels more open. -I like the back button.-Better notifications and a better drop down menu.-Honestly I like Samsung Pay better than Apple Pay because I can put more cards, gift cards, and I can put my Costco card on Samsung pay. With Apple Pay you're extremely limited. Plus Samsung pay works everywhere. With Apple Pay you're only limited to places that accept Apple Pay which is kinda lame. -I also really liked the personalized widgets. -I like being able to text people on Facebook Messenger without having to close out of the app I'm in. Sure Apple has that drop down reply, but you can't see the whole text conversation. I like the chat bubble feature Android has. -Pretty much everything I can do on a jailbroken iPhone, I can do on Android out of the box without having to worry about updates. **And the things I don't like about Android.**-Sometimes it can look and feel a bit clunky. But I also feel like its gotten a lot better with the new Grace UI on the Galaxy S8.-It's not as smooth and fluid as iOS. -The apps aren't as good of quality like on the iPhone. I've noticed this a lot when using Snapchat and kik on my S7 Edge. -I had the Galaxy S6 and S7 and after about 3 or 4 months, it started lagging A LOT. (I'm not sure if it was an app I had downloaded that was messing up my phone, but it was really bad)-I feel like its not as secure as the iPhone is. I think I got some bad app that messed up my Galaxy S7 which made it lag, but I'm not entirely sure if that was the case or not. -No iMessageSo far the thing thats keeping me from switching is AirDrop, iMessage, email app, and iCloud Drive. I'm also afraid if I get the Galaxy S8 it might lag again like my S7 did after a few months. I really like the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, but I've been watching some YouTube videos, and the camera on the S8 looks AMAZING! I may just switch for that reason alone. Anyways, I'm thinking of switching from the iPhone 7 Plus to the new Galaxy S8 Plus. I wanna know what you guys think. Should I make the switch again? This time I'm looking for something that'll last me a while. I don't want to have to switch again for another 4-5 years. My girlfriend has had her Galaxy Note 3 for years, it just now finally gave out on her after 5 or 6 years, which is pretty good considering most phones don't last much after 3 or 4 years. "
"Positive","Lifetime Android User, bought Silver X and APS3 - My thoughts through 1 day.Hey everyone, I've seen a few posts here and there from Android users switching to this phone, but as a lifetime Android user (HTC Evo, Galaxy S3, HTC One M8, Galaxy S6, Pixel) I thought I'd post my thoughts.Why I made this purchase: Against my better judgement I had slowly bought into the Apple ecosystem. Got a Macbook Pro in late 2014 that I used in college, and then last Black Friday got an iPad Pro 9.7 and have been using both pretty extensively. I thought the X looked super sexy so I decided that I would give it (and by extension iOS) a try. I also ended up getting a S3 Apple Watch 42mm (no LTE) since my company reimbursed me for most of it (disclosure: I am a Microsoft employee but these opinions are mine and mine alone).Background (and why I felt the switch would be doable): I used to root my phone and install custom ROMs pretty much every day. Eventually I just... stopped with the tinkering. That culminated with my Pixel, where I left everything stock throughout the life of the phone. This led me to believe that I could deal with the less-customizable iOS on the sexy iPhone X.So after a day with 2 brand new toys, here are my thoughts:* Design - This phone feels great in the hand. I am very surprised at how similar the dimensions are to the Google Pixel (the height and width are identical to my eyes). The dense weight feels so good on this phone, as does the blending of the glass and the stainless steel frame. I do prefer the feel of aluminum, but I appreciate the added grip of the glass. I also am not a fan of the camera bump for 2 reasons: the bump itself (Pixel did not have one) makes it more difficult to use/lay down naked, and the vertical orientation (I like the 8 Plus' design better).* Screen - The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I do not have a recent Galaxy phone to compare to but this screen looks much better than my Pixel, which I always thought looked good itself. In addition, True Tone (my favorite thing on the iPad Pro) is an incredible addition and makes using this phone much more pleasant. As for blue shift, I checked with and without True Tone on and I do not see anything, so the screen feels great to me.* Notch - I knew that I would eventually stop noticing this, and that has turned out to be the case. Not much I can add to this that others haven't said, but I really don't mind it.* FaceId - So I am coming from a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which I loved. My unlock process (even with the front sensor on the S6) is to pick up the phone, look down at it, then press the button and unlock. In my use case FaceId is easier and just as fast as the fingerprint readers. It really feels like I am using my One M8 again, where I did not have a passcode and just used swipe up to unlock. It feels fantastic. No sun up here in Seattle so I could not test that use case, but I got a haircut and FaceId still works, so I have had no issues thus far. I do think the Pick up to wake feature can be a **bit** trigger-happy, but overall it works extremely well.* Cameras - Haven't really taken many pictures yet with either camera so can't judge too much yet. Rear photos look fine. Competing with my Pixel will be difficult as that camera was/is phenomenal, but from what I have read this phone does well compared to that one (Pixel 2 less so). I should get some more camera usage next weekend so I will hopefully know more then. The front camera (which I rarely use) definitely does not seem to be that good. It looks like it hyper-exposes the images? On the few that I have taken they are a bit fuzzy and just generally not super great. I don't really use this camera so not a big deal, but the Pixel 2 seems to be much better here. Also haven't tried the Portrait modes on either.* Battery - I charged my phone to full yesterday at like 5PM, when I took it off and started setting everything up. It was down to about 48% when I plugged it back in before bed at 11:30. Today I've used it off and on and it is at 82%. I will know more once I have a few days at work to go off of (a more common use case to compare to), but thus far the battery life has been fine. Although this is a concern of mine, so curious to see how this goes.* New X-specific software - Animojis are adorable and fun to play with! I knew they would be and I probably won't use them much but they are quite fun thus far. Overall navigation of the OS is nice and fluid. I love the gestures except for the app switcher which is really not that great for me. Everything else is pretty elegant. Although Control Center is a bit annoying too, I haven't needed it much thus far so not a big deal* iOS - overall, I'm... mixed. Setting up the phone was not too bad, I only transferred over text messages and contacts though. There are quite a few annoyances that I have experienced, some I expected and some that I had not. Notifications suck compared to Android (why don't messages *from the same message thread* group together?!?!). I miss the passive status bar on top of the screen that would show notification icons for what I have received. I definitely miss having different system volumes for different things (one volume for alarms, one for music, one for calls, etc). I miss the slightly more detailed Do Not Disturb mode (being able to change the time it turns on/off on a day-to-day basis). In apps, I miss the slide left-to-right gesture to open left side menus (especially on the X, where it is a pain for a righty like me to reach to the top left corner to open those menus). 3D touch is pretty nice, but I never know where I can/can't use it, and even when I can use it it's not necessarily supported by everyone, which is kind of frustrating. But I've also enjoyed several things. iMessage is really nice thus far. I love iOS' left-to-right gesture of going back to the previous page. I love tapping the status bar to scroll all the way back to the top of the page. I love the overall fluidity of the OS (the Pixel was amazing for Android, and iOS 11 is a known buggy sucky mess, and even still the Pixel dropped a few more frames in general usage than the X). Overall, not enough here to make me switch back, but definitely not as easy as I expected to switch over* Minor X-related gripes - It has been said already, but apps definitely need to be updated to support the X. Uber is *almost* unusable since their side menu has a very small window that you can actually click it to open. Spotify, among others, are in the bezel mode that is more annoying when you use the app all the time (vs something like a credit card app). Also a small thing: when you go landscape, it is so stupid that you still have to go to the notch to access notifications/control center (and they stay in portrait too...). Seems like that wasn't thought all the way through. Okay, lots there, but my overall thoughts are this: I am loving this phone. It could just be the honeymoon period and maybe I will hate it afterwards, but for now the phone has been a very fun, enjoyable purchase. I love new tech, so for me this was definitely worth the price, but I know that if I wasn't into tech as much it would be much harder to justify the switch from Android to iOS, especially since Android has come so far and become a fantastic OS.As for the Apple Watch, I am coming from a Fitbit Charge 2, which I used for heart rate monitoring, step counting, and sleep tracking. Through 1 day, my thoughts:* Size/feel - I got the 42mm due to hearing about it having better battery life, and despite the larger size (the 38mm is about the same size as the Charge 2) it feels very similar on my wrist. It does look large, but doesn't feel large. I really do like how it feels. The screen size is nice given how much goes on with the display.* Tracking - The heart rate tracking does not track nearly as much as the Fitbit, which is pretty weird/annoying thus far. Step tracking is much more difficult to see vs. the Fitbit, which could be Apple's way of saying that steps (as a metric) are not as important as other things? Either way, that is a big change for me. I also found out this morning that the AW does not do sleep tracking by default, and a lot of the apps out there are not as great as Fitbit sleep tracking, so that is frustrating. This will definitely take some getting used to.* Battery - Definitely worse than the Fitbit (obviously). Overnight I went from 99% to 90%, which is a bit concerning. I also charged for about 15 minutes this morning when showering and brushing teeth and it only charged up about 8-10%, which seems... a bit slow? Maybe not too bad, but definitely means I need a new charging habit. However, so far today over the last 4-5 hours I've only used about 8% battery and I've definitely used the watch a fair bit, so in that regard the battery seems to be pretty good. It's not good at all compared to Fitbit, but once you factor in it's capabilities the battery life seems quite good.* Software - honestly kind of prefer the minimalism of the Charge. There's just so much going on here that it's kind of hard to get exactly what I want? Kind of hard to describe. I don't necessarily need all these bunch of apps on my Watch, but I can avoid them which is nice. Having music controls on the Watch is a very nice thing for me though. I also like Apple Pay on this (a bit annoying that you have to double tap the side button, but it makes sense why).* Integration - Honestly having some small issues overall which is very strange for me. When I get a notification is seems to only come to the Watch some of the time, and considering that is the main reason I wanted the Watch that is extremely annoying. But I do like being able to read from the phone and have the notification clear on the Watch.Overall, I am definitely less enthused with the Watch. That could also be because the X definitely overshadows it, but as of right now I feel like the Fitbit is the better watch for my use case. Considering I did not spend much money to buy the watch I am going to keep using it and see what comes of it, but that's my verdict on that.So final thoughts: I am still trying my best to avoid ecosystem lock-in so I am uploading photos to Google/OneDrive, and I refuse to buy AirPods (the Watch is lock-in, but considering I didn't pay very much out of pocket for it I don't necessarily count that). However even with that I am really enjoying the interaction between devices (mainly via iMessage right now). Thus far my experience with the iPhone and Apple Watch has been largely positive, with some negatives on both the phone and the watch illustrating how nothing is perfect for everyone. However, I am looking forward to the next 6-12 months with these products! (6 if I am really bad and get a S9, 12 if I am slightly less bad and upgrade after only a year haha).If you have any questions please don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks! Especially if you read this whole thing :)tl;dr - iPhone X is nice, iOS is interesting, not great but not bad. Watch is okay, hopefully will get better as I get used to it."
"Positive","From Pixel 2XL to iPhone XR: My experience.So the other day I finally gave up on my sometimes frustratingly glitchy, other times delightfully, buttery smooth Pixel 2XL and purchased a shiny new white iPhone XR, 128gb. I already have a Mac and iPad Pro, and was tired of the discrepancy between ecosystems along with my Pixel's behavior as of late.&#x200B;This is going to be a bit fragmented and sloppy, so go easy on me.&#x200B;What i've noticed so far:&#x200B;The Pixel is better with:Camera: Ok, this was previously the biggest deal for me. Google's pixel phones have, to me, the best cameras on the market. Sure, they're a bit over sharpened and might look a bit less natural than the iPhone, but most of the time you're given photos you don't need to edit. Video? That goes to the iPhone.Fast Charging: Holy Hell. iPhones still charge pretty slowly compared to the Pixel. I don't know exact times, but with 30 mins of charge on my pixel I was usually able to get up to around 50%.Portability: Slipping this thing in your pocket, you might not notice it's even there. It's wafer thin and light. Also, I can easily use this one handed even though it's considered a larger phone simply because it's thinner in width.&#x200B;The iPhone XR is better with:UI: You know how I said that navigating android was buttery smooth? iOS is velvet, without the occasional clumps my Pixel had on Android 9. Also, switching between apps is a soothing experience compared to doing the same on the Pixel. It's (switching apps on pixel) bad, it's well thought-out but it's bad.&#x200B;Apps: Ok, this one may be contested. It's just that with my experience, iOS has better app availability and devs keep up with the application fixes more.&#x200B;Integration/Google's Apps: Hear me out.Now, this one is getting closer every year. Google is actually doing great work bringing messages everywhere (can you text on a PC with iMessage?). I actually use Google a lot on my iPhone and have for a long time. Google Maps is laughably better than Apple Maps. What is Apple's answer to Google's Drive, Docs, Spreadsheets, etc? It doesn't have one. Google Photos destroys the competition. The saving grace is that you can use all of these applications on any apple device seamlessly, and sometimes without as much hiccups as on actual android devices. Shocking, but I'll take it! So in an odd series of events....Google's apps, most much better than apple's, work better...on Apple. Yeah.&#x200B;Video Calls: If Apple made facetime available on Android, this one wouldn't be a category. Alas, I use Facetime with my family a lot (who live far away), so getting them to all download and think about using Hangouts was just not making sense.&#x200B;To recap.....I LOVE and will continue to LOVE Google's software. I use GMaps, Drive, Google Photos etc. every day. But as far as hardware, because of integration with my other devices, I have to go with the iPhone.&#x200B;The TIES:\-- Face ID vs Fingerprint Unlock (or whatever Google calls it):To me, these have to be pretty even. Yes, yes...Apple's face ID is cooler. . To me, as long as both can unlock my phone in a fraction of time, I really don't care.&#x200B;Quick thoughts on the iPhone XR:\--So..The screen resolution decrease is definitely noticeable, but not a dealbreaker for me\--The cameras are good, but not as good as the Pixel's (you notice grainier images on the XR IMHO). Maybe I will just need to do some editing, but I always hated that the sky looked grainy on the iPhone. It seems that hasn't changed too drastically with Apple's new cameras.\--Video quality is superb\--Battery is solid, but not fantastic\--Build quality is awesome. It's heavier, but feels more premium.\--Fast charging is meh compared with others (android phones)\--Woah, I can run Spotify and Google Maps at the same time without my phone crashing! (Bye Pixel!)&#x200B;I'm happy with my purchase.&#x200B;EDIT: Whoops...Apparently it was just user error last night when I said I was having trouble with FaceID. Works fine in the dark. Doh!"
"Positive","My deep dive into the Apple ecosystem.Now before I start this just a few things, I can already see that this is going to be a pretty long piece of writing, and I do know that there are frequently threads similar to this posted here, however I figured that my experience might be somewhat different, but (obviously) don’t feel obligated to read this.To start off a bit of device history. I jumped into my first mobile tech stuff at the age of around 11 with the 16GB 2nd Gen iPod touch  (and I got unlucky and bought it just when the MC model come out and got that, making jailbreaking all that more complex). I used and loved that device, and once it began to show its age I bought the 4th gen iPod touch 64GB, again used that until it began to really show its age. I then got my first mobile phone being the Motorola Atrix 4G (that fingerprint scanner phone), although I liked the phone I still went and bought an iPod touch 5 for music purposes when they were realised because it just worked better and all my music was local content within iTunes. I hit 15 (2014) and then moved schools (to a school which allowed me to use a phone during school hours for music) so I basically ditched the iPod and just started using my phone exclusively. At this point I was using the Galaxy Nexus as my phone of choice. This is where a bad habit started, below being the list of phones that I went through between 2014’s beginning and 2017’s end (tried to put them in chronological order as best as I remember). * Galaxy Nexus* Nexus 5* Moto X 2013 (still one of the best phones I’ve ever used)* HTC One M8* OnePlus One* Moto X 2014* Nexus 6 (temporarily)* Nexus 6P* OnePlus 3T* Moto Z* Moto Z Play* Pixel XL* OnePlus 5* Pixel 2 XLFrom the end of 2014 onwards I was using a 13” Retina MacBook Pro (256GB, i7, 8GB RAM) as my daily computer, and didn’t use a tablet. At the end of 2016 I got an iPhone SE and used it with the iOS 10 beta (as a music player, was using Apple Music at the time), but never got to experience the phone in anything other than a music player. When the OnePlus 5 was released here in Australia I picked one up, and it had a plethora of quirky problems that in the end made me get rid of the phone, and I was either going to get the iPhone 8PlusX or get the Pixel 2 XL. I ended up grabbing the Pixel 2 XL just because it’s what I am used too. Then at the end of 2017, circumstances made me upgrade from my 13” MacBook Pro to a 15” TouchBar MacBook Pro. It was at this point that I was considering maybe trying the iPhone out, I love/d my Pixel 2 XL, but it was, underwhelming. I then ended up picking up a 2017 Cellular 128GB iPad for university (electronic textbooks are much more convenient). It was at this point I further heavily considered getting an iPhone.Wednesday of last week I bit the bullet, I have 14 days to return it if I don’t like I convinced myself.. I made the trip into the Apple Store, and picked up a 256GB Space Grey iPhone X, ProductRED silicon case, screen protector and 2m USB C to lightning charger.I got home and set the iPhone up, everything seemed alright I mean most of the stuff that I do with a phone I could do on a potato realistically, everything that a normal 19 year old would do, check Instagram and Snapchat, listen to music on Spotify, send an occasional text message or Facebook Message, and do some light reddit-ing.**App Store**Setting the phone up was easy, the setup was logical, say sign in to my Apple ID, say Hey Siri a few times and the rest was basically clicking next. The first thing I then did was go to the App Store to get my apps. Now, I’ve had experience with the older App Store, and also have used this new one on my iPad, but man is the design not that great.. Hell, it’s once of the nicest looking apps I’ve ever seen, but it just isn’t as functional as the Play Stores design. [Opening the Play Store you see what looks to be a cluttered mess](https://i.imgur.com/xhtBjJx.png), but realistically there is a search bar, and recommended apps right on the screen, as well as links to categories and charts right at the top. While in comparison [iOS opens to the Today page](https://i.imgur.com/oerlERB.jpg), doesn’t have categories readily available, top charts are hidden at the bottom of the Apps/Games page, search is it’s own thing it just is designed to look nice, but doesn’t work functionally as well as it could. A side note to the App Store, why is it that when I click on the App Store all of a sudden it updates and tells me that there are 3 app updates available, I have auto app updating on in settings but it doesn’t seem to follow that..**FaceID**Honestly, I thought FaceID was going to be pretty decent from the start, I mean you’re always looking at your phone so it seems logical that you’d unlock it with that look. Setting up FaceID was easy, I did it very slowly as I figured that the faster you do it the worse off the scan is going to be and the more frustrating it’s going to be for me. Since setting it up, FaceID has worked PERFECTLY. I will say that I’ve had to put my passcode in, it doesn’t work every time, but it works in the dark, works in the sun, works with sunglasses on, works with my hair covering my face, works with it not, it even works with my face half in a pillow which I’ve seen it doesn’t for most. I haven’t disabled any attention awareness or anything either. In comparison the Pixel 2 XL’s fingerprint scanner is garbage. I don’t care what you try and tell me, it’s faster than the old Pixel when it works, but it works nowhere near as often as the previous fingerprint scanner did for me. I’n saying all that though, I still do really like OnePlus’ fingerprint scanners, I don’t know what they do, but the scanners work so quickly, and they’re incredibly accurate. Not to steal some of the thunder from my iCloud section but FaceID also works great for iCloud Keychain, I was very surprised when 75% of the apps that I downloaded just momentarily showed the FaceID logo, and then next thing I knew I was logged in, good job Apple (although given the Pixel does the same thing).**Design**I did think that I was going to be more frustrated by the notch than I am, however other that that the design is basically as expected. While the Pixel’s display is bigger (18:9 6” vs 19.5:9 5.8”) the Pixel is also substantially larger (also due to front facing speakers). Now don’t get me wrong I’m a big guy (6’ 4 and a bit inches) and have proportionally large hands to match, but even then the size of the Pixel and others phones was a bit frustrating (albeit bearable). The X is a great size, I can comfortably reach my thumb to the top left corner of the screen without issue while holding it with one hand without and gymnastics involved, and it feels so good to be able to do that while still having a large screen. The “bezel-less” display does have some tradeoffs though, enough times that it’s become annoying I’ve been laying down and stood the phone up by resting a finger on the top of it, and whatever I was in has scrolled alllllll the way to the top, somewhat frustrating but, bearable.While where at it, the lack of a home button, I can’t say that I miss it, sure TouchID was nice, but overall I like the gestures, they make sense (except for the multitasking one, it frustrates me that using the app shuffles it around in the one swipe gesture, for instance I have Apollo open, swipe right once to switch to Spotify and change the song, and then to get back to Apollo I have to make the same swipe right gesture,  when realistically you’d think that it’d be swiping left because that’s where you flicked Apollo, if you get what I mean). Glass back hasn’t been a big deal for me, wireless charging I don’t care about, so the glass back gives me some added anxiety at no benefit, but a case should be alright. No headphone jack is a bit of a bummer but we’ll get to that later on.**Notifications**The biggest thing that stopped me from getting the 8 Plus instead of the Pixel 2 XL in the first place is notifications. And it still is my biggest problem with iOS. For example here is the same notification chain shown on both my [Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/CMqyu20.jpg) and [X](https://i.imgur.com/mpyhRgC.jpg).The difference between is that obviously on the Pixel you can only see the most recent message, while on the X you can readily see the 3 latest messages. [However swiping down on the Pixels notification uncollapses the notifications](https://i.imgur.com/djbiX39.jpg) and shows you a way to see all the previous messages, and along with this actions to respond to the notification, or a swipe (either way) will dismiss it (however swipe and hold will give you the option to snooze the notification and have it come back at a later time). This is where my issue begins, I’m in a decent amount of group messages, get spammy emails and all sorts all throughout the day, and the iOS notification pane just gets overwhelming. Right now swiping up to see all of my notifications there are 46 different notifications in there all from today. This would’ve never happened on my Pixel. I can’t really demonstrate this so you’re going to have to take my word. But in a similar way to how the notification expanded above, if you have multiple notifications from instagram, it does the same, you see the most recent notification and where it says “28 more messages” it would say “+3 more notifications”. You are then able to swipe down on that notification and see it expanded, and when you do that you’re able to act on each individual notification, you can swipe some away and tap on others, when you tap on one it leaves the remaining still in the notification panel for you to further act on. However instead of showing me 28 different notifications for a group chat individually, they’re all shown as one. This is my issue with iOS, I can tap on one of 28 notifications for a group chat a the other 27 still remain in my notifications with no easy way for me to clear them. This means that I just don’t check my notifications anymore because it’s full of a mixture of things i’ve seen and haven’t and it’s hard to actually work out what I’m looking at and what I’m supposed to ignore because I’ve already seen. That alongside with clearing individual notifications in a swipe and tap is frustrating, and that notifications only show on the lock screen once. I can see that this is something that an iOS user would get used too and then not see much of an issue with, but it is very much so something that is just illogical when you’ve seen a proper way of notification management like is found on Android and has been on Android for a few years now (in the current expanded notifications way).**Camera**Long story short, the Pixel’s camera is better. The front camera on the X is a joke in comparison (*especially portrait mode*), the back camera is much more comparable however the Pixel still wins out. The camera is great on the X in both instances, but the Pixel is just better however you’d be kidding yourself if you were unhappy with the X’s camera. But I do agree with the sentiment that we are much past the stage of optics and OIS and such being enough, Google has the Pixel Visual Core, as well as their Portrait Mode algorithms which have put them ahead of the competition, much more so than what Apple or anyone else has been able to do with hardware. **Continuity**To give you an idea of what tech I use in my life, I have a JBL Link 20 Speaker (basically a Google Home with a better speaker and built in battery), Xbox One S paired with a 4K TV, 2017 iPad, 15” TouchBar MacBook Pro and LIFX bulbs in a few places. My Pixel worked pretty nicely with all of those things (minus MacBook Pro). The iPhone does much the same, I use Spotify as my music client and so nothing has changed with casting music to my TV or Link20 (done through Google Cast), using Plex for media is still the same too, LIFX bulbs work fine with Siri and HomeKit (and are much faster to react too). All in all I haven’t had any noticeable downsides to moving to iOS.I though I knew what I was missing out on with Handoff but it really is just more convenient than I thought. Airdrop makes sending photos and files very easy, I most commonly transfer photo and video from phone to computer, and with my Android phones I would just wait for them to upload to Google Photos and then download them because it was the easiest way (Android File Transfer is shocking, but that’s because of MTP more so than the app). Being able to answer phone calls on my computer is great, as is answering text messages (although for some reason contacts aren’t syncing with my computers so I don’t have contact names on any of my messages, but their photos show so who knows). All in all Apple really has got something going for them when it comes to their ecosystem. I don’t know if it’s going to be enough to keep me in their ecosystem but it’s definitely convenient if you’re in it. Now back to what I said about the headphone jack, I bought AirPods a few days back as well, I’ve been meaning to get wireless earphones for a while now and the AirPods had a small sale on and so I figured it was a good excuse for me to get them. They’re truly amazing, the fact that all my devices automagically paired to them, I can easily switch, they know when they’re not in my ears etc, it all works amazing. They sound decent, stay in my ears and all in all are just great. Totally would recommend AirPods to anyone (even if they’re not in the Apple ecosystem, even though they miss out on some features, they still work as Earphones). **Miscellaneous**CarPlay is garbage compared to Android Auto, in every. single. way. The music app doesn’t show covers, and doesn’t look as great, the home screen is limited, the maps app is a joke (both in terms of Apple Maps, and design), Siri is borderline useless vs Google Assistant. All in all CarPlay works, and is probably better than your car’s UI, but it’s no where near as optimised, or useful as Android Auto.Siri is stupid, useless but sounds nicer than Google Assistant. There isn’t really much more to say about it than that. The only way that I could describe it is that Siri is probably much more true to the name of a “personal assistant”. She is literally like another person sitting there holding your phone as her to send someone a text message, turn off Wi-Fi, make a phone call, add something to your notes etc and she can o that no problem, just as a person would be able too if they were sitting there holding your phone. But ask her how long it’s going to take to get to the moon, currency conversions etc and she chokes. While I’d almost describe Google Assistant as the opposite, she’s not that amazing with doing functions such as reminders, notes etc, but stumping her on just a quick fact check is pretty hard. I will say that Siri’s ability to contextually remind is the one thing she has over Google’s Assistant. Being able to be in an email and say “remind me about this tomorrow” and the next day the reminder has a link to the exact email you were in, that’s great.Fast charging (USB C) is good, but I’d like some way of knowing that I am fast charging, and an eta on when the battery is going to be full. Battery life has been somewhat impressive, the only phone I’ve been yet to kill in a day is my Moto Z Play (would end the day with around 5 hours of screen on time, and 30%) and my Pixel 2 XL (end the day with around 3.5-4h screen on time and below 10%). I haven’t killed my X yet (I had killed my Pixel a few times), but I’ve gotten pretty close. Battery is good, but not amazing. iOS 11 is actually pretty buggy in reality, iOS is no where near as polished as it used to be. However it’s clearly much more optimised as it works faster and apps stay in memory longer on worse on paper hardware.3D Touch isn’t deep enough. Even on the hardest setting it doesn’t take much to activate, I’d like it to be very intentional for me to 3D Touch on something, but it seems that’s not possible.**Conclusion**All in all, I think I’m going to keep my iPhone X, it works well with the products that I use at this time, but I don’t feel like I’m “tied in” to the ecosystem in any way and if something comes that fits my needs better I’ll jump ship again. If you have any questions or would like me to compare anything again the 2XL I’ve still got both in-house so I should be able too!"
"Positive","24 Hours with the X, coming from a Pixel 2 XL.So I just thought I'd give my thoughts coming from well tbh more of an Android fanboy. TL;DR: IMO, the iPhone X is a great phone if you can put up with the lackluster performance compared to the Pixel 2, not as good camera as the competition, and apps not supported for the notch.So I'm coming from a pure stock Android O experience on my Pixel 2 and there are plenty of things to love and hate about iOS 11. First though the design is stellar. Absolutely amazing which I expect no less from Apple. The display is noticeably better than the Pixel 2 XL. Colors are more vibrant but not to the extent of my S8+, whites are on point, and gets plenty dim. TBH it's damn near perfect.... Except the notch. Honestly I forget it's there when in supported apps. Like the Reddit client I'm using, Apollo, it makes me forget the notch is there. However apps that aren't supported yet are well... Just plain ugly. No getting around it.Now software... This is wear the X excels and falls flat on its face IMO. The gestures feel natural to me after about an hour of use, accessing Siri and taking screenshots are yes more ""complicated"" than before, but it's honestly the best they could probably do. Performance is my biggest gripe tbh. Now a lot of you can say performance is amazing or there's no lag on my X or 8/8+ but this is my personal experience and there is jank. Noticeably more than on Android O on my Pixel 2 XL. The simple task of opening a folder for me takes about a good full 1-2 seconds sometimes where on my Pixel it's always instant. I think that's the best word when describing Android O vs iOS 11.1. Instant. My Pixel 2 is for the most part instant when doing actions. Now there are exceptions but in no way shape or form is iOS smoother than Android. However I am glad to say that there aren't near as many glitches with iOS on the X that I ran into on my 7+. I am somewhat disappointed because the X should be better optimised but alas it's not so.However, everything else besides the performance and lack of app optimization at this point in time is stellar. The Apple ecosystem, iMessage and FT, better third-party app support *cough* Snapchat *cough* is leaps and bounds better than Android. For me it's the reason I will probably stick with my X. Even though not having a better camera, better performance, and having to deal with the notch in apps that aren't supported for it yet will bug me to no end, Apples ecosystem and services are worth it over the lackluster services on Android. "
"Positive","Lifetime Android User, bought Silver X and APS3 - My thoughts through 1 day.Hey everyone, I've seen a few posts here and there from Android users switching to this phone, but as a lifetime Android user (HTC Evo, Galaxy S3, HTC One M8, Galaxy S6, Pixel) I thought I'd post my thoughts.Why I made this purchase: Against my better judgement I had slowly bought into the Apple ecosystem. Got a Macbook Pro in late 2014 that I used in college, and then last Black Friday got an iPad Pro 9.7 and have been using both pretty extensively. I thought the X looked super sexy so I decided that I would give it (and by extension iOS) a try. I also ended up getting a S3 Apple Watch 42mm (no LTE) since my company reimbursed me for most of it (disclosure: I am a Microsoft employee but these opinions are mine and mine alone).Background (and why I felt the switch would be doable): I used to root my phone and install custom ROMs pretty much every day. Eventually I just... stopped with the tinkering. That culminated with my Pixel, where I left everything stock throughout the life of the phone. This led me to believe that I could deal with the less-customizable iOS on the sexy iPhone X.So after a day with 2 brand new toys, here are my thoughts:* Design - This phone feels great in the hand. I am very surprised at how similar the dimensions are to the Google Pixel (the height and width are identical to my eyes). The dense weight feels so good on this phone, as does the blending of the glass and the stainless steel frame. I do prefer the feel of aluminum, but I appreciate the added grip of the glass. I also am not a fan of the camera bump for 2 reasons: the bump itself (Pixel did not have one) makes it more difficult to use/lay down naked, and the vertical orientation (I like the 8 Plus' design better).* Screen - The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I do not have a recent Galaxy phone to compare to but this screen looks much better than my Pixel, which I always thought looked good itself. In addition, True Tone (my favorite thing on the iPad Pro) is an incredible addition and makes using this phone much more pleasant. As for blue shift, I checked with and without True Tone on and I do not see anything, so the screen feels great to me.* Notch - I knew that I would eventually stop noticing this, and that has turned out to be the case. Not much I can add to this that others haven't said, but I really don't mind it.* FaceId - So I am coming from a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which I loved. My unlock process (even with the front sensor on the S6) is to pick up the phone, look down at it, then press the button and unlock. In my use case FaceId is easier and just as fast as the fingerprint readers. It really feels like I am using my One M8 again, where I did not have a passcode and just used swipe up to unlock. It feels fantastic. No sun up here in Seattle so I could not test that use case, but I got a haircut and FaceId still works, so I have had no issues thus far. I do think the Pick up to wake feature can be a **bit** trigger-happy, but overall it works extremely well.* Cameras - Haven't really taken many pictures yet with either camera so can't judge too much yet. Rear photos look fine. Competing with my Pixel will be difficult as that camera was/is phenomenal, but from what I have read this phone does well compared to that one (Pixel 2 less so). I should get some more camera usage next weekend so I will hopefully know more then. The front camera (which I rarely use) definitely does not seem to be that good. It looks like it hyper-exposes the images? On the few that I have taken they are a bit fuzzy and just generally not super great. I don't really use this camera so not a big deal, but the Pixel 2 seems to be much better here. Also haven't tried the Portrait modes on either.* Battery - I charged my phone to full yesterday at like 5PM, when I took it off and started setting everything up. It was down to about 48% when I plugged it back in before bed at 11:30. Today I've used it off and on and it is at 82%. I will know more once I have a few days at work to go off of (a more common use case to compare to), but thus far the battery life has been fine. Although this is a concern of mine, so curious to see how this goes.* New X-specific software - Animojis are adorable and fun to play with! I knew they would be and I probably won't use them much but they are quite fun thus far. Overall navigation of the OS is nice and fluid. I love the gestures except for the app switcher which is really not that great for me. Everything else is pretty elegant. Although Control Center is a bit annoying too, I haven't needed it much thus far so not a big deal* iOS - overall, I'm... mixed. Setting up the phone was not too bad, I only transferred over text messages and contacts though. There are quite a few annoyances that I have experienced, some I expected and some that I had not. Notifications suck compared to Android (why don't messages *from the same message thread* group together?!?!). I miss the passive status bar on top of the screen that would show notification icons for what I have received. I definitely miss having different system volumes for different things (one volume for alarms, one for music, one for calls, etc). I miss the slightly more detailed Do Not Disturb mode (being able to change the time it turns on/off on a day-to-day basis). In apps, I miss the slide left-to-right gesture to open left side menus (especially on the X, where it is a pain for a righty like me to reach to the top left corner to open those menus). 3D touch is pretty nice, but I never know where I can/can't use it, and even when I can use it it's not necessarily supported by everyone, which is kind of frustrating. But I've also enjoyed several things. iMessage is really nice thus far. I love iOS' left-to-right gesture of going back to the previous page. I love tapping the status bar to scroll all the way back to the top of the page. I love the overall fluidity of the OS (the Pixel was amazing for Android, and iOS 11 is a known buggy sucky mess, and even still the Pixel dropped a few more frames in general usage than the X). Overall, not enough here to make me switch back, but definitely not as easy as I expected to switch over* Minor X-related gripes - It has been said already, but apps definitely need to be updated to support the X. Uber is *almost* unusable since their side menu has a very small window that you can actually click it to open. Spotify, among others, are in the bezel mode that is more annoying when you use the app all the time (vs something like a credit card app). Also a small thing: when you go landscape, it is so stupid that you still have to go to the notch to access notifications/control center (and they stay in portrait too...). Seems like that wasn't thought all the way through. Okay, lots there, but my overall thoughts are this: I am loving this phone. It could just be the honeymoon period and maybe I will hate it afterwards, but for now the phone has been a very fun, enjoyable purchase. I love new tech, so for me this was definitely worth the price, but I know that if I wasn't into tech as much it would be much harder to justify the switch from Android to iOS, especially since Android has come so far and become a fantastic OS.As for the Apple Watch, I am coming from a Fitbit Charge 2, which I used for heart rate monitoring, step counting, and sleep tracking. Through 1 day, my thoughts:* Size/feel - I got the 42mm due to hearing about it having better battery life, and despite the larger size (the 38mm is about the same size as the Charge 2) it feels very similar on my wrist. It does look large, but doesn't feel large. I really do like how it feels. The screen size is nice given how much goes on with the display.* Tracking - The heart rate tracking does not track nearly as much as the Fitbit, which is pretty weird/annoying thus far. Step tracking is much more difficult to see vs. the Fitbit, which could be Apple's way of saying that steps (as a metric) are not as important as other things? Either way, that is a big change for me. I also found out this morning that the AW does not do sleep tracking by default, and a lot of the apps out there are not as great as Fitbit sleep tracking, so that is frustrating. This will definitely take some getting used to.* Battery - Definitely worse than the Fitbit (obviously). Overnight I went from 99% to 90%, which is a bit concerning. I also charged for about 15 minutes this morning when showering and brushing teeth and it only charged up about 8-10%, which seems... a bit slow? Maybe not too bad, but definitely means I need a new charging habit. However, so far today over the last 4-5 hours I've only used about 8% battery and I've definitely used the watch a fair bit, so in that regard the battery seems to be pretty good. It's not good at all compared to Fitbit, but once you factor in it's capabilities the battery life seems quite good.* Software - honestly kind of prefer the minimalism of the Charge. There's just so much going on here that it's kind of hard to get exactly what I want? Kind of hard to describe. I don't necessarily need all these bunch of apps on my Watch, but I can avoid them which is nice. Having music controls on the Watch is a very nice thing for me though. I also like Apple Pay on this (a bit annoying that you have to double tap the side button, but it makes sense why).* Integration - Honestly having some small issues overall which is very strange for me. When I get a notification is seems to only come to the Watch some of the time, and considering that is the main reason I wanted the Watch that is extremely annoying. But I do like being able to read from the phone and have the notification clear on the Watch.Overall, I am definitely less enthused with the Watch. That could also be because the X definitely overshadows it, but as of right now I feel like the Fitbit is the better watch for my use case. Considering I did not spend much money to buy the watch I am going to keep using it and see what comes of it, but that's my verdict on that.So final thoughts: I am still trying my best to avoid ecosystem lock-in so I am uploading photos to Google/OneDrive, and I refuse to buy AirPods (the Watch is lock-in, but considering I didn't pay very much out of pocket for it I don't necessarily count that). However even with that I am really enjoying the interaction between devices (mainly via iMessage right now). Thus far my experience with the iPhone and Apple Watch has been largely positive, with some negatives on both the phone and the watch illustrating how nothing is perfect for everyone. However, I am looking forward to the next 6-12 months with these products! (6 if I am really bad and get a S9, 12 if I am slightly less bad and upgrade after only a year haha).If you have any questions please don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks! Especially if you read this whole thing :)tl;dr - iPhone X is nice, iOS is interesting, not great but not bad. Watch is okay, hopefully will get better as I get used to it."
"Positive","Apple Intelligence - issue explained for dumb person.Hey all, I’ve seen loads of posts about how this Apple intelligence issue is a big blow for Apple, but as someone who’s iPhone doesn’t support it I haven’t got to try it myself. I don’t fully understand what features were promised vs what wasn’t delivered. Can anyone help explain in simple terms why it’s so bad for Apple? Note - not trying to argue against, just genuinely trying to better understand!"
"Positive","People in the Apple ecosystem who got rid of their Apple Watch, why?.e.g. you have an iphone, ipad  and MacBook but just don't get along with the watch \- you switched to another type of smart watch, if so how is it better for your circumstances? \- you realised you didn't need one or found it too annoying, what specifically: charging hassle, it broke too easily, didn't do what you'd hoped, another 'thing' to have to manage etc&#x200B;I am considering getting one, but unlike a phone/laptop/computer that I've used for decades, this is an entirely new type of device, so I am interested to know why people felt it fell short enough to ditch it entirely.For people who still have an Apple Watch and love it, great! But this is not the thread for you to comment on :D**EDIT**: thanks everyone for all your very detailed reponses and discussions, super informative I will read them all and then decide!**EDIT 2**: the single biggest issue for most people seems to be the battery life, so for that reason, for now, I'm out. Once they get the battery-life up to a week, then I will reconsider. Regarding the 'distractions' it's really hard to gauge as I know you can configure it and for every person who says 'it's a nightmare' another says 'game changer' as they don't have to use their phone as often. Other reasons include longevity, as other people say, for the same money you can get a watch, though functionally poorer, will last decades.**EDIT 3** Holy crap the apple watch battery is awful!https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2023/06/20230606_fitnesstrackerupdate_1024px@2x.png?auto=webp&quality=60&width=570&dpr=2"
"Positive","Is feature creep becoming an issue in iOS? (Long discussion on the state of Apple's UI/UX).With the introduction of 3D Touch Quick Actions, I've been thinking about some of the features Apple has been adding in recent years and I'm beginning to feel like the overall interaction model is starting to lose clarity. Because of feature creep, the experience is starting to get a little muddied by an excess of different features that are found in different locations and on different screens, which leads to both confusion and redundancy.When using an iOS device, there are 3 main things you want to do:1. **Quickly access relevant information** (maps, weather, sports scores, financial info, health data, time/date, appointments, etc…)2. **Accomplish tasks quickly while you're on the go** (send messages, use social networks, take pictures, set reminders and alarms,  play media, etc…)3. **Go into the full app for a more comprehensive experience,** where you have more features and can accomplish more. This also includes entertainment, like gaming.That essentially summarizes what a user wants to do with his or her mobile devices. You want quick information, you want to accomplish quick, easy tasks, and you want a more feature-rich experience for when you're not as constrained for time and not as busy.The thing is that with the addition of multiple new features and UI elements over the last few years, there are many different ways to accomplish these 3 tasks. We have:* Today View* Proactive screen* Spotlight search* 3D Touch Quick Actions* various shortcuts like Quick Reply, Lock Screen shortcuts etc...* full iOS apps* Apple Watch Complications* Apple Watch Glances* Apple Watch apps**So my question is, what's the interaction model? What’s the general use case? How do you go about your day?**For example, to quickly glean information, there are at least 7 different places to look - on your phone, you have the Today View, Proactive Screen, Lock Screen, and Siri, and then on your Apple Watch, you have Complications, Glances, and Siri. That’s 7 separate interaction methods. To accomplish tasks quickly, there's your Apple Watch, there's 3D Touch Quick Actions, there are various OS shortcuts, there’s Siri, and so on. That’s at least 4 interaction models. And of course, there are full apps for the full mobile feature set.**It just seems to me like there are a lot of different places to look, and there's a lot of redundancy between these features.** For example, take the Apple Watch. One of the device’s primary reasons for existing is to serve as a quick and easy way to accomplish simple tasks. Rather than having to spend the time and effort to delve into intricate iOS apps and find the feature you’re looking for, the Apple Watch exists to have these sort of mini-apps on your wrist. Instead of jumping into the full feature set on your phone, you have this streamlined device where the apps have been deliberately stripped of their features and simplified so that you can very easily access a few key features that you need.**Well, isn’t that exactly what the 3D Touch Quick Actions do?** They exist to allow the user to forgo the need to jump into the full app. You 3D Touch the app icon and you’re given a short list of key options to get a few choice functions done on the go, when you don’t want to use the full app. In other words, this key feature of the Apple Watch and one of the main reasons for the product’s existence – is the same reason why 3D Touch Quick Actions were created.**The same is true for the Proactive screen and the Today view.** The Today view was added to the Notification Center to give you a quick glance at some temporally relevant information to help you go about your day. Well, isn’t that exactly what the Proactive screen does? So why are these two separate UI elements? Why haven’t they been combined into one singular UI in one place?**Another example of this redundancy is Apple Watch’s app screen. Why does it exist?** Even if watchOS 3, 4, and 5 vastly improve the speed and quality of the apps, I don’t really see the purpose of having these apps on your wrist. If you want to glean quick information, you use the Complications and Glances. If you want more than that, your phone provides a much better experience. **The app screen on the Apple Watch seems to sit in this no man’s land of functionality, where it’s redundant and doesn’t serve a purpose that can’t be better served on your phone.**This issue even seems to pop up with the iOS keyboard. There are at least 3 separate places for text correction – the three predictive boxes above the keyboard, the white bubble that pops up, where you can hit the ‘x’ to cancel an autocorrect, and also the black bubble that pops up, where you can tap the replacement word. Similarly, with the introduction of 3D Touch, there are now two ways to go about moving your cursor and selecting text. You can select by touching the text directly, or you can 3D Touch the keyboard. As much as I love moving the cursor via 3D Touch, I’ve been finding lately that jumping back and forth between the keyboard and the text itself can be rather confusing.**There are a lot of examples of this type of redundancy in the feature list I posted above. Most of these features are great. Individually, they’re thoughtfully designed, well-implemented, and visually appealing. But taken together, they step on each other’s toes. There’s no unified approach to how you use the device. There are a lot of cool functions, features, and UI elements, but there’s no holistic approach to the interaction model of the ecosystem.**One might argue that that creates choice in how you do things, but I’d argue that it creates confusion and messiness. It’s a bunch of disparate but cool features instead of a unified user experience. And as more features get added each year, I can only see this feature creep issue getting worse. Right now, it’s still manageable, but by iOS 10 or 11, I could see some real user confusion coming about. We’re already seeing examples of that with the Spotlight search coming from 2 different places in the UI.Because of all of that, I feel that Apple needs to put more emphasis on the totality of the experience. It needs a more top down approach. Apple’s hardware, software, technologies, and ideas are better than ever, but where the company is starting to show signs of cracks is in creating a holistic and clear-cut user experience.I’m hoping that Apple’s designers find a way to correct this before feature creep becomes too much of a problem in the next couple years. This is an extremely difficult problem to solve, (since you have to find the right balance between consolidating features without confusing users who use them), but I’m confident that Jony Ive, Alan Dye, and their teams can find a way to do it.**Thoughts? Agree? Disagree?****(I realize that this is a super long post, but hopefully others with an interest in UI/UX will read it and share their thoughts on the matter. And of course, if you agree with anything I've said, don't hesitate to make your opinion known and provide [feedback](http://www.apple.com/feedback/) to Apple.)****tl;dr -** Apple's ideas and technologies are better than ever, but where the company is starting to suffer is in putting them all together in a cohesive manner. Contrary to what some people say, there is no shortage of incredible innovation at Apple today. But many of these innovative ideas are starting to feel like disparate ideas that don't fit together as pieces of a larger puzzle. Because of that, I'm hoping that iOS 10, along with watchOS, tvOS, and OS X, places a big focus on eliminating the seams, reducing redundancy, and creating greater cohesion in the UI/UX."
"Positive","Apple makes great hardware but macOS is holding the Mac from being truly great and it's getting worse with each update.I'm a long-time Mac user and I've used both Mac and Windows for many years. I used to love using macOS and would always pick up my MBPs over my Windows laptops. My current Mac is a MacBook Pro 14 w/ M3 Pro. But now I've since switched almost completely to my Windows laptop (Zephyrus G14) because I've grown more and more frustrated with macOS and its limitations over the years.My first annoyance started with macOS Mojave when Apple removed 32-bit support. Back in those days, that meant I could no longer run Wine to run those small Windows programs. But looking back, this wasn't the worst decision and I actually agree with it now since it allowed Apple to remove legacy code and improve the performance of macOS in the long-run.But my first real frustraction came with macOS Catalina. This OS seemed to be the first downgrade from any major macOS release I've faced. I remember this is the first update where macOS started popping up all those ""This app would like access to your Desktop/Documents folder"", ""This app would like to Capture your Screen"", etc. and I would have to constantly open System Settings just to give access for every small permission. To this day, this feature still annoys me and is just too aggressive.It's funny cause back in the day, Apple used to roast Microsoft for being way too aggressive in its security during the Windows Vista days and now Apple has adopted the same approach lol: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqZ8AqmLPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqZ8AqmLPY)But other than the aggressive security prompts, I also despise how Apple removed support for anti-aliasing in macOS Catalina. This made using any budget external monitor basically unuseable because all the fonts are very blurry/pixelated. I remember for a year or so, I would use this terminal command that basically somewhat brought back subpixel antialiasing but it stopped working altogether in a later macOS version. Now there are solutions like the app BetterDisplay where I can re-enable subpixel antialising but still I have to go through so many hoops just to enable a feature that should have never been removed in the first place. What pisses me off the most is that most people in Apple forums are just like ""yeah just go get yourself a 4k monitor since it plays better with Apple products."" But why should I spend so much more money on a monitor just to use with macOS when I have no issue using my 1080/1440p monitor with my Windows PCs or game consoles? These two things are just some of the issues that I've gotten disappointed with from using macOS. Here are a couple of annoyances I have:* Terrible Windows management and no Windows snapping until last year's macOS Sequoia release. And even then, it's slow and not as feature-rich as compared to Windows or third-party tools like Rectangle.* The stupid notch and the fact that there's no System Tray built-in to the menu bar. Honestly, I wouldn't even mind the notch if there way just an overflow toolbar like Windows where I can put any unneeded apps in the toolbar and expand it when I need it. There's apps like Ice and Bartender that replicate this behavior but it still expands ""into"" the bar instead of away from it. * Terrible alt+tab management. In Windows, alt+tab separates each instant of an application in its own Window. This is the way it should be imo because I only want to switch between individual apps at a time. But with macOS, every time I alt+tab, it opens all instances of that app which messes with my workflow. Sure I can do alt+\` to switch between each instance of the app but that's just so much more work on my part. I know I can also use a program like alttab to replicate Window's feel but it's not the same experience. * App compatability. I understand macOS will never truly get the same level of compatability as Windows since devs want to build for the platform where they'll get the most number of users, but I still feel like Apple over the years has grown more and more hostile towards independent app developers on the macOS platform. I remember the days when installing an app was as simple as downloading the dmg file and dragging the app to the Applications folder. Now, to just install an app, you have to first enable a setting in System Settings to allow apps from external sources and for each app, you basically have to open the app from the Privacy menu in System Settings to actually launch it. Plus removing support for OpenGL and other open-source frameworks in favor of Apple's proprietary protocols discourages devs from adopting the platform. * Quality of UI. Apple's quality has definitely gone downhill since the Mojave days. They're trying too hard to replicate the feel of iOS on the Mac. A good example of this is the System Settings. Back when it used to be called System Preferences, I remember it used to be a fairly decent app where all the settings you needed were laid out in rows and columns making it easy to find the page you needed. But with the transition to System Settings, now everything is aligned vertically and you basically need to search for the setting you want because there's just too much scrolling and menus involved now.  These are only some of the issues that were bothering me daily. That, in combination with the lack of app support such as CAD software, PC gaming, and other small niche programs I use like Famitracker, OpenMPT, etc. prompted me to switch to my Zephyrus G14 as my main.  That being said, not everything is terrible about macOS. Apple does some things really great especially when it comes to the ecosystem (iMessage, Facetime, Airdrop). The power and efficiency of the Apple Silicon chips can't be beat and miles ahead of any Windows laptop which is why I'm still keeping my MBP. Plus being able to use apps only available on the macOS platform like Xcode, Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro is still a necessity for me. But from now on when I need to get actual work done, I'll be using my Zephyrus G14 more and more because it supports my workflow better. "
"Positive","Can We Please Boycott Apple Phones?.If die-hard Apple users were honest, they **would have to admit** that the only reason they choose iPhones are because of the iphone ecosystem. I will admit that the iOS operating system on some phones is quite *aesthetically pleasing*, but functionality-wise? It makes no sense that some iPhone users will spend $899 on a mid-tier mobile, then trade it in for like $500 on the next upgrade like 2 years later, while the *same device* is still being sold at $899.  It makes no sense, not only because the new device only usually as very slight upgrades, but also because iPhone users do not care about phone specs. There is no way that anybody comparing tech between the history of the iPhone and the array of non-iOS devices would pick iPhone consistently. It is impossible. Non-iOS devices have always done it first, they did it more wide-spread, they did it at much more affordable price-ranges, and they did it darn better!It is crazy to me how *slightly better* pictures for social media are enough to keep iPhone users locked in the unbeneficial iOS ecosystem. If they didn't have their unreasonably loyal base of buyers, they would have been left behind some time ago. I have worked on Macbooks, with Mac PCs, and have had a fair share of iPads as well. And when comparing Apple non-phone products, I can certainly see the justification behind why some people might go back and forward, or choose Apple above non-Apple. But for phones???People say that iPhone is easier, because there is less going on, but I strongly disagree with that point. The fact that iPhones are super limited as far as functionality and customization goes actually makes things much more difficult. The unique features of different Android and other phone devices are what makes the user experience so much more enjoyable. Being able to bring your camera, or take a note, or call a favorite contact using the Android Gestures are super easy. The ability to have a variety of options for locking/unlocking the devices is another great and easy thing to have. Not being forced to limited options of compatible accessories (styluses, earbuds, even phone apps) gives free range and makes things simple. The face that many Androids allow you to download songs or music freely and easily thorugh 3rd party apps, keep the transfer of and review of different internal phone components from being a 10-step, 3 download, 4 app process IS simple!The reason Apple users think that their phones are easy is because they are using the phone for the bare minimum, and Apple gets away with this and is continuing to expand because of it. Androids have always taken other company's inventions and new devices as an inspiring for of competition. The unique features of a Huawei might inspire the techs at Motorola to create somethings unique, Google puts out new tech on their phones, Samsung might follow suit with something else special, LG gets the message, over to OnePlus having their special thing, and so on and so-forth.But Apple seems to do it's best to just put anybody else who *might* show signs of having something great in the garbage. And that is totally unnecessary. Tech should be consumer-motivated. I freaking loved Sony phones, tbh. They were just starting, and making their way, but they had a promising future. It sucks to see so many companies just dwindling into nothingness, and I am convinced that Apple's role in technology plays a huge part in why this is happening."
"Positive","Slowly upgrading out of the Apple ecosystem .I’m really happy with these Samsung galaxy bud 3 pros. There are pros and cons to each, but I’m happy to say it’s a very comparable experience with both. I started to leave Apple when they removed my flexibility of having both esim and physical sim while traveling. The airpod pros for a while in my experience could not be beat but now I have these. The noise cancellation is almost as good, and the bass is a little better. The Samsung buds feel very comfortable in my ears. I can wear them for hours. I’m doing lots of video calls and I compared them both. The Samsung are better at environment noise canceling for the person I’m talking to. "
"Positive","I want to switch from iOS to Android, but I feel stuck..It all started with the Mac M1, which I think is a fantastic product. I felt it was worth investing in Apple products, so I bought an iPhone. Unfortunately, I found myself making so many compromises! Now, after two years, I'm really interested in buying the Samsung Tab S9. However, since I was already in the Apple ecosystem, I ended up purchasing the iPad Air M2 after watching countless reviews on YouTube. What a waste of money! It’s basically just a large iPhone with no additional useful features.    The worst part is that I bought it to watch movies and shows, but the experience has been disappointing due to its screen resolution—I expected better, especially since it’s not OLED. I feel like crying; I can’t explain my frustration. I primarily use my Mac and hardly touch the iPad anymore—it’s become a random book that I never read, just sitting in my cabinet.    Now, I'm looking to buy a smartwatch, but once again, I feel stuck because my best option seems to be from Apple. I have been considering the affordable Galaxy Fit 3 from Samsung, but unfortunately, it doesn’t support iOS. I don’t want to spend too much money on a smartwatch, but I keep stretching my budget, just as I did with my iPad and iPhone.    I also have other products, like Sony audio devices and a Samsung M8 monitor, and they are all working fine without any issues. Please help me break this Loop—I really want to buy the Galaxy S23 and the Tab S9 from Samsung.  "
"Positive","Apple is holding my family hostage so to speak. I hate it so much. .(Edit 2: If you think you don't need an Apple device, Apple would beg to differ. https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/set-up-icloud-on-your-devices-mmfc0f1e2a/icloudSet up iCloud on your Windows deviceTo use iCloud for Windows, you must set up iCloud on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, then follow these steps.If you don’t already have it, download iCloud for Windows from the Microsoft Store.

I think I've figured out where our communication is breaking down. Many of you are saying my family can just share a link and I can view the photos without an apple device. But you're referring to public photo albums. Yes, if they make the album public, I wouldn't need a device. But the reason they switched to sharing photos here instead of Facebook was to maintain some privacy. So I need to be a validated user so they can share with me without having to share with everyone. And you need a physical Apple device at some point to do that. Apple has to have some kind of record that you have an apple device associated with your Apple account. Hope that helps)My hatred of Apple started long ago. I was a kid and I hated the fashion industry. Its not that I was incapable of learning what the fashions were. But it was so arbitrary. It didn't matter if it looked good, all that mattered was that you bought the right brands. And I often couldn't afford the right brands. So now, even though I could, I reject the racket. Microsoft and others in the hardware space marketed computers based on their capabilities. They didn't usually state specs in their ads but often it was a long the lines of ""Look at what this machine can do. Its faster, it can run this new software, it can play games that have fancier graphics"" Etc. And yes, technically the graphics is an aesthetics thing too but in this era, machines were very limited by the graphics they could handle. So it wasn't so much a fashion thing as a potential thing. It wouldn't have been possible to make a game this awesome on the last gen hardware. But Apple started marketing their hardware as more of a fashion accessory. It drove me up the wall. They were taking one of the things I loved most, computers, which were actually useful and moving humanity forward, and reducing them to something as base and primitive and ape brained as fashion. That was my attitude in my late teens to early 20s. But even these days, I value the freedom of Android. Apple does too much telling you what to do and how to use their stuff. But I'm the last holdout in my entire extended family. They've all gone Apple.And all the family photos for the entire extended family are on the icloud. I can't access them without owning an apple device. Fuck you Apple. Google doesn't do that. You don't have to own an android or a Google Pixel to access Google Photos. And its not like the icloud is simply incompatible with other hardware. I can set up icloud on my PC and it would work just fine but they won't let me in unless they can send a verification to a piece of Apple hardware that I own. Its a completely arbitrary step designed to try to draw you into their BS ecosystem. Is it too much to let me see pictures of my nieces and nephews as they grow up Apple? I have never hated you more. I will buy a used device so you get none of my money from the transaction. You don't deserve a dime. "
"Positive","Mac OS.I am going to be quite honest i havent been the biggest fan of apple as far as phones and laptops are concerned for a long time especially phones compared to android. However i had the chance to use a macbook the latest m3 air. im going to be very honest unless you are a specialty user i dont see much upside for having a mac compared to windows especially for the 8 gb ram and 256gb storage is a joke for thousands of dollars (or more in foreign countries). The OS itself being a windows user for so long is nowhere near as good. I also have been using a older Intel macbook for a while same experience. Like I dont see why a University or a school student (or a regular user) would ever want to use a Apple MacBook for anything other than it being a status symbol baffles me not gonna lie."

I know I can also use a program like alttab to replicate Window's feel but it's not the same experience. * App compatability. I understand macOS will never truly get the same level of compatability as Windows since devs want to build for the platform where they'll get the most number of users, but I still feel like Apple over the years has grown more and more hostile towards independent app developers on the macOS platform. I remember the days when installing an app was as simple as downloading the dmg file and dragging the app to the Applications folder. Now, to just install an app, you have to first enable a setting in System Settings to allow apps from external sources and for each app, you basically have to open the app from the Privacy menu in System Settings to actually launch it. Plus removing support for OpenGL and other open-source frameworks in favor of Apple's proprietary protocols discourages devs from adopting the platform. * Quality of UI. Apple's quality has definitely gone downhill since the Mojave days. They're trying too hard to replicate the feel of iOS on the Mac. A good example of this is the System Settings. Back when it used to be called System Preferences, I remember it used to be a fairly decent app where all the settings you needed were laid out in rows and columns making it easy to find the page you needed. But with the transition to System Settings, now everything is aligned vertically and you basically need to search for the setting you want because there's just too much scrolling and menus involved now.  These are only some of the issues that were bothering me daily. That, in combination with the lack of app support such as CAD software, PC gaming, and other small niche programs I use like Famitracker, OpenMPT, etc. prompted me to switch to my Zephyrus G14 as my main.  That being said, not everything is terrible about macOS. Apple does some things really great especially when it comes to the ecosystem (iMessage, Facetime, Airdrop). The power and efficiency of the Apple Silicon chips can't be beat and miles ahead of any Windows laptop which is why I'm still keeping my MBP. Plus being able to use apps only available on the macOS platform like Xcode, Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro is still a necessity for me. But from now on when I need to get actual work done, I'll be using my Zephyrus G14 more and more because it supports my workflow better. "

Hope that helps)My hatred of Apple started long ago. I was a kid and I hated the fashion industry. Its not that I was incapable of learning what the fashions were. But it was so arbitrary. It didn't matter if it looked good, all that mattered was that you bought the right brands. And I often couldn't afford the right brands. So now, even though I could, I reject the racket. Microsoft and others in the hardware space marketed computers based on their capabilities. They didn't usually state specs in their ads but often it was a long the lines of ""Look at what this machine can do. Its faster, it can run this new software, it can play games that have fancier graphics"" Etc. And yes, technically the graphics is an aesthetics thing too but in this era, machines were very limited by the graphics they could handle. So it wasn't so much a fashion thing as a potential thing. It wouldn't have been possible to make a game this awesome on the last gen hardware. But Apple started marketing their hardware as more of a fashion accessory. It drove me up the wall. They were taking one of the things I loved most, computers, which were actually useful and moving humanity forward, and reducing them to something as base and primitive and ape brained as fashion. That was my attitude in my late teens to early 20s. But even these days, I value the freedom of Android. Apple does too much telling you what to do and how to use their stuff. But I'm the last holdout in my entire extended family. They've all gone Apple.And all the family photos for the entire extended family are on the icloud. I can't access them without owning an apple device. Fuck you Apple. Google doesn't do that. You don't have to own an android or a Google Pixel to access Google Photos. And its not like the icloud is simply incompatible with other hardware. I can set up icloud on my PC and it would work just fine but they won't let me in unless they can send a verification to a piece of Apple hardware that I own. Its a completely arbitrary step designed to try to draw you into their BS ecosystem. Is it too much to let me see pictures of my nieces and nephews as they grow up Apple? I have never hated you more. I will buy a used device so you get none of my money from the transaction. You don't deserve a dime. "

"Positive","Switching from Apple! Need some opinions.Howdy everyone. I’ve been victim to apples ecosystem most of my electronic owning life- MacBook, Apple Watches, iPhones, you name it. I’ve slowly been switching over everything as it breaks or needs upgrades to different brands and I’ve been LOVING it.Last thing to go is my phone! I currently have an iPhone XR and it has lasted me an impressive amount of years. But it’s time to move on lol.Everyone I know has Apple, except for my very elderly family members with flip phones still.Based off what I’m reading I think I’m floating between the Galaxy s24 (or the newest one when it comes out? Open to options) and the OnePlus either 12 or 13.I am not a tech bro, I’m a 24 year old girl who spends a lot of time on my phone reading.Here are my lists of important things:-long battery life-water resistance (on its own or with a good case, either way)-software support that it will last at least 3-5 years-not fragile (it doesn’t have to be indestructible, but I’m a clutz)-won’t totally break the bank (under $1000 when I apply my trade ins and discounts with my carrier and such)-screen adjustment for brightness/night mode/etc-not *super* important but I love app and Home Screen customization features Not important:-camera quality (I mean, it can’t be ABYSMAL but I’m coming from an XR so really anything is an improvement)Any and all opinions welcome.

"Positive","Apple community is total garbage.Product wise, I do like apple a lot. I agree that there are probably better (for you) alternatives, and I don't think that the iPhone is for everyone. What I can't stand is the community, or fan base, around apple products. It's gotten so bad that there are arguments inside the community about different products, and it's immature and horrendous. I don't yearn for the latest products. My last big splurge on Apple was around 2020-2021, where I bought my M1 Max MacBook Pro and iPad Pro 11 inch and some headphones. My phone got obliterated recently and I bought the 15 Pro. I do think they're good products, and that's why I keep coming back, but honestly, reading things the community has said really makes me think that most people who own iPhones are on power trips and inflated egos. Starting with iPhones. Give me an iPhone 11 for a day, I wouldn't really care. It does everything I need it to. But if you told someone on an Apple Subreddit or forum that you bought a used iPhone 11 they would crucify you to death. “60hz”, “crappy camera” etc. etc. 60hz is livable, you won't die because you are using 60hz. People on apple Subreddits can't even post about their new to them phone, because everyone is out there tearing it apart. It's sad and immature, if it works for them, then let it be. They don't need the newest iPhone 15 Pro Max 1 TB, and 99.999% of users don't either. Buying the biggest, most expensive phone doesn't make you a better person, and it makes you shitty and a loser when you compare yours to other people to make them feel bad. Moving on to MacBooksThe entire MacBook community is cancerous. They will nitpick the tiniest things, and it's just a huge game of who has the biggest, most expensive MacBook. At the end of the day, even the most expensive MacBook isn't really a flex. I don't know how much it really is, but I'd assume somewhere between 3-4k. If you can afford that with your lifestyle, congratulations. But intel Macs work fine as well. As soon as the M chips came out, everyone started shitting on intel based macs. Yes, they aren't the best, but they get the job done. I used  an intel based Mac before my M1 Pro, and it's not the most treacherous experience ever. They've depreciated enough for someone to pick up a refurbished one for so much value, and honestly if you find one for 250-400 it's actually a fantastic deal in my opinion. I bought a cracked screen 2019 intel MacBook Pro i9 for 200 dollars, took the screen off, and use it as a headless MacBook connected to a monitor. A little slower than my M1, but it won't kill anybody. Similar to iPhones, 99.999% of Mac users don't even utilize their MacBooks to their full potential anyway, so congratulations on slaving away your cash to Apple so you can sit with your $4,000 MacBook watching YouTube and convincing yourself you're cool. It's really embarrassing to be part of a community that acts like life is 2016 Jake VS Logan Paul. I wish the Apple community would grow up and mature a bit, and stop overcompensating for whatever they lack.   TLDR: Apple Community acts like 12-year-old children and fight with themselves "

"Positive","Apple makes great hardware but macOS is holding the Mac from being truly great and it's getting worse with each update.I'm a long-time Mac user and I've used both Mac and Windows for many years. I used to love using macOS and would always pick up my MBPs over my Windows laptops. My current Mac is a MacBook Pro 14 w/ M3 Pro. But now I've since switched almost completely to my Windows laptop (Zephyrus G14) because I've grown more and more frustrated with macOS and its limitations over the years.My first annoyance started with macOS Mojave when Apple removed 32-bit support. Back in those days, that meant I could no longer run Wine to run those small Windows programs. But looking back, this wasn't the worst decision and I actually agree with it now since it allowed Apple to remove legacy code and improve the performance of macOS in the long-run.But my first real frustraction came with macOS Catalina. This OS seemed to be the first downgrade from any major macOS release I've faced. I remember this is the first update where macOS started popping up all those ""This app would like access to your Desktop/Documents folder"", ""This app would like to Capture your Screen"", etc. and I would have to constantly open System Settings just to give access for every small permission. To this day, this feature still annoys me and is just too aggressive.It's funny cause back in the day, Apple used to roast Microsoft for being way too aggressive in its security during the Windows Vista days and now Apple has adopted the same approach lol: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqZ8AqmLPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuqZ8AqmLPY)But other than the aggressive security prompts, I also despise how Apple removed support for anti-aliasing in macOS Catalina. This made using any budget external monitor basically unuseable because all the fonts are very blurry/pixelated. I remember for a year or so, I would use this terminal command that basically somewhat brought back subpixel antialiasing but it stopped working altogether in a later macOS version. Now there are solutions like the app BetterDisplay where I can re-enable subpixel antialising but still I have to go through so many hoops just to enable a feature that should have never been removed in the first place. What pisses me off the most is that most people in Apple forums are just like ""yeah just go get yourself a 4k monitor since it plays better with Apple products."" But why should I spend so much more money on a monitor just to use with macOS when I have no issue using my 1080/1440p monitor with my Windows PCs or game consoles? These two things are just some of the issues that I've gotten disappointed with from using macOS. Here are a couple of annoyances I have:* Terrible Windows management and no Windows snapping until last year's macOS Sequoia release. And even then, it's slow and not as feature-rich as compared to Windows or third-party tools like Rectangle.* The stupid notch and the fact that there's no System Tray built-in to the menu bar. Honestly, I wouldn't even mind the notch if there way just an overflow toolbar like Windows where I can put any unneeded apps in the toolbar and expand it when I need it. There's apps like Ice and Bartender that replicate this behavior but it still expands ""into"" the bar instead of away from it. * Terrible alt+tab management. In Windows, alt+tab separates each instant of an application in its own Window. This is the way it should be imo because I only want to switch between individual apps at a time. But with macOS, every time I alt+tab, it opens all instances of that app which messes with my workflow. Sure I can do alt+\` to switch between each instance of the app but that's just so much more work on my part. I know I can also use a program like alttab to replicate Window's feel but it's not the same experience. * App compatability.

"Positive","I want to switch from iOS to Android, but I feel stuck..It all started with the Mac M1, which I think is a fantastic product. I felt it was worth investing in Apple products, so I bought an iPhone. Unfortunately, I found myself making so many compromises! Now, after two years, I'm really interested in buying the Samsung Tab S9. However, since I was already in the Apple ecosystem, I ended up purchasing the iPad Air M2 after watching countless reviews on YouTube. What a waste of money! It’s basically just a large iPhone with no additional useful features.    The worst part is that I bought it to watch movies and shows, but the experience has been disappointing due to its screen resolution—I expected better, especially since it’s not OLED. I feel like crying; I can’t explain my frustration. I primarily use my Mac and hardly touch the iPad anymore—it’s become a random book that I never read, just sitting in my cabinet.    Now, I'm looking to buy a smartwatch, but once again, I feel stuck because my best option seems to be from Apple. I have been considering the affordable Galaxy Fit 3 from Samsung, but unfortunately, it doesn’t support iOS. I don’t want to spend too much money on a smartwatch, but I keep stretching my budget, just as I did with my iPad and iPhone.    I also have other products, like Sony audio devices and a Samsung M8 monitor, and they are all working fine without any issues. Please help me break this Loop—I really want to buy the Galaxy S23 and the Tab S9 from Samsung.  "

"Positive","Mac OS.I am going to be quite honest i havent been the biggest fan of apple as far as phones and laptops are concerned for a long time especially phones compared to android. However i had the chance to use a macbook the latest m3 air. im going to be very honest unless you are a specialty user i dont see much upside for having a mac compared to windows especially for the 8 gb ram and 256gb storage is a joke for thousands of dollars (or more in foreign countries). The OS itself being a windows user for so long is nowhere near as good. I also have been using a older Intel macbook for a while same experience. Like I dont see why a University or a school student (or a regular user) would ever want to use a Apple MacBook for anything other than it being a status symbol baffles me not gonna lie."
"Positive","Apple bricked my phone.Boy oh boy. I never was the biggest Apple fan, my first phone after my flip-phone was a Samsung and eventually I grew tired of it and bought a Pixel 3, which honestly was one of the best phones I ever had. It eventually aged out and started to slow down since it was past its prime but I had it for quite a while, and when it was time for an upgrade I really didn't care for the newer pixels. Due to my insurance through my phone provider the best deal I had was with an essentially free new iphone 13, so I opted for that. I never owned an iphone before but I was familar enough with them to make my way around with it. I've had the 13 for around 3 years I guess with no issues really except for a shorter battery life then what I was used to...up until this last weekend.I realized my phone wasn't yet updated to the newest IOS update which was 17.5.1. I updated it at night and went to bed. The next day, my phone screen starts glitching, and my keyboard was not working at all when I tried typing. All of a suddden the phone completely shuts off and turns black. I could however still recieve texts and calls on it, I just could not see my screen. I tried troubleshooting all the ways I could find online, and spent hours researching what the issue could be. The next day I brought it to Best Buy to see if I could just get it fixed since I picked up the phone there after all, and the GeekSquad at mine is pretty good. The guy basically told me he saw 6 iphones THIS MONTH that had the same issue, and that I would either have to replace the screen for 350 to see if that works or talk to my phone provider about my insurance options. Luckily, my phones paid off and I have a good insurance plan that covers it with a trade-in.I got a new Iphone 14 for dirt cheap which is basically the same phone, I just can't believe I had to go through all this and pay for a new phone all because Apples update ruined my 13. Oh and I asked the people at my providers company if they've seen this issue too since they tried to fix it as well, and basically they said since the update its been happening more and more frequently. It honestly has been such a frustrating week, and I will complain to Apple until I'm at least somewhat reimbursed because this is just ridiculous. I honestly don't expect to be knowing their history but I'm pretty damn pissed and need to voice it out somewhere. All my friends with Androids I know are saying ""told you so"" and I expect the phone slowing down stuff to happen once in a while sure-I just didn't know my ENTIRE phone would become unusable.Unbelievable!!TLDR: Iphone 13 became unusable after newest IOS update and I am beyond ticked.  \*\*UPDATE\*\* Went to the apple store, they couldn't fix it and said its an issue when the phone doesn't have enough space it essentially bricks itself for anyone who said it was a non-issue. (Never had any other device do that lol) Anyway, they located me to a shop that may be able to fix it within 2-4 days. Turns out the Genius Bar is as helpful as GeekSquad."

She literally can not see how it's an upgrade, the buttons are way more sensitive so she is taking screen shots the entire time but the biggest issue is that the phones battery is terrible.I didn't believe her at first but the other day she took it off the charge at 6:30am and by 6pm it was down to 15%, she didn't even use it that much, her screen on time was about 2 hours. I googled the issue and apparently it's wide spread, literally her old phone last longer on a charge than her new one. She hates it, I asked why don't you try an android next time but she is too into the apple ecosystem to change. I was the one who said she should upgrade because I though her having USB C would help when we're are traveling and she forgets a charger.Seriously the people who like apple here, what the upgrade? She thinks that dynamic island is shit too, apart from that what is new?"
"Positive","I switched to my first iPhone from Android two months ago. Here are my thoughts and impressions (really long text).(disclaimer: this may be a bit long, but it explains my overall journey from Android to iPhone)As the title says, until 2 months ago, I was an Android user. I used Android since 2012 and throughout the years I was one of those people who thought Apple products are overpriced fancy looking devices which are outdated before they're even released and that the people using them just want to be seen as rich and trendy. I liked my Android freedom.  I liked to tinker.  To customize.  I liked to have new tech that Apple fanboys couldn't even dream of having in their iPhones.  Whenever there was a conversation about phones, I would talk about how much better Android is, especially the flagship models, compared to iPhones. And this might have been true to a degree, but I still didn't understand why so many people choose Apple over Android.But there was one Apple device that would soon change that for me. And it's not my iPhone 13 Pro. It's my 11"" M1 iPad Pro.I wanted an iPad Pro for a while, mostly so I can have a mobile drawing tablet, and after researching a lot, going back and forth with deciding if I should stick with Android and go with the Samsung Tab 7 or to just go with what has been said to be the best drawing tablet out there... I pulled the trigger and went with the iPad. And well... my mind was blown. I picked up on the gestures really fast and started loving the overall performance of the device. I was beginning to be infected with the Apple bug and wanted to see what it would be like to have an iPhone. To finally see what the big deal is with a device that is so far behind the Android competition, yet so loved.I don't change phones usually just like that. In fact, I was looking at buying a new phone ever since I got really disappointed in my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (Exynos). Samsung's lack of choice here in Europe when it comes to the chip is what ultimately made me start seriously thinking about getting an iPhone. My phone was overheating regularly last summer and I was dreading its performance this coming summer when I was planning to do some travelling and would often be out and about in the summer heat. So, here I was, infected with the Apple bug, looking at the iPhone 13 reviews. In the end I decided on the 13 Pro due to it's cameras mostly (for all those photos and videos of my travels). I didn't want the Max because it's too big for my hands. I had issues with larger phones before where it would get uncomfortable trying to get to every corner of the screen with one hand, and I wanted a device that's easy to use.My first thought after getting my phone? This thing is premium AF. It's really a mix of tech and jewellery. It explained why people like to show it off.  My second thought... this thing is so smooth.With an Android, even with a flagship, it takes some time for the device to load everything once you turn it on. The iPhone 13 Pro loads everything much faster, and there is no lag during the initial startup (a thing I was accustomed to with Android if I had many apps loading in the background). Oh and the initial setup of the device if you already have another Apple device? That was my first moment of the so called Apple magic. The seamless pairing with my iPad and my iPad's authorization of my iPhone. I knew about the iCloud and I understand how it works. It communicates with the Apple servers and does the authentication through it. But the way it's presented and how well it works... I haven't seen this level of automation yet with an Android or Windows system. I know it's because the Apple ecosystem is fairly closed one and that allows for a much more stable and smooth operation, but I wish there was something like this on the other side as well.Moving mostly everything from my Android device to my iPhone was an ok process. But there were some frustrations. I'm a WhatsApp user and I use it to talk to my girlfriend and friends. I wanted to transfer all of those conversations over. The issue is, there is no in-app way to do so. There is one for transferring from Apple to Android, but not the other way around. So I had to get a third party app that would do it for me. Here is where I was met with the first negative part of my Apple experience. There are no free apps that do that (that I could find that did the job well). So I had to pay a monthly subscription for a one-time use of an app. And I had to use my laptop to manage the transfer. It was not ideal. But once that was done, the rest of the data transfer was fairly smooth.So, after that was done, I started exploring the device. I learned gesture controls while using my iPad, so I got used to that and I knew how to work my way around the device. And in general, it seemed familiar to my iPad. There were just some minor differences.The notch. I thought it would bug me a lot, but I soon started ignoring it and didn't even notice it's there unless I was watching a video where it would poke just a bit into the video, or if I was playing a game and it would very much be there. But every other time, it would just sit there, nestled between the clock and the battery icon, minding its own business, while my real focus was centered on the content underneath it.Texting and typing in general is a bit different on the iPhone when compared to an Android device. They keyboard is fairly limited, there is no number row on the top on the default iOS keyboard, and if I would like to use a period or comma symbol, I have to go to the symbols section of the keyboard, instead of it being easily available to me on the main keyboard. I did later learn that I can just swipe from the symbols key to those, but it's a bit of an annoyance and needs some time for the muscle memory to learn that.Limited customization is real. I say limited because Apple does allow for some customization, but it's not user friendly at all. I know that before iOS 14, there was no way to customize icons or color schemes, so I'm glad that it's an option now. But... it is still really limited and clunky. I tried to customize my home screen, but I really didn't like Apple's Shortcuts workaround for icon changes. Every time I would try to open an app, it would first open Safari, and then would switch to the app itself. It was really jarring and would take me out of the experience like it's constantly reminding me that this is not exactly how Apple wants me to use my device.And when it comes to searching for apps for customization, almost everything costs money in the app store. As I learned with my WhatsApp transfer ordeal, most apps that would be free on the Google app store, cost money on the Apple app store. The same thing happened here. If I wanted to download a theme, I had to buy a subscription for an app that provides that. Unless I wanted to go create everything in the Shortcuts app, but as much as I like to tinker, I just wanted an easy solution.When comparing it to Samsung's theme store, Samsung is way ahead of Apple there. I hope Apple will do better one day.But, there are some neat features when it comes to customization that I really like with iPhone and I wish Android could learn from. Mainly, profiles. I immediately fell in love with them and use them daily. I have my work profile which activates at the start of my work day and de-activates at the end of my work day. When I connect a game controller to my iPhone, my gaming profile activates. When it's time for bed, my night time profile activates. All of them have custom home screens with apps that are fitting for the profile in use. My work profile has my work apps, my gaming one has my games, and so on. It's really neat.Widgets are nice, but nothing to write home about, as Android has them done in a much better way. I do like how you can stack widgets though.I don't mind the Settings page that much, even though I know it hasn't changed since forever. Even on Android, I used the search bar to find the setting I was looking for, I almost never scroll through it to find something. But that's just my particular use case.And speaking of search bars, the overall search function that iOS has is so good, as I can search for anything by just pulling down a bit on the home screen and it searches not only through my device, but also online. So I have no need for a dedicated search like on Android where I would have to have the Google search widget through which I would search for stuff online, and if I wanted to search for something on my device, I would have to go to the app menu to do so. Apple's solution is so much better and it's fully integrated.The app menu though... I do have some issues with it, as it groups apps on its own and I can't sort them alphabetically. And the grouping is sometimes a hit or miss. For instance, it sometimes can't differentiate between two food delivery apps, and puts one in the ""Food and Delivery"" group, while the other ends up in ""Other"" group. I wish we could customize that at least and change where the app should go, if we can't have alphabetical sorting.But now comes the most important focus for me. The performance. As I mentioned before, my Samsung device was overheating and it would throttle the performance like crazy. This would happen while using my phone for navigation, gaming, and sometimes (depending on the ambient temperature) even just browsing. I like to use my phone as a pocket computer, which means I use it for almost anything when I'm out and about, and I tend to use it heavily. I want to be able run the most resource demanding apps, pair it with accessories, even use it as a small computer by pairing a mouse and a keyboard to it.And I'm happy to say that the iPhone 13 Pro is a great device for such use. It handled anything I threw at it, while my Android device would sometimes struggle. Not to mention, the camera system is really good and snappy. I can literally just point my phone at what I'm trying to capture and in less than a second, the photo is already saved. That is something my S20 FE could never do, it always needed a second or two to capture a single image. So when I travelled to London a few weeks ago, I was confident that I can take as many photos and videos as I want and that it will all look great and that my device won't hang up on the camera process or even sometimes not take the photo because the image processing software was acting up.The battery is another important part that I'm really happy with. The phone can last the whole day with fairly heavy use and I almost never had to use my portable battery pack to top it off before the end of the day, even in situations where I would record and take photos for hours.And lastly, gaming. Before I used my S20 FE, I used a Sony Xperia, which had a Snapdragon chip and gaming on it was a good experience, but eventually, the touch inputs on that device started acting up and I learned it was a common defect. I had hoped that using Samsung would be a better experience, but unfortunately, Exynos was a huge letdown and couldn't handle some of the more advanced games I like to play like Genshin Impact or Asphalt 9. With the iPhone, I have no issues there. I can play Genshin for prolonged periods of time with the device barely breaking a sweat, which is really impressive. And I do connect a Razer Kishi controller to it for a Switch like experience, which makes my phone my favourite mobile gaming device.At the end of it all, has my experience been positive since making the switch? Mostly yes. There were some hiccups, for instance my Samsung Buds Pro not having official support on iOS, and I can only use them as normal bluetooth earphones without almost any extra functionality that they come with, but that's mostly on Samsung and their software. But while there were some small growing pains, 2 months in, I'm really happy with the device and my use of it is only getting better. Not to mention that the phone is learning how I use it and slowly adapts to me, which is what a proper smartphone should do.I do wish that Apple would add certain features such as Apple Pencil support to the device. I have it with my iPad, so why can't I use it with my iPhone as well? I also wish the customization would be simpler and that it wouldn't all cost extra money just to apply a skin or to change a ringtone.But in general, yes, I'm happy with my switch, and I plan to expand my Apple ecosystem eventually.I hope this was somewhat insightful for anyone in a similar position and thanks for reading, if you came to the end.Edit:TL;DR  After 10 years of Android use I switched to Apple. My journey started with an iPad and then I moved to the iPhone 13 Pro. While there are some caveats and hiccups during the initial setup, my overall experience has been a positive one and as a power user, I'm happy about my purchase, but there are some things I wish Apple would improve upon."
"Positive","After 12 years with android its time to give Apple another go (2 weeks later).Pic of [setup](https://imgur.com/a/8Vs0U2q)Hello, some of you may have seen my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/115py24/after_12_years_with_android_its_time_to_give/) where i showed my switch to iphone and talked a bit about why i decided to give IOS a go. It has now been 2 weeks so i wanted to share my experience with switching to a new ecosystem as a long time android user. *Warning its a long post***Airpods pro (Good things)**- Legit the best earbuds i have tried so far, ive used earbuds from samsung, sennheiser, jabra and sony and overall i think apple makes the best. Sennheiser is a good second.- Comfort is top notch and i can wear them for hours without problems and they sit pretty sturdy even with a fast bike ride.- Noice canceling is next level, everytime i wear them i feel like im wearing a helmet where all noise are mostly gone with only my music left.  - Switching between my watch, ipad and iphone is seamless and super easy.**(bad things about the airpods)**- THEY ARE SLIPPERY AS HELL. Legit never dropped earbuds as many times as i have with this single product. - They have a weird glitch sometimes where one earbud will suddenly just be a little more louder than the other. They ususally go back to normal on their own but still annoying.- This is a nitpick. I hate the color, i wish they were black since the white gets scratched easily and they are super visible. **Apple watch (Good things)**- The design of the watch is perfect. I think apple made the right choice sticking with this design and just improving it each year. Its light, looks great and the watch faces makes it seem like a natural watch. - Battery has been great! I checked apples website and they promise 18 hours of use so i was prepared to charge everyday around 22 but i was generally surprised to see i could get almost 2 days of use out of them before they needed to be charged and that is with sleep tracking. - Fitness features are more refined than on android. On my galaxy watch 4 after a 15 minutes run on treadmill on 15 km/hr it would rate my heartrate at 199 which is maximum which would put me at a horrible shape. The apple watch rated my heartrate at a more believable 169. Overall its also much easier to use and more fun as navigation is fluid and workouts are motivated with rings and medals. **(bad things about apple watch)**- Sleep tracking should have more information and also give me some kind of rating whether im sleeping right or not. **Iphone (good things)**- Love the design, the boxy flat screen is just great and feels so good to hold (insert joke). - Apps are much better optimized on apple and even the gym app i use is a WHOLE DIFFERENT app on iphone compared to android which is kind of annoying but at least i can use the better version now. - I play a lot of games on phone (dont judge me) and for some reason i want to play even more on my iphone. Maybe its for nostalgic reasons cuz i used to have an ipod touch where i spend all day playing on it. - The processor is fast and more importantly ITS COOL on a few androids i have had i always experience a lot of heat from the back of the device when used intensely, on iphone i only experience this when im charging.- Switching over my whatsapp and messages/contacts was much easier than it used to be (for context i switched from an s21 ultra) all my stuff was there and ready to be used. The backup and restore feature on iphone is also much better. I had to return the first iphone i bought cuz it had a dead pixel i noticed a little late so i was given a new one, when i came home and set it up using the backup from the first iphone it had all my stuff ready with widgets and appdata (like i never left) and only needed a password or 2 for my mails. - Face ID is such a nice feature to have in the cold since i dont need to remove my gloves to get into my device. I just need to hold it up to my face. - Delightful haptics**(bad things about Iphone)**- Battery life has been decent but its not great for heavy use. I can kill it using it from 7 in the morning to 21 in the evening which is decent but doesn´t beat my s21 ultra which usually had 30% left after the same day so could still go out (but makes sense with the bigger body).- Charging is slow, it takes about 2 hours from 15 to 100 where i was so used to charging my devices full in 58 minutes. - The size of the phone is a bit too small for my liking, i find myself not enjoying scrolling webpages or watching something as much as i used to. I did try the iphone 14 pro max but that device IS WAY TOO BIG and apple does not use that space more efficient. Everything on the pro max just looks like an iphone 14 pro zoomed in instead of giving me more icons on my homescreen or having the option to do splitscreen. For some reason i think my s21 ultra is easy to hold and use while the pro max is heavy and hard to hold. I think its because apple focused on making the pro max wider and heavier while samsung focused on taller and slimmer. I think samsungs approach is the right one.- Transfering data is a pain. I really do not like itunes, since it only regonized very few file types and im forced to use third party apps to transfer alot of movies and some important documents i keep on me. Androids drag and drop is just so much simplier.- File types on Iphone are a mess, as a student i usually have to open a lot of different file types i get send or the instructor put out for us. Iphone seems to have issues regonizing some filetypes and i even had to google how to open a PDF on iphone. Turns out i could either pay a monthly fee for an app or insert the pdf into the books app where i then can open to view content. Which is pretty annoying overall as there are many times where on android i can pretty much read and save anything i want from the web. - Iphone can be boring at times, i do miss being able to customize my device by redoing my whole homescreen or changing launcher or fiddling with widgets i can make myself. On iphone you get what you have, and it becomes a bit boring looking at the same homescreen after a while (though this is more of a personal note since most dont really care).- Lack of emulators is also a factor why iphone can be boring, there are so many interesting apps you can get on android that just does not exist on iphone. As i mentioned before i play a lot of games on my phone where emulators is a big part of that. I used to play PS1, N64 and snes all on the go on my samsung where i just dont have the same options on iphone unless i do some weird workaround that only works for 7 days. - Siri is useless, enough said. - Reminders isnt really helpful, as on android i can go ""hey google, remind me to pick up my tickets on tuesday at 13"" and then at tuesday 12 i would get a notification reminding me of that where iphone dont remind me with notification it just shows a plus one on my reminders app. - Apple lightning port is super annoying (nitpick) since with ipad it uses USB C and everything else i own uses USB C. I normally only have 1 USB C cable near my desk to charge everything but due to iphone i now need to have 2 even when i leave for UNI or work. - Notifications are a mess, sometimes i get notified other times i dont and it only groups notifications after when i recieved them. So i usually miss a few things since they get buried under the other new notifications i get where on android i can see them all at once. Phew, that was a long post but i wanted to be thorough with my points.So the big question after all of this is ""will i keep moving forward with apple?"" And the answer is....... prob not.There are too much i miss from android where i feel like apple is a fresh new place i explored vs coming home to android where i feel at ease. As exciting as it has been using apple the back of my head have that feeling of ""when am i going back home (android)"" which is a shame cuz i did enjoy using em.I will keep using my airpods pro and ipad (cuz android tablets are shit) but in a month or two im gonna sell my iphone for 90% of the cost and get me a s23 plus. The apple watch will be a gift for someone.  If you have any questions feel free to ask."
"Positive","Long time Android user, now back to iPhone after 12 years.Just some thoughts and rambling~Back in 2012, I rocked the original iPhone 5 but noticed how limited it was (mostly hardware wise) compared to the Android offerings at the time. Android options offered more internal storage, optional microSD cards, larger screen offerings, more RAM, and more customization options. I was sold, switched in 2013, and didn’t look back…until now. Over the last decade I jumped and upgraded to various phones (Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Note 4,  LG G4, LG V10, V20, Samsung S10, and lastly the Pixel 7 Pro). Ironically enough after 12 years with Android, the Pixel 7 Pro, Google’s own brand of Android phones, nudged me to jump back over to iPhone. For starters, I enjoyed my Pixel 7 Pro for the most part. The camera system was mostly excellent, Magic Eraser worked nearly flawlessly in most situations, I loved the giant screen, and the Screen My Call function is super handy. But the random corner cutting drove me absolutely crazy. A phone marketed as a “premium” phone should not have this level of cost cutting. While nothing was glaringly bad (well mostly), it felt like “death by a million cuts”. The biggest issue was Google for whatever reason cheaped out on the modem and SoC. It’s pretty telling when Samsung doesn’t even want to use their own modem. And the Tensor SoC overheating and draining issues were all over the place. Calls would randomly drop, the signal status would randomly flail like a fish out of water, and it seemed that if the cell signal wasn’t near perfect, it would just fail to acquire and keep a consistent signal. Meanwhile my iPad would just happily stay connected with a modest signal strength. Data and speeds worked perfectly fine. My cheap old work cell phone (a Samsung something) holds a signal better than my $900 Pixel 7 Pro. It’s a smartphone…it’s paramount that it holds a signal and does this particular job well. The software felt very “patchy”. The fact that you **must** have a Google search bar front and center on your home screen (not removable) is super tacky IMO. Sporadic graphics and UI glitches would plague nearly every corner of the phone. From simple swiping to rotating the screen to just exiting an app would cause random artifacts or brief freezing. Not to the point where the phone was obviously defective, but like it had to think for a second what I was trying to get it to do. My background is in IT, so I’ve done all the usual and reasonable troubleshooting steps. But just randomly searching online, these issues were not unique. And I get it, sometimes new products have bugs and issues that are eventually ironed out in future updates or revisions. But nope, I put up with it for nearly 2 years and the issues persist. (with some new ones added in!)I also travel a lot, so having a smartphone I didn’t (and couldn’t) have complete confidence in was unnerving to say the least. > Well why not switch to Samsung? Because I feel that Samsung has become a less refined version of Google…In addition to that, the preloaded apps which now some you can’t even disable, much less uninstall, is absolutely ridiculous, especially on flagship models. If I’m paying $1000+ for a phone, I want to have complete control over what optional apps are installed and running…Sure it may be “good enough” for most. But I’m not paying $1000+ for “good enough”. The final nail in the coffin was a set of particular ads I recently started getting. I have sort of a unique neurological condition in which I have never typed, searched, or had any written communication about in regards to my phone or Google account. Again my background is an IT, and I’m very familiar with and take several precautions to protect my privacy, especially my health information. Google somehow figured out (or made a really good guess) at what this health condition was and linked it back to me. And felt it was perfectly okay to start shoving ads down my throat about it. To say the least I felt pretty violated. I understand ads are just a part of life now and will probably be around till the end of time.But this struck a really, really bad chord with me…At that point I was done with Android.I remember reading throughout the years Apple’s stance on privacy. Most data processing is done on your Apple device where possible, their refusal to build a backdoor for the FBI, end-to-end encryption, and the fact how far iPhone/iOS has come since 2012. Long(er) story short, I bought an iPhone 15 Pro Max and so far I’ve been pretty happy with it. The privacy controls, ecosystem integration, and consistency is near flawless. And the ads from third party apps have been so wildly unrelated to me, which makes me happy lolAnyway, sorry for the long ramble, just a kudos to those at Apple for sticking to their design functionality and ethics.

"Positive","Demanding Real iPhone Innovation, Usability, and Honesty: An Open Letter to Tech Giants.Hey fellow tech enthusiasts,I'm writing this open letter not just as a voice of frustration but also as an iPhone owner who genuinely wants to see change for the better. It's time for us, the consumers, to demand real innovation, meaningful improvements, and honesty from the tech industry.Coming from the Android ecosystem, I find myself missing the smooth keyboard experience of the Pixel, but I'm disappointed by the lack of innovation from Google. After patiently waiting for years for industry standards to develop, I expected more from the iPhone. I've never been particularly fond of the front camera, as it seems more about surveillance and eavesdropping than anything truly meaningful - (eye)Phone. Today's technology allows for hidden camera features like those in lesser-known brands, and I believe Apple could incorporate this tech for the greater good. They could license the technology and improve privacy.The suggestive and predictive text input feels outdated, like something from the 90s, and it's frustrating to have such a poor typing experience. The phone lacks evident full search capabilities, and the old-fashioned dial pad with no option to customize button placement, especially on larger form factors like the iPhone 15 Pro Max, is baffling.It seems both Apple and Google are resting on their laurels without delivering meaningful advancements. While I appreciate camera improvements, I'm left wondering about voice and call quality in a post-1G, 2G, and 3G era. It's increasingly challenging to maintain clear calls while traveling, even though we had basic audio quality in the past. If 5G is supposed to be superior, why hasn't call clarity improved, especially when today's phones support all carrier bands and frequencies?The browser UI lacks full gesture control, which is disappointing compared to what the Pixel offers. I expected more innovation from Apple. My productivity has suffered due to frequent and often unnecessary changes from one iOS version to another. The controls for navigating app pages are cumbersome, with back button controls favoring left-handed users.This is why I'm disappointed with the new Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Hearing that the iPhone 14 is better and seeing fans defending the product while discrediting honest reviewers is disheartening. We must be more critical in our opinions to ensure products don't become overpriced and less advanced.Where are the software, OS, and UI innovations compared to the Pixel? Google, too, has been lackluster in terms of ergonomic and dynamic usability features, leaving me disappointed with their lack of effort. If simplicity and customization are challenging for their employees, they could consider using AI, like ChatGPT, to help code these minor improvements quickly.In conclusion, there don't seem to be reasonable excuses for these products' rising costs when there's little meaningful improvement for users. Where is the greatness? I'm extremely disappointed with the product and hope others can voice their concerns so that we receive an iOS update that shows the company still cares about staying on the cutting edge.If fundamental concepts like these were embraced, someone like Elon Musk could create a smartphone that outshines the appeal of both Apple and Google, erasing the presumed leadership and perceived industry experience advantages they currently hold. However, it's essential to understand that these advantages are meaningless if genuine innovation isn't prioritized as the utmost goal for their future endeavors. It's becoming increasingly apparent that complacency and unwarranted hubris are leading them down a swift path towards decline. As an ordinary individual, I'm willing to speak candidly for the greater good, and I can't be the only one recognizing this trend.I've taken the step to share my concerns because I believe that by doing so, I can help shape a future where technology truly enhances our lives. I encourage you to share your thoughts, too, because together, we can compel meaningful change.&#x200B;1. **Speak Up for Better Stuff:** Don't just say you love something. Say, ""Make it better!"" Let's ask for improvements.2. **A Not-So-Happy iPhone User:** I used to like iPhones, but now I'm not so sure. I want to help make them better for everyone.3. **Good Value for Our Money:** We work hard for our money, so we want tech that's worth it. We don't need miracles, just good value.4. **Be Honest About What You Sell:** Some times, new things aren't really better. Tech companies should tell the truth instead of saying what they feel is needed to get their next paycheck the employees should be more concerned about what the buyer thinks than their boss.5. **Share Your Thoughts Honestly:** Everyone should say what they really think. It's not just for fan groups. Share your complaints and ideas.6. **We're All in This Together:** We're all customers, and we all want tech that makes life easier. When we speak up, we help each other.7. **Customers Have Power:** People who buy stuff have a lot of power. We can make tech companies listen to us.8. **Share Your Thoughts:** Join the conversation and share what you think. This letter is for all of us who want better tech.9. **Easy Phone Screens:** Phones should be easy to use and work for left and right-handed people.10. **Phones Should Be Easy:** Phones should be easy for everyone to use. Buttons should be in the right place, and we should change how they look.11. **Listen to Users:** Companies should listen to us and make things better. No more excuses!12. **Stop Being So Greedy:** Some tech companies care more about money than making good stuff. They should care about us.13. **Make Things Faster and Easier:** Tech can be slow and hard. Fix it to make our lives easier.14. **Make Tech Look and Work Well:** Tech should look good and work for everyone.15. **Be Honest About Prices and Quality:** We want to know how much things cost and how good they are.16. **We Want Real Improvements:** We're tired of buying things that aren't really better. Tech companies should make new and better things, not just sell more of the same.Share your thoughts on these issues, and let's continue the conversation to drive change in the tech industry. Together, we can compel tech giants to prioritize what truly matters: technology that enhances our lives."
"Positive","My thoughts about making the switch finally to the iPhone in the future.Let me tell you what's going on in my head right now but with what I really feel(Think of it like the temperature and feels like part), so here goes: 1. Being a lifetime user, it is common sense to stick to your roots rather than switching. But, the apple ecosystem is mature enough now for me to consider it. Plus, it is not good to think of one system as better than the other. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. But since I have never used an iPhone, I can't say much about it. As far as I've heard and seen, the ecosystem really reels you in to a point where getting out seems very tough but at the same time awesome due to hardcore integration of every device with each other. 2. Customization plays an important role. Everyone wants to look good in real life so why not make your phone look different from everyone else. Practical thinking. Butttt, there comes a time when you get bored of changing everything again and again. Nowadays, launchers like Niagara(Current Launcher)do a great job of keeping everything minimal and reachable in 2 taps maximum. It might seem boring at first but it is a no nonsense way to minimalism. Widgets play an important role in the lives of some people not all. Most if us only change the main widget i.e. the time and date and that too not that often. The people around me don't even do that. But, I'd rather have it and not need it rather than needing it and not having it. Basic customization only not extreme. Still not that big of a deal for me except for launchers ofcourse. 3. Goodlock is an app that transforms the basic elements of OneUi into something which others only dream of. It is sometimes the only app that makes users stick to Samsung. This app is a godsend for Samsung users. 4. Security is a big thing nowadays. Android and IOS are secure but if I talk about companies, people tend to think about multiple ones such as Xiaomi, Realme, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus. Just speaking about android, each company has it's own security embedded inside their respective phones. In case of Samsung, we have Knox. For a company that is in multiple businesses and not just smartphones, it is understandable that their security would be better than their chinese counterparts. I don't know how deep the security hole goes but personally speaking I haven't seen any Samsung owner say that their data is not being protected enough. And yes I know IOS is more secure overall. If I am wrong please correct me. 5. Longevity of the phone matters a lot nowadays because companies are bringing new innovations like drops of water instead of even a glass. Due to this, people have started keeping their phones beyond 2 years. I've personally seen 3 to 4 years myself. Many people I know have their Samsungs working in tip top condition. Yet, here am I with a Note 10 plus that stutters and lags sometimes but it is visible every now and then. I've seen people recommend a clean reset but why do it in the first place. Why can't the phone keep performing in a normal way. Whats the point of owning a phone almost worth 1100 to 1200 dollars when after 2 years you get a recommendation of resetting it. Yes, I have many apps but that's what the 256 gigs is for. That's what 12 gb of RAM is for. I know the performance has not reduced drastically and there have been improvements in OneUi but it is still present and will be visible to most users someday if not yet. Recently, the Swipe gestures are really starting to go haywire. Sometimes I am unable to close the keyboard and sometimes the device just stops responding and stays like that for a long time no idea why. 6. Processor is another issue for the people outside USA. Exynos is what A(1-14) is to Apple. But, that's where the similarities end. Forget about comparing it with Apple, it is inferior compared to even Snapdragon. Yet, we pay the same or more for it. It might be overlooked by some and even me but there is a limit. Once or twice is ok but everytime is a BIG NO. 7.  The screen is a big deal when it comes to content consumption. Samsung makes the best screen no doubt about it. iPhones are not far behind though so not an issue there except for the notch. But, I've gotten used to even seeing it in Videos so I won't have a problem I think. 8. OneUi looks great and so does the upcoming Android 12. Samsung always goes a few steps further to incorporate bonus features which is good. But, have you ever seen how Ios looks in general. There is some class in it that I haven't seen in OneUi. From the unique blur to the vivid nature of the OS, there is a sense of Wow even seeing it. I used #hex installer as an overall customization software that changes literally everything. I used it for 4 months I guess and then just gave up because simplicity always wins in the end and I was trying to satisfy myself by going in the opposite direction. I felt happy but somewhere along the way I forgot that an Os is not something that you keep on customizing till it is not possible to customize it anymore but rather a medium for communication between man and machine and the simpler it is the better it is. 9. I've tried the ecosystem thing with Samsung and it has gotten better over the years but as everyone knows the truth I won't say much. I'll just say that there comes a time when you think about your purchases and how they affected your life in a positive way. My Note does not work with Windows at all. I wont use it even if it worked because I am not accustomed to that continuity. My Gear S3 and Active are collecting dust as I type. I want to use them but I dont need them as they don't and won't have an affect on my day to day activities. I never thought once that this watch is an extension of my phone. Yes, I got all the notification, all my health data was synced, I used to customize the face everyday and yet it was a want and not a need. This is my personal experience and yours may vary completely. 10. Updates are a major part of every experience. People want the latest asap. Whether it is a 1900 to 2000 dollar phone like the Fold or a phone worth 300 dollars, the wait is inversly proportional to the year of release except for Pixels. No issue on Ios. Ios 15. Sure have it on your 6s but with slightly less features please. Thank you. 11. Oh my Bloatware. So much so that it feels like I am using Youtube non premium with dual non skippable ads. I also have an A50s which I don't know why I bought. But I switch it on recently. Brace yourself now. First thing I did was go to the Galaxy Store to update the first batch of Samsung apps before going to the play store to update the non Samsung apps. I pulled down the notification panel and saw something updating which I am pretty sure I never downloaded. I thought it was just one app that I might have downloaded accidentally. I stopped it from downliading and uninstalled it. Again, I saw another app doing the same thing. I repeated this step 8 times fyi. I guess they were promotional apps of some sort embedded inside another app. I checked my apps after the first app for any more apps of such kind but there were none. This means that the apps were downloading by themselves. I don't even wanna talk about ads. That is another long paragraph of bullshit. 12. Many app store options on Android. FOSS apps on F droid, etc, ApkMirror and what not. Yes, I have gotten apps for free and saved a ton of money but is it a solution to download the app again when an update to the app arrives. Moreover, now I am mature enough to understand from a developers POV that any app that is paid should not be downloaded as an Apk just for the sake of saving money which the developer could've gotten and made the app even better for us, the very people who misuse the openness of Android. Hence, the reason why apps on Ios are a lot better. I know this is just one side of the story but we should not misuse the freedom given to us in such a way that it affects another persons hardwork. 13. Battery life is something that goes overlooked in Android in the long run. Bigger batteries do not mean more hours of usage always. It does in some cases but currently my phone just gulps battery like it is nothing. I can get a day out of my phone if I want but that means limiting my usage. On some days, you get amazing Screen on times and then on some days you have to turn on ultra power saving mode which turns your 1000 dollar phone into a big Feature phone. 14. Camera is one of the most important feature nowadays. It has gotten so much better over the years that now it's just a matter of who has more features. Ofcourse quality of a photo or video matters. Samsung tends to oversarurate everything which some people like and some dont. Plus, Samsung has a plus point of giving the owner numerous features that gimmick or not are just worth a look atleast if not more. Personally, I don't mind a slightly inferior camera but since I haven't changed brands, I've had a similar experience in terms of overall output but the difference is very much noticeable. 15. Ease of use is another minor problem for me personally. Stock Android is easy to use. On the other hand, OneUi is filled with menus after menus after menus. Even if I don't want to touch anything, my curiosity takes over. There have been some instances where I changed something and the next time I wanted to go back to the default setting, I would get confused just locating the specific setting again. So, I just installed Niagara Launcher and that is it for me now. No more #hex or fiddling with settings whatsoever. In the end, I would like to say that even though I love Android, I also love Ios. They are both awesome in their own ways. They are different but similar in many ways. Competitive yet forgiving. One person may like Ios and another may like Android. In the end, it's the ease of use, freedom and privacy that are the key pillars of an OS. Both have achieved so much in theirespective generations that it seems like a revolution almost. For me, Android is like my current house and Ios like a new house where I will move to this year. It will be a new journey, a new story and a new chapter of my life and it will be cherished no matter what people say. I am a fanboy yes and a big one but of technology and will not stop loving it ever because these electronics were my best friends when I had nobody to talk to. They are an extension of who and what I am and somewhere they played a huge role in shaping me and making me believe that the world is in the palm of your hands and it's the same world but two different parallel roads with a divider of hate created by us humans for one side. I stuck with Samsung till now because it did more than what I asked for and even though the Software became laggy after a year and a half or so, it still has so many features that just make the experience more than enough and Samsung will never stop surprising us with new ones. This kind of cancels out the lag part completely for me.But, I cannot just ignore the dark side. It may not have the features that I have now but I will adapt along with others because adaptation is something we are very good at. I am excited about the journey ahead and since I have 2 roads, I can just switch if I don't like something. This is my story. One which has many chapters ahead. Next chapter will be Ios. I'll only say that do not think of Ios or Android as enemies but think of them as two ways of interaction with the wonderful world. You might like one over the other but both have the same core purpose i.e. to make your life better."
"Positive","I'm not disappointed by the iPhone 4S, and here's why....So the announcement today has obviously left many people disappointed with Apple and not sure what their next phone is going to be. We were all (myself included) hoping for a major redesign that would shock and awe like the iPhone 4 did last year (even though Gizmodo let the cat out of the bag a little early). But after the keynote today, I was content to know that the iPhone 4S will be my next phone, hopefully on October the 14th! Here's why I'm not disappointed (in order from biggest to smallest issue):* Siri! This will change the way I use my phone. To be able to have my text messages and emails read to me while I am driving, and be able to respond with only my voice is something that I've been searching for for a while. Android sort of does this, but it is not integrated like it is on the 4S. Browsing through all the things that you can say is incredible. Integration with Wolfram Alpha was genius I think, as what you can ask is now basically limitless. ASSUMING this works as well as we have been led to believe it will, killer feature.* Design. One of the major reasons that people wanted to see the iPhone '5' was for an external redesign. Granted, those mockups and renderings and especially that physical prototype that was made all looked really slick - if somewhat impractical technologically. Maybe we will see that next year, or later down the line, but I don't know how it would be possible to stuff everything that is in the 4S into something with much less volume. The mockups had it just slightly wider, actually shorter, and much thinner, meaning less volume. So something would have to give - probably battery life from a smaller battery. And honestly - though it is about 16 months old, the iPhone 4/4S design is still the most gorgeous smartphone on the market by far! The glass and metal is a timeless design, and I personally am not ready to be bored of it yet. * Data. Despite not being branded as one, the iPhone 4S is a 4G phone in exactly the same sense that the Motorla Atrix 4G, HTC Inspire 4G, and LG Thrill 4G are 4G phones. Keep in mind, this is HSDPA, and only carries improvements for AT&T customers in the US. Now, I don't think those phones should be branded 4G phones, but they do have potential for faster download speeds than regular HSPA phones, and now the iPhone does too! Real world performance may be different, but it is nice to know that the iPhone's theoretical data speed has been doubled - that is a big deal!* Camera. The camera on the iPhone 4 was the best cell phone camera ever when it came out IMO. The iPhone 4S' camera? The new best. Don't be fooled into thinking that the example shots up on Apple's site are fake or 'shopped or whatever else. I achieved perfectly comprable (and incredible) pictures with my iPhone 4 next to their sample pictures last year, and I expect the same this year out of the 4S. The camera is going to be awesome, and the addition of 1080P with stabilization on the video front makes it even more enticing. * Speed. My iPhone 4 was as snappy as the day I bought it when I sold it two days ago. An improvement on that speed (up to 2x) without hurting battery life is going to be awesome. For everything to be even more responsive is going to make this phone feel extremely fresh. Graphics performance I'm sure will be awesome too, though I don't play many games.* (EDIT) Screen. Forgot to add this part when I first typed. A lot of the issue apparently is with the screen size. It is a non-issue to me, though I know many people wanted a bigger screen. First of all - a bigger screen means scaling for apps - the .5 million apps out there already aren't designed for a 4"" screen. Even if the pixel count was the same on the 4"" screen (pushing the PPI below 'Retina' doesn't matter, in reality, because it would still look awesome), all of those apps have not been designed for a 4"" screen. Size would be off, and not as the developers intended. It would be a year before there was a considerable number of apps converted or made new for this phone. I much prefer a large ecosystem over a slightly smaller screen. Also, I think 3.5"" works great for one handed use, especially when compared to some of the really large Android phones out there. For me, despite the onslaught of large-screened devices in the last couple years, a 3.5"" display with iOS on it is just as useful as it was on every iPhone before this one. It might not be bigger than the competitors, but I don't think bigger necessarily is better for a cell phone. Basically what it comes down to is that this is the iPhone 5 we were expecting, just without the improbably thin case design. We will get there eventually, but I really think that the combination of powerful new software in Siri and iOS 5 paired with beautiful, thin, and light hardware makes the iPhone 4S the best phone on the market. So r/iphone, who agrees or disagrees with me? I'm all caught up in the iPhone day excitement, let's discuss below."
"Positive","My take on the iPhone Xs vs Pixel 3.I know this is a choice most people are considering right now and since I'm up for an upgrade (previous owner of iPhone 3G, 5S, Samsung Note 5, and currently Galaxy S8), I decided to go out and purchase both phones and test both out before returning one. For full disclosure, I left iPhone after the 5s because I became so bored of Apple’s dull iOS and at the time, they continually released phones that were behind in specs but cost more than their Android competitors. I found Samsung’s approach to Android refreshing while tolerating the departure from Apple’s ecosystem. I’m currently using the Galaxy S8 but I have found the camera to be lacking in low light situations and the downward firing speaker to be a huge frustration when sharing media with friends. I haven’t decided which phone I’ll keep just yet but I wanted to share my my honest experience of using both over the past few days. I don’t believe I have a bias towards either and that is what is keeping me from making a final decision but it’s up to each consumer’s needs and priorities.**BUILD**iPhone Xs| One of the best builds in the industry. Glass sandwich and stainless steel edges scream luxury and are part of what the $1,000 price tag are all about. The width and weight of the phone can be tiring for normal sized hands and put a serious strain on your pinky if you use it to hold the phone up. While the materials are of quality it also feels like a phone that is easy to drop or damage and you can’t help but feel the need for a case to feel confident in using it out in public. Camera bump is annoying when you lay it down on a table. Pixel 3|The regular Pixel 3 feels great in the hand. It’s light enough that it doesn’t strain your hand. The quality of materials feels premium but is simple enough that you feel confident bringing it out of your pocket without a case. I haven’t found the “scratching” controversy to be an issue as long as you don’t keep the phone in pockets with keys or coins. **DISPLAY**iPhone Xs|An incredible screen even with the notch. The notch disappears after even 15 minutes of use and isn’t that much of a eyesore since iOS doesn’t use the upper space for notifications. Colors are deep and the controls for True Tone where colors are duplicated differently depending on ambient light are a nice feature. This is a great display to consume all kinds of media with and is easy to use outdoors.Pixel 3|This is a compact but beautiful screen. Colors are vivid and I much prefer the smaller Pixel’s screen to the XL’s ugly notch that interferes with notifications. I have no issue with the 1080P resolution compared to larger 4K screens. It feels premium and I don’t feel that the LG panel is any less refined than Samsung’s panels on their own phone or iPhone. I didn’t find the display to be too dim outside and when checking to see the brightness level in direct sunlight, 80% brightness was plenty.**OPERATING SYSTEM**iPhone Xs|iOS has come a long way since I used the iPhone 5S. I still own an iPad but the way gestures work on the phone is actually quite nice. Navigating around the OS is very smooth and snappy. Generally speaking, the refinement of apps for iOS is special with every developer obviously sending their absolute best for users. The integration across programs with Apple services is definitely convenient and in particular iMessage and Facetime.Pixel 3|This is my first time on pure Android and as I turn on my Galaxy S8 with the Samsung Experience, I have to say it is so much better. The fluid quickness makes doing work so easy. Generally, I find Android far more minimal in its experience but that lets your work be more important than the interaction with the operating system. However, I have to point out that Android feels far more like a beta release, with some gestures feeling awkward and certain customizations are missing compared to Samsung or One Plus (shouldn’t pure Android be the *most* customizable??). It’s obvious that Google wants to turn pure Android Pie into the parallel for iOS and they still have some ways to go until it’s that elegant. **BATTERY PERFORMANCE**iPhone Xs|I have really solid battery performance on the Xs. Even after a morning of intense use and phone calls, I’m just falling under 78%. Facetime drains the battery much more but those types of calls tend to happen while I’m near a charger so it doesn’t bother me as much. Pixel 3|The phone is obviously smaller than the Xs and it takes a hit on battery in comparison. While it is slightly more efficient than my 1.5 year old Galaxy S8, it can easily drop to the low 70s or even high 60s after a heavy morning. Brightness has a major effect on battery drain. Heavy use will require a top off in the later part of the day. **CAMERA**iPhone Xs|The camera is solid for most users but if you care about details, there are things lacking here. Regular photos tend to be flatter and less sharp than the Pixel. Coloring is often too warm and low light processing doesn’t always produce an attractive outcome. The camera really does well with tons of ambient light but when that isn’t there, expect a good amount of over saturation and loss of detail. Portrait mode often misses edges and lacks depth. The video camera and the audio it records is simply the best available in the industry. Pixel 3|Before I get to the still shoot camera, I have to say the video is often too washed out and the audio is absolutely atrocious. While I know many will say the audio can be repaired with a software update, it’s unacceptable for this kind of mistake at the premium price point they’re using. Even when I’ve heard the AR audio people talk about, it doesn’t come close to Apple’s recording quality. On the other side, the still shoot camera is literally the best in the industry. While photos are often noticeably cool with visible blue tones, the way Google’s software processes images is incredible. Portrait mode is very reliable with great edge detection and sharpness is always superb. Color accuracy can sometimes be sacrificed for overall pleasantness of the composition but that’s often better than a less interesting outcome. Apple is getting close but it’s just still not really close for still photography.**SPEAKERS & AUDIO**iPhone Xs|Speakers are clear but I have to point out that the downward firing speaker is easy to cover. Audio quality is clear but never distorted. One thing people don’t point out is that audio off of the dongle is way better on the iPhone than Pixel. Using respective dongles and Etymotic ER4XRs (one of the best neutral in-ear monitors), it’s noticable that iPhone has a fuller and more high definition experience without any EQ compensation. Pixel 3|Speakers are clear and capable of very loud volume. I don’t experience any of the rattling so many people have been discussing but when you actually hold the phone, the bass frequencies are really pronounced in the hand. If you leave the handset on a surface, you won’t notice it at all but as soon as you’re holding it in the hand, the pulsing of low bass frequencies is clearly present. Audio off of the dongle is not as 3D as on the iPhone - while it is clear and refined, there is a certain flatness to the audio without any EQ compensation. **CONCLUSION & TL:DR**iPhone Xs|The iPhone is a spectacular device. It’s been very clearly designed as a luxury item, which in my opinion deserves such a high price. The phone is slightly tiring to use one handed but the quality of build and display makes up for that inconvenience. iOS is very refined with almost no stuttering and the integration with other devices on the Apple ecosystem is a huge convenience. Photos are great but don’t reach the jaw-dropping sophistication of Google’s image processing just yet. Video/Audio recording is the best of any phone currently and if you do a lot of video, this is a no brainer. If you want the phone to work beautifully without much input, this is a great device worth the money.Pixel 3|What Google is doing with a third generation phone without the massive production operation that Apple has is remarkable. The phone delivers on so many points. Video doesn’t match the quality of still photography and the audio seems like it’s from a $400 phone instead of a $800 flagship. This phone is about minimalism and incredible photography. The bells & whistles are hit or miss (call screening doesn’t work unless you enable it, music detection is spotty, etc.) but the core features are at the flagship level. The phone has incredible potential and if you want to be at the front of the line for those innovations, this is the phone for you. However, being at the cutting edge comes with a price and that kind of experience at $800+ can either be a blessing or a curse for the user.**MY THINKING BEFORE DECIDING**It's tough to decide between the phones. At $800, the Pixel 3 gets most of the way of what iPhone has to offer. The photography is incredible but some of the flaws of the video/audio recording and speakers leave me on the fence. While I know iPhone is more conservative in its customizations, the iOS is rock solid and reliable with so many apps feeling more complete than on Android. However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","Iphone not smooth anymore ?.Hi all. Im new to apple ecosystem and currently using iphone xs. Loving it to the max. However, coming from pixel 2xl, im feeling that xs drops more frame while scrolling in 3rd party apps compared to pixel 2xl. It was clear when i scroll slowly in certain apps especially in app store itself. It was messy stutter ! But the quality of apps itself beat android counterpart. Would like to know is this a normal behaviour or does my device is a fault one ? I remember last time apple was really well known for their smoothness and consistency accross their platform. I have read that IOS 12 fixed this issue but drom my view, it does not really 100% solve this issue. Im on ios12.1"
"Positive","Long-term Android Fanboy thinking about switching..Hey everyone, I've been using Android since the Nexus 3 (Galaxy Nexus) and now I have the Note 4. I love my Android dearly, it does everything I want with the perfect amount of logic. I don't have to guess where a setting or whatever is because I've used it for long enough to know where things should and shouldn't be. Now, I'm considering switching to the iPhone 7 when it releases later this year. I know iOS 10 and the iPhone 7 might resolve some of my woes but I had some concerns that I'm hoping some of you guys can help me resolve. First and foremost, I'm worried about the screen. I love my pixels and the fact that the iPhone 6s/s Plus has a 720p and a 1080p screen respectfully kind of scares me. Now, I've used the iPhone 6 in particular, my Dad, Mom and sister all have the 6 and 6s, and I know the screen looks good, but that fact that the phone costs nearly $1,000 with a lower resolution screen in 2016 really makes me question how Apple can justify charging so much. My second concern is the camera. I have a 16MP camera on my Note 4 and it's amazing, I love it. Optical Image Stabilization is a God send especially in our colder Canadian weathers. I know the 6S Plus has OIS and I'm glad that it does, but I'm more worried about the quality. iPhones from what I've seen never really produced the best pictures when compared to their Android counterparts. Even my current Note is the preferred camera when we go out, over my Sister's 6s. I'm just wondering if it's just my eyes, or maybe the quality of the screen protector that's causing images to appear not so amazing. My last concern is with iCloud. As I'm typing this I'm trying to get my iPad on my iCloud account and somehow my sister's phone got affected and my Mom's iCloud lost her notes. I'm not sure because I signed her out of the iPad or what but iCloud has been the worst part of Apple's ecosystem for me and I'm really hoping a revamp is in order this year. Maybe to the settings or the ease of use, I'm not sure. It's just one of my concerns. The reason I want to switch is because I'm already in the Apple ecosystem in a way. I have an iPad, Macbook Pro, iMac and I also love the build of the iPhone. Every Android phone I've had had some sort of screen issue and *that might have been just me being unlucky* but so far, 100% of my phones had issues. "
"Positive","4 months with my iPhone 15 Pro ( A review from a lifelong android user ).I got my iPhone 15 Pro Black Titanium 256GB (brand new) for $850 around 4 months ago. And I'm not gonna lie, I love it. I didn’t get the iPhone 16 Pro because I just didn’t find the camera button very appealing. It was very less of an upgrade. Previously I was using a budget android. From that to this flagship was a huge upgrade indeed. Though there are many things that I like and dislike about this phone.I already had a MacBook M3 Pro when I bought this phone. I also bought AirPods Pro 2 with it. I can tell the ecosystem of Apple devices is really seamless. The photo and video quality on this phone is really great, just like almost every other flagship of course. But one thing I really like is its RAW formats. The ProRAW photos and ProRes Apple Log are just insanely good. I don't think any other smartphone in the market can produce raw videos like ProRes Apple Log of an iPhone. Just love it. Another thing I love about iPhone is the apps. For some reason, apps on iPhone are just more polished and smooth compared to Android. I don't know if it's just me or if it's really the case. And many more devs and companies are prioritizing Apple devices over Android, which is why many great apps are only available on iPhones. Regardless, I really love some of its apps.One thing I really dislike about this phone is its battery life. Battery life is really bad compared to Androids of this budget range. I get max 5-6hr screen-on time as I am a heavy user. Sometimes I get only 4 hours. I am needing to use a power bank if I plan on staying out the whole dat. And there are some more things that are missing on iPhone like clipboard and universal back gesture. iPhones sometimes feel like they prioritize form over function. And as much as I love the smooth animations, sometimes it's just irritating. Some animations are just too slow, e.g., the locking animation. It takes like half a second to lock the screen. And I wish the camera had Pro Mode.Anyways. It’s a great phone regardless."

However, iPhone's solid but not spectacular still camera prevents me from crossing back to the other side of the technology canyon.I'm happy to answer any questions you may have! I'll update this post in a week or so when I make up my mind."
"Positive","Google Ecosystem on iPhone - Switch from Pixel?.**I am thinking of moving from Pixel 3 to iPhone 12 for my personal phone.

"Positive","AirPods vs Pixel Buds.Before I get started I want to say that all this is my thoughts on the products in terms of design and uniqueness, this doesn't mean to say that one is better than the other and I am fully aware I am writing this in an iPhone subreddit, I just thought I would share my opinions. Also I know that Pixel Buds aren't released yet but from what we have seen to date.I was watching and after looking at the two different types of Bluetooth headphones that are in direct competition with one another.Firstly, AirPods:The AirPods have been out a while and there was a lot of contrasting opinions on the design that Apple went with during the keynote last year. Also the price took people back, how they could charge $159 for something like that. But since then I think the people that own the AirPods would say that they are worth the money, especially if you are in the Apple Ecosystem, with how they are remembered with your iCloud account and link to all your Apple devices.Moving onto the Pixel Buds, when I saw them revealed I saw something that didn't look very innovative at all (to my eye), there are many different bluetooth earbuds that share similar designs to that of the Pixel Buds and for me the quality of the materials doesn't look as high end as a pair of AirPods.The matte plastic that the physical earbud is constructed from makes it look like a car dashboard and not something that would fit nicely for a prolonged amount of time. Also the earbud looks like they've just taken the design of the AirPods and Bose SoundSport earphones, and is there really any need for that wire/rope/cable?Also what happens if you want to use the Pixel Buds with just one bud in at a time, does the other one just bounce around while walking about?I will highly commend the addition of real-time translation, thats something that in certain situations could be really useful, and I look forward to seeing how that works.Overall, I feel as if the Pixel Buds have been made so that they can have headphones for a device that now has no headphone jack and they put it together in a rush and it looks like a bit of an after thought, where as when the AirPods where revealed Apple had put the effort in to create something that we hadn't seen before and built for all types of uses.

"Positive","After 12 years with android its time to give Apple another go (2 weeks later).Pic of [setup](https://imgur.com/a/8Vs0U2q)Hello, some of you may have seen my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/115py24/after_12_years_with_android_its_time_to_give/) where i showed my switch to iphone and talked a bit about why i decided to give IOS a go. It has now been 2 weeks so i wanted to share my experience with switching to a new ecosystem as a long time android user. *Warning its a long post***Airpods pro (Good things)**- Legit the best earbuds i have tried so far, ive used earbuds from samsung, sennheiser, jabra and sony and overall i think apple makes the best. Sennheiser is a good second.- Comfort is top notch and i can wear them for hours without problems and they sit pretty sturdy even with a fast bike ride.- Noice canceling is next level, everytime i wear them i feel like im wearing a helmet where all noise are mostly gone with only my music left.  - Switching between my watch, ipad and iphone is seamless and super easy.**(bad things about the airpods)**- THEY ARE SLIPPERY AS HELL. Legit never dropped earbuds as many times as i have with this single product. - They have a weird glitch sometimes where one earbud will suddenly just be a little more louder than the other. They ususally go back to normal on their own but still annoying.- This is a nitpick. I hate the color, i wish they were black since the white gets scratched easily and they are super visible. **Apple watch (Good things)**- The design of the watch is perfect. I think apple made the right choice sticking with this design and just improving it each year. Its light, looks great and the watch faces makes it seem like a natural watch. - Battery has been great! I checked apples website and they promise 18 hours of use so i was prepared to charge everyday around 22 but i was generally surprised to see i could get almost 2 days of use out of them before they needed to be charged and that is with sleep tracking. - Fitness features are more refined than on android. On my galaxy watch 4 after a 15 minutes run on treadmill on 15 km/hr it would rate my heartrate at 199 which is maximum which would put me at a horrible shape. The apple watch rated my heartrate at a more believable 169. Overall its also much easier to use and more fun as navigation is fluid and workouts are motivated with rings and medals. **(bad things about apple watch)**- Sleep tracking should have more information and also give me some kind of rating whether im sleeping right or not. **Iphone (good things)**- Love the design, the boxy flat screen is just great and feels so good to hold (insert joke). - Apps are much better optimized on apple and even the gym app i use is a WHOLE DIFFERENT app on iphone compared to android which is kind of annoying but at least i can use the better version now. - I play a lot of games on phone (dont judge me) and for some reason i want to play even more on my iphone. Maybe its for nostalgic reasons cuz i used to have an ipod touch where i spend all day playing on it. - The processor is fast and more importantly ITS COOL on a few androids i have had i always experience a lot of heat from the back of the device when used intensely, on iphone i only experience this when im charging.- Switching over my whatsapp and messages/contacts was much easier than it used to be (for context i switched from an s21 ultra) all my stuff was there and ready to be used. The backup and restore feature on iphone is also much better. I had to return the first iphone i bought cuz it had a dead pixel i noticed a little late so i was given a new one, when i came home and set it up using the backup from the first iphone it had all my stuff ready with widgets and appdata (like i never left) and only needed a password or 2 for my mails. - Face ID is such a nice feature to have in the cold since i dont need to remove my gloves to get into my device. I just need to hold it up to my face. - Delightful haptics**(bad things about Iphone)**- Battery life has been decent but its not great for heavy use. I can kill it using it from 7 in the morning to 21 in the evening which is decent but doesn´t beat my s21 ultra which usually had 30% left after the same day so could still go out (but makes sense with the bigger body).- Charging is slow, it takes about 2 hours from 15 to 100 where i was so used to charging my devices full in 58 minutes. - The size of the phone is a bit too small for my liking, i find myself not enjoying scrolling webpages or watching something as much as i used to. I did try the iphone 14 pro max but that device IS WAY TOO BIG and apple does not use that space more efficient. Everything on the pro max just looks like an iphone 14 pro zoomed in instead of giving me more icons on my homescreen or having the option to do splitscreen. For some reason i think my s21 ultra is easy to hold and use while the pro max is heavy and hard to hold. I think its because apple focused on making the pro max wider and heavier while samsung focused on taller and slimmer. I think samsungs approach is the right one.- Transfering data is a pain. I really do not like itunes, since it only regonized very few file types and im forced to use third party apps to transfer alot of movies and some important documents i keep on me. Androids drag and drop is just so much simplier.- File types on Iphone are a mess, as a student i usually have to open a lot of different file types i get send or the instructor put out for us. Iphone seems to have issues regonizing some filetypes and i even had to google how to open a PDF on iphone. Turns out i could either pay a monthly fee for an app or insert the pdf into the books app where i then can open to view content. Which is pretty annoying overall as there are many times where on android i can pretty much read and save anything i want from the web. - Iphone can be boring at times, i do miss being able to customize my device by redoing my whole homescreen or changing launcher or fiddling with widgets i can make myself. On iphone you get what you have, and it becomes a bit boring looking at the same homescreen after a while (though this is more of a personal note since most dont really care).- Lack of emulators is also a factor why iphone can be boring, there are so many interesting apps you can get on android that just does not exist on iphone. As i mentioned before i play a lot of games on my phone where emulators is a big part of that. I used to play PS1, N64 and snes all on the go on my samsung where i just dont have the same options on iphone unless i do some weird workaround that only works for 7 days. - Siri is useless, enough said. - Reminders isnt really helpful, as on android i can go ""hey google, remind me to pick up my tickets on tuesday at 13"" and then at tuesday 12 i would get a notification reminding me of that where iphone dont remind me with notification it just shows a plus one on my reminders app. - Apple lightning port is super annoying (nitpick) since with ipad it uses USB C and everything else i own uses USB C. I normally only have 1 USB C cable near my desk to charge everything but due to iphone i now need to have 2 even when i leave for UNI or work. - Notifications are a mess, sometimes i get notified other times i dont and it only groups notifications after when i recieved them. So i usually miss a few things since they get buried under the other new notifications i get where on android i can see them all at once. Phew, that was a long post but i wanted to be thorough with my points.So the big question after all of this is ""will i keep moving forward with apple?"" And the answer is....... prob not.There are too much i miss from android where i feel like apple is a fresh new place i explored vs coming home to android where i feel at ease. As exciting as it has been using apple the back of my head have that feeling of ""when am i going back home (android)"" which is a shame cuz i did enjoy using em.I will keep using my airpods pro and ipad (cuz android tablets are shit) but in a month or two im gonna sell my iphone for 90% of the cost and get me a s23 plus. The apple watch will be a gift for someone.  If you have any questions feel free to ask."
"Positive","iOS vs Android - An Unbiased Comparison - In no particular order....##App Store- The apps on the iPhone seem to have a little more polish - Whatsapp and Instagram seem like 2nd class citizens on Android. - The curation of the Apple store is far superior to Google's- There are certainly more 'open' apps on Android (emulators, customisation apps), but there are big name early releases on iOS, and some very solid exclusive apps (Bear, Things 3, Narwhal, Apollo, Forecast Bar etc)- I did like that I could install apps in bulk on Android (saving time with a clean install)- I could install from my broweser with Andriod (great when I didn't have my phone with me)- Side note: my favourite weather app on Android - Timeline Weather - was pulled by the dev as it was not profitable. Side loading copied apps are not helping Android's ecosystem.##Bluetooth- Things just connect happily on iOS - I've not had to go to the settings even once to reconnect headphones (or the car radio), even after they have connected with other devices. My Android device was a little hit and miss (but it did always work eventually - so it wasn't a big issue).##Notifications- iOS12's 'bundled' notifications are an improvment over the old 'notification flood' and 3D touch for quick, rich-data notifications and responses is very nice.- Android notifications are far superior - cleaner, easier to deal with, and always sitting there, waiting to be dealt with. I miss them.##Control Panel- Apple's control panel is very simple and sparse, but does most of what I would need a control panel to do (and 3D touch improves things further).- I did like Android's way of long-pressing a control panel widget to jump straight to its settings - and being able to customise it in an order I liked.##Nova vs 3D Touch- This isn't really fair, as there is no equivalent on iOS, but Nova *made* Android for me - the slick cutomisation of layout and gestures on folders and screen where amazing. I have a huge screen on my phone now, but I have to suffer these little boxes, all lined up, and ugly folders. I freaking LOVE Nova.- 3D Touch gives me a lot of what Nova did (quickly get to Bluetooth with a hard press on the settings; jump to recent contacts in Messages etc). - Pop-n-Peek within apps is nice too - but I don't really know why you can't just do a long press for the same results.##Siri Shortcuts- Most Android users who want to customise automation will use Tasker (personally I love 'MacDroid'). However Siri Shortcuts really gives some power to automate the phone, and mixing them into an app such as Launch Centre Pro (or even just using the default widgets) is really useful.- Only 2 weeks of using shortcuts  and r/shortcuts is already doing some wild coding.##Widgets- Being able to place widgets anywhere on Android was lovely (calendars, to-do lists, weather etc) and it's definately better than iOS's 'swipe left for a stack of widget stuff'. Some of the iOS widgets are pretty good though, especially being able to see battery power of connected Bluetooth devices (great for headphones).##SettingsBoth OS's have so many options now, it's a nightmare to find anything. However, the search works equally well on both. Apple's layout is a little easier to delve into - but there are fewer options as Android lets you delve into the more geeky parts of the OS.##Fingerprint vs Face- The new FaceID is pretty much instant - pull the phone out, flick up and your done.- There have a been a couple of times when the phone has been on a table, and I would have liked to have just used my finger, but the split second it take to move my head into the range of FaceID is not going to kill me.- One adventage to FaceID is with notifications. If they pop up on the phone, they will just tell you the app-type and say 'notification' - but as soon as you look at the phone, the noficiation displays its information. This is great for 2-step verification texts, as they don't suddenly pop-up on your phone without the owner looking at it. - Face ID with a password app is amazing - just go to a website, click password and look at the phone! ##Messaging- Personally, I'd have everyone on WhatsApp, for universal messaging, but iMessage is incredibly good. iPhone-to-iPhone gives a wealth of option and fun features (although the amusment of Animoji's wear's thin very fast). Being able to share a Spotify track, map location or even the weather for where you are is fantastic.- However, Pulse on Android had a 'delay send', which I really loved, and it worked perfectly in a browser on a computer (Textra was also great).##Gestures- iOS does this really well - screen space isn't taken up with psudo buttons, and the gestures are fluid and easy - they've actually been fun to use.- I thought I'd miss the 'back-button' but every app I use seems to have adopted the 'swipe right to go back' option, and after a couple of days my thumb stopped travelling to the bottom of the phone to search for a button that wasn't there.- I do miss being able to program buttons to do what I want, but with Gestures becoming the new norm, this feature won't be around for too much longer.- I have found that using the accessibility section on the iPhone, there are some extra shortcuts I can throw into the mix (quickly getting to Notifications, Control Centre, Screenshots or Mute). Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch##Siri vs Google Assistant- Google Assistant wins. Hands down. But thankfully she exists as a widget on iOS, so she is only a swipe away (I LOVE Google Assistant). - Having both on the phone is actually pretty great - I use them for totally different things with Siri-Shortcuts now though.##Updates- My 2 year old Android just got the Nougat update, just as Pie was coming out.- iOS12... installed within minutes of being released.##Battery-My 2 year old Android's battery decided it was time to swell to twice its normal size.##Odds and Sods - My fave things- Best Twitter app: Tweetbot (iOS) / Talon (Android)- Best Reddit app: Apollo (or Narwal) (iOS) / Sync (Android)- Best Email: Gmail (iOS / Android)- Best Reminder App: Due (iOS) - I've yet to find any app that nags you as well as this one- Having 2 Apple Stores near me, and buying Apple Care means that I can get any problem fixed pretty much on the spot. My Android required being sent away and having a crappy loaner phone for the interim."
"Positive","Switching from Android (7 years) to iOS and iPhone X. Oreo is phenomenal. These iOS 11 posts have me worried..Hi all. I currently run the OG Pixel, and have stuck with Google devices for as long as I can remember. Started with Galaxy Nexus, 5, 6, 6P, Pixel. Throw a Samsung device or 2 in there as well. I love phones, and I've always loved Android. I am heavily involved in Google's ecosystem.  However, I was also working Apple retail when the OG iPhone launched. Those times were magical. Everything about the phone was magical. Every detail Apple created was flawless. And on top of that, the early days of jailbreaking were sort of heart stopping, wondering if you'd brick your device to get Labyrinth on your phone.  I am disappointed by all of the posts I see here and on /r/ios. I have Oreo on my OG Pixel now and truthfully, it's flawless. No bugs, great UI, great UX, and Google Assistant is better than ever. So, why switch? The Pixel 2 from a design standpoint isn't inspiring to me. I don't want the XL, and the standard size is underwhelming with it's design. Couple that with the edge to edge display of the iPhone X...it's beautiful. I haven't felt that beauty draw towards the iPhone since the first. It's always been about the fact that Android just ""gets"" me, because I'm in the system. And I've always gave the design of Android devices a pass.I suppose I'm just looking for reassurance, if there is any. The iPhone X is gorgeous. And while I am fully aware of some things I will most likely despise on iOS (notifications, oh no) it's OK to me, because I am willing to relearn and reshape habits. But, I was also looking forward to a fast, fluid, bug free experience. It's always been a common point when discussing iOS vs Android. But now, with these posts, I'm worried this is absolutely the worst time to switch.  **Edit** Thanks for all the comments so far everyone. I definitely feel a bit better."
"Positive","As someone currently on the other side of the fence just to try things out, I really miss having an iPhone and I finally realized exactly why..I had been a long time iPhone user, since I was about 14 or 15 up until this past April when I switched over to try the S9, so about 8 years. I had had a bad string of luck with my iPhones for the past 3 years, using the 6 for over over 2 years and then going down to an SE because I loved the size while still retaining the 6 specs (for the most part). I grew increasingly frustrated with poor battery life and speed issues among other things and when TMobile came out with their sweet military plan with a great sale on galaxies, I decided to make the switch, figuring i just needed to shake things up a bit and finally be able to have a valid opinion about both sides of the argument. Now, I do like my S9. It's sleek, fast and does have a few features that I like, notably the Dolby ATMOS speakers, variable screen resolution and how easy it is to put files on the device. But I can't help but feel like the phone is disorganised, with it's menus and settings and huge amount of variables that it took to change the phone to make it feel the way I wanted it to. And that is where I realized the fundamental difference between iPhone and Android: the pick-it-up-and-usability of an iPhone vs the amount of tinkering you can do with an Android. And I know that this is a well known idea, considering the open source nature of Android, but it really took me using one to really appreciate the difference. I miss the easy ecosystem that iOS harbors. I miss how crisp everything felt on iPhone whereas on Android I have 3-4 different software developers constantly competing for prevalence in my UI. I miss Carplay in particular; as an Apple Music user still using the service on Android the app feels super half baked and isn't even compatible with Android Auto. I just really do miss my iPhone, and going forward I'm going to stop getting phones a generation or 1.5 gens behind like I had been with my previous phones, as I'm sure that contributed to my issues. I'm going to be switching back at my next opportunity and I can't wait. "
"Positive","Is Anyone else Feeling Bored of IPhone but Stuck in the Apple Ecosystem?.Is it just me, or are iPhones getting kind of… boring? I’ve been an iPhone user for years, and while I’ve dipped my toes into the Android world with Samsung and Google Pixel from time to time, I always end up back with Apple. It’s not that I don’t want to switch—I’m just deeply stuck in the Apple ecosystem. I’ve got the MacBook, iPads, Apple TV, Apple Card, and the whole nine yards. Plus, my family is all about Apple too, so it’s tough to deal with the whole “blue bubble” iMessage situation.I’m curious: is anyone else feeling the itch to switch but finds it hard to break free? What’s holding you back—ecosystem, family, features? Or, on the flip side, is anyone thinking about switching *to* an iPhone? I’d love to hear your thoughts!"

Iphone seems to have issues regonizing some filetypes and i even had to google how to open a PDF on iphone. Turns out i could either pay a monthly fee for an app or insert the pdf into the books app where i then can open to view content. Which is pretty annoying overall as there are many times where on android i can pretty much read and save anything i want from the web. - Iphone can be boring at times, i do miss being able to customize my device by redoing my whole homescreen or changing launcher or fiddling with widgets i can make myself. On iphone you get what you have, and it becomes a bit boring looking at the same homescreen after a while (though this is more of a personal note since most dont really care).- Lack of emulators is also a factor why iphone can be boring, there are so many interesting apps you can get on android that just does not exist on iphone. As i mentioned before i play a lot of games on my phone where emulators is a big part of that. I used to play PS1, N64 and snes all on the go on my samsung where i just dont have the same options on iphone unless i do some weird workaround that only works for 7 days. - Siri is useless, enough said. - Reminders isnt really helpful, as on android i can go ""hey google, remind me to pick up my tickets on tuesday at 13"" and then at tuesday 12 i would get a notification reminding me of that where iphone dont remind me with notification it just shows a plus one on my reminders app. - Apple lightning port is super annoying (nitpick) since with ipad it uses USB C and everything else i own uses USB C. I normally only have 1 USB C cable near my desk to charge everything but due to iphone i now need to have 2 even when i leave for UNI or work. - Notifications are a mess, sometimes i get notified other times i dont and it only groups notifications after when i recieved them. So i usually miss a few things since they get buried under the other new notifications i get where on android i can see them all at once. Phew, that was a long post but i wanted to be thorough with my points.So the big question after all of this is ""will i keep moving forward with apple?"" And the answer is....... prob not.There are too much i miss from android where i feel like apple is a fresh new place i explored vs coming home to android where i feel at ease. As exciting as it has been using apple the back of my head have that feeling of ""when am i going back home (android)"" which is a shame cuz i did enjoy using em.I will keep using my airpods pro and ipad (cuz android tablets are shit) but in a month or two im gonna sell my iphone for 90% of the cost and get me a s23 plus. The apple watch will be a gift for someone.  If you have any questions feel free to ask."
"Positive","Switching from Android (7 years) to iOS and iPhone X. Oreo is phenomenal. These iOS 11 posts have me worried..Hi all. I currently run the OG Pixel, and have stuck with Google devices for as long as I can remember. Started with Galaxy Nexus, 5, 6, 6P, Pixel. Throw a Samsung device or 2 in there as well. I love phones, and I've always loved Android. I am heavily involved in Google's ecosystem.  However, I was also working Apple retail when the OG iPhone launched. Those times were magical. Everything about the phone was magical. Every detail Apple created was flawless. And on top of that, the early days of jailbreaking were sort of heart stopping, wondering if you'd brick your device to get Labyrinth on your phone.  I am disappointed by all of the posts I see here and on /r/ios. I have Oreo on my OG Pixel now and truthfully, it's flawless. No bugs, great UI, great UX, and Google Assistant is better than ever. So, why switch? The Pixel 2 from a design standpoint isn't inspiring to me. I don't want the XL, and the standard size is underwhelming with it's design. Couple that with the edge to edge display of the iPhone X...it's beautiful. I haven't felt that beauty draw towards the iPhone since the first. It's always been about the fact that Android just ""gets"" me, because I'm in the system. And I've always gave the design of Android devices a pass.I suppose I'm just looking for reassurance, if there is any. The iPhone X is gorgeous. And while I am fully aware of some things I will most likely despise on iOS (notifications, oh no) it's OK to me, because I am willing to relearn and reshape habits. But, I was also looking forward to a fast, fluid, bug free experience. It's always been a common point when discussing iOS vs Android. But now, with these posts, I'm worried this is absolutely the worst time to switch.  **Edit** Thanks for all the comments so far everyone. I definitely feel a bit better."
"Positive","As someone currently on the other side of the fence just to try things out, I really miss having an iPhone and I finally realized exactly why..I had been a long time iPhone user, since I was about 14 or 15 up until this past April when I switched over to try the S9, so about 8 years. I had had a bad string of luck with my iPhones for the past 3 years, using the 6 for over over 2 years and then going down to an SE because I loved the size while still retaining the 6 specs (for the most part). I grew increasingly frustrated with poor battery life and speed issues among other things and when TMobile came out with their sweet military plan with a great sale on galaxies, I decided to make the switch, figuring i just needed to shake things up a bit and finally be able to have a valid opinion about both sides of the argument. Now, I do like my S9. It's sleek, fast and does have a few features that I like, notably the Dolby ATMOS speakers, variable screen resolution and how easy it is to put files on the device. But I can't help but feel like the phone is disorganised, with it's menus and settings and huge amount of variables that it took to change the phone to make it feel the way I wanted it to. And that is where I realized the fundamental difference between iPhone and Android: the pick-it-up-and-usability of an iPhone vs the amount of tinkering you can do with an Android. And I know that this is a well known idea, considering the open source nature of Android, but it really took me using one to really appreciate the difference. I miss the easy ecosystem that iOS harbors. I miss how crisp everything felt on iPhone whereas on Android I have 3-4 different software developers constantly competing for prevalence in my UI. I miss Carplay in particular; as an Apple Music user still using the service on Android the app feels super half baked and isn't even compatible with Android Auto. I just really do miss my iPhone, and going forward I'm going to stop getting phones a generation or 1.5 gens behind like I had been with my previous phones, as I'm sure that contributed to my issues. I'm going to be switching back at my next opportunity and I can't wait. "
"Positive","Is Anyone else Feeling Bored of IPhone but Stuck in the Apple Ecosystem?.Is it just me, or are iPhones getting kind of… boring? I’ve been an iPhone user for years, and while I’ve dipped my toes into the Android world with Samsung and Google Pixel from time to time, I always end up back with Apple. It’s not that I don’t want to switch—I’m just deeply stuck in the Apple ecosystem. I’ve got the MacBook, iPads, Apple TV, Apple Card, and the whole nine yards. Plus, my family is all about Apple too, so it’s tough to deal with the whole “blue bubble” iMessage situation.I’m curious: is anyone else feeling the itch to switch but finds it hard to break free? What’s holding you back—ecosystem, family, features? Or, on the flip side, is anyone thinking about switching *to* an iPhone? I’d love to hear your thoughts!"
"Positive","One Month with iPhone 16 Pro as a New Apple User – My Honest Review.So, here's my experience after one month of using the iPhone 16 Pro as a new Apple user.I've been an Android guy my whole life (previously used a Pixel 7), and the first thing I noticed with iOS is that *everything just works*. On Android, there were times I had to practically fight with an app to get it to work properly. So far, on iOS, I haven’t faced any major issues with apps. What really amazed me is the notifications—I’m receiving *all* of them! On Android, especially with Gmail, I used to miss notifications from time to time.Now, onto the iPhone itself: I absolutely love it. It's pricey, but I think it's worth it for the build quality and performance. One small gripe I have is that some social media apps don’t run at 120Hz (looking at you, Reddit), which is disappointing given the power this phone has. However, browsing websites has been smooth with no issues at all.**Camera:** The camera is everything I was looking for in my upgrade. My favorite feature is the photographic styles—being able to edit photos exactly how I want without losing quality is a game changer. Uploading photos to Instagram has also been a blissful experience since I made the switch. Video quality is great too, except for a few instances. For example, when I recorded footage while playing soccer in a stadium, I got a lot of lens flare from the stadium lights, which was annoying. But aside from that, it’s been excellent.Overall, I’m super happy with the purchase. The iPhone feels *refined*, whereas on Android, I sometimes felt like I was using a half-baked product. I do understand that it’s tough for developers to optimize for so many different Android devices, though.**Quick Review on AirPods Max:**  Don’t get me wrong, these are my first over-ear wireless headphones, and I *love* the ANC. I tried them on a train and even while vacuuming, and they blocked out everything. The ANC is so natural that I almost questioned if it was even on! Definitely the best I’ve experienced. But, when it comes to sound quality, I was disappointed. Honestly, they sound like garbage compared to my Sennheiser HD6XX. I know it’s unfair to compare wired, open-back headphones with wireless ones, but at $200, the HD6XX feels like a steal compared to the Max. Heck, even my cheap Anker Liberty 4s sound better than the AirPods Max. That said, the build quality, fit, transparency mode, and ANC are fantastic. If you don’t switch between headphones often, you’ll probably love these.**Apple Watch Experience:**  I don’t really know what Apple wants me to do with the activity rings—they’re everywhere, but the things I care about most (like sleep tracking and step count) seem hidden away for some reason. Also, for some odd reason, the watch tracks my sleep even when I’m not wearing it.**Conclusion:**  In short, I’m loving the switch to Apple and I’m already working on convincing my friends and family to switch too!https://preview.redd.it/apj05jgdtpud1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15d66eaef272e99d8df9cf8216236518ae028c27https://preview.redd.it/qunpxh3etpud1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5e66cd313b3c0dd17306505bb1edf6a5eae61e0https://preview.redd.it/p203ic3gtpud1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a2fd4db8ce78ce468f67d66f42d2c3465d100e1"
