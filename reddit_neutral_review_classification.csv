Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. "

JAN UPDATE RELEASED!I now have the January update installed and hesitantly tried to connect to my car. And.... it connected. It connected via phone first and not music media. Then I toggled the phone calls and the music audio on/off and it connected and worked. So when I now start my car all I have to do is now toggle on/off the audio music switch in the BT settings. A bit annoying but it works.  I will see how it holds up over the next few weeks. I also managed to get my wifes mazda working too. So theres definitely something with the new android jan update that has worked for me. I have also noticed that the BT connection is solid with out any skips or jitters.Give it a go.

I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn't seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that's weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it's the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that's why, then he asks if it's ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him ""absolutely not"" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, ""do you have access to your pixel 4a?"" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there's a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate.

Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. "

This time, they mentioned it might be an issue with my payment method, although I regularly use the same card for purchases. I tried again with a different card and made some changes to the order details, but the order was canceled once more. Eventually, I reached someone who went through the payment method with me step by step.

I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn't have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I'm still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all's interaction with this post.  I still can't recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I'd had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I'd strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8/28.  On 8/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren't sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should've contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it's tracking again.  On 9/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9/16 I received the following response:""After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn't process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.""Since that time I've attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a ""product specialist"".  The ""product specialist' is the person who actually has the power and I've yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I've even had the Missouri Attorney Generals' office reach out on my behalf and they've been provided the same canned response.I've repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I've done or should've done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google’s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google’s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don't even know what they think I've done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can't file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn't been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I've paid, but from everything I've read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn't acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I'm sure Google is counting on.  At this point I'm posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven't thought of or tried to this point."

The name is a misspelling of my own.I've chased up with DPD who said they will investigate the driver but can't help with the parcel.

However, both my IMEIs were still visible. I dropped it off at UBreakIFix and they confirmed that it was an issue with the board/modem. They let me have it while the board comes in, and now both IMEIs have also disappeared. Has anyone else had this issue?"

Granted it charges at about 50% speed, but it charges and the photo frame works.    It does have orange blinking light for a few seconds, but then charges and kicks off the photo frame.   Main reason I bought it is to have the photo frame at work, so my purpose may not be same as everyone else.  Could be the loop version without the centering magnet that allows this to work vs regular case."

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me / Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?"

This is a list of features I could think of that are on one platform, but not the other. Samsung Exclusives:* **Dex** Desktop Android - ~~Going away in OneUI 7~~ The desktop app is going away, Dex is staying.* ~~**SD Cards**~~ - None of their new phones, after the S20, have SD card slots* **Split audio** - You can pipe one app through one output and another app through another output (e.g. Chrome goes through the phone's speakers and YouTube goes through Bluetooth) * **Game mode** - Little features that make gaming easier, like locking the screen from touches, performance mode, hiding notifications, etc... * **Being able to map double clicking the power button to the flashlight instead of the camera** - This one ANNOYS THE SHIT OUT OF ME on Pixel. Moto let's you karate chop, Samsung let's you remap the power button, Pixel tells you to go fuck yourself even though there are literally hundreds and hundreds of complaints about this on their support forums and reddit. * **All of the Samsung ecosystem** - Bixby, Samsung Wallet, Samsung Find My Device, Galaxy App Store, etc... Not that anyone actually uses any of this. * **Miracast** - You can mirror your screen wirelessly to Roku sticks or any TV (most TVs) that support Miracast.* **Reset phone after 15 unlock attempts** - For some reason even though Apple and Samsung offer this feature, Pixel doesn't. * **Repeat notifications** - If you get a text or something you can make the phone ding multiple times instead of once (this is possible on Pixel with the Buzzkill app) Google Exclusives: ~~* **Call screening** - Unknown callers or people you don't want to talk to talk to Google and you see a text transcription on your phone~~ Bixby Text Call does this  * **Text transcriptions of voicemails** - Visual Voicemail without have to pay for it from the carrier (or use Google Voice)* **Wait on hold for me / Text navigation of IVRs** - Google goes through IVRs and alerts you when a human comes on the line* **Call summaries** - After years of actively blocking call recording (at least in the US) they now let Gemini Nano listen to your calls and make a call summary afterwards (at least on Pixel 9 and above - not on 8a) * **Seamless updates** - Updates install in the background, you reboot your phone, it's installed. Doesn't take 10+ minutes of installing They both have a bunch of AI camera stuff. Mainly the same functionality. It really seems like the unique features are the least unique they've ever been. Things like one hand mode, lock down, work profile, etc... that used to be OneUI exclusives were just absorbed by AOSP/Pixel. I'm sure I'm missing many things - Can you help me fill out the list?"

If detected, your phone will automatically lock, blocking unwanted access to your apps and data.  * **Offline Device Lock** automatically locks your screen if a thief tries to keep your phone disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time.  * **Remote Lock** lets you remotely lock your phone using just your phone number in case you can't sign into Find My Device using your Google account password.All three features entered beta in August, starting in Brazil. Google told me the final versions of these features would more widely roll out this year, and it seems the features have begun expanding.LMK which (if any) of these 3 new features you have!"
