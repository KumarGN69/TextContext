Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ""}"

I get a callback almost immediately from a Google California number and after hearing me out (though it didn\'t seem like he was really listening), the rep who called put me on hold and then the call hung up abruptly. I thought that\'s weird but almost immediately I get a call back from a ~~Sri Lankan~~ Indian number and it\'s the same guy. I press him on why the call disconnected, he explains there was a network issue and that\'s why, then he asks if it\'s ok if he sends a verification prompt to confirm my email, I tell him ""absolutely not"" but he persists and insists that he just needs to verify my account, ""do you have access to your pixel 4a?"" and he listed off my alternate number which clarified what he was trying to do so I hung up.I think this is wild that an official google rep would try this, I imagine there\'s a few that have fallen for this which is very concerning. I put in a ticket but I wanted you all to know.Update: u/PixelCommunity had a look into this and confirmed as a few of you said that this was legitimate.

Am I an irresponsible phone owner or is this an issue with Google phones?+Sort of venting in this post, but also curious to see if I'm the problem, lol...I've had Google Pixel phones for probably the last 8 years or so, starting with I think the 3 or 4? Anyway, about a year ago I had my Google Pixel 5a completely just crap out for no reason. I think it was a well known issue, but I was in a foreign country and the phone completely died and was quite stressed out, thankfully I wasn't traveling alone.That's all well and good, when I got home Google sent me a brand new 5a... which also completely bricked in less than two months of receipt. Yikes. I was so pissed and was constantly up Google support's ass about it, especially since this happened RIGHT when I fully paid off the phone.Google was kind enough to send me a Google Pixel 7 Pro to replace this one! But guess what? IT JUST BRICKED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER. WHAT THE FUCK?! The screen started flickering and eventually just does not turn on. Does Google make vaporware phones?I was so excited to have a phone fully paid off and not have any more monthly payments, but now I'm at the point where I think I'll never buy a Pixel again.UPDATE: During troubleshooting with Google support, the screen randomly started working again (after an hour of repeated resets and other attempts), with nothing Google recommended working. When the screen popped back on, it was actually at the end of a system update. I've been having some green screen flickering issues occasionally but nothing that lasted more than a minute until this. I suspect it was just some issue with the flickering occurring during a system update that made it seem like it was beyond repair. That said, the green screen flicker is still there and unresolved, but at least not long lasting. I've removed the OtterBox since some people said that's known to cause overheating and flickering. If there are any recommendations for cases that can avoid this and still provide decent drop protection I'm all ears. ""}"

I ultimately still come out somewhat hosed as I bought a watch and earbuds with the store credit & bonus offer I received with the phone purchase which ultimately got deducted from my refund amount.  I wouldn\'t have moved forward with either of those purchases had the store credit not been there.  I\'m still way better off than I was previously though thanks to your all\'s interaction with this post.  I still can\'t recommend purchasing through the Google Store though.  I\'d had several positive experiences previously, but the headache of this purchase has made any future purchases not worth the risk to me and I\'d strongly advise you to look for in store offers for yourselves.  **Original post** \\- I ordered a Pixel 9 Pro XL and case from the google store on 8/28.  On 8/30 I had a package delivered via FedEx, which I ultimately discovered only contained the case that I ordered.  I reached out to Google to confirm they weren\'t sending two separate packages and they confirmed that the package I received should\'ve contained the phone that I ordered as well.  They then sent out another phone via FedEx that day.  That phone made it to the FedEx distribution center near me and then never updated it\'s tracking again.  On 9/10, Google sent another phone via FedEx.  That package was delivered on 9/13 and once again I received an empty box.  I then sent Google videos of the delivery, the outside of the package and of me opening the package.  On 9/16 I received the following response:""After careful examination, the Product Specialist  has confirmed that due to circumstances surrounding your request and in adherence to Google Store Sales Terms & Return Policy we couldn\'t process refund or replacement for your replacement order and their decision is final.""Since that time I\'ve attempted on numerous occasions to try and speak with someone who could actually help me get a resolution to this matter.  Should you ever find yourself in a similar situation, what you will discover is that your only options to contact google are through a web chat or via phone where they call you.  In either circumstance you will be put in touch with someone in a call center who has zero power and will act as your intermediary between you and a ""product specialist"".  The ""product specialist\' is the person who actually has the power and I\'ve yet to find a way to directly interact with one.  Google has repeatedly given me the same response and just hides behind their terms and conditions.  I\'ve even had the Missouri Attorney Generals\' office reach out on my behalf and they\'ve been provided the same canned response.I\'ve repeatedly asked Google the following questions to which they refuse to respond.  1.  What it is that I\'ve done or should\'ve done that violated their terms and conditions?  2.  Specifically, which of Google’s terms and conditions have been violated?  3.  Which of Google’s terms and conditions support its decision to neither provide me with the device I ordered and paid for nor return my money?  At this point I still don\'t even know what they think I\'ve done wrong.FedEx clearly seems to be the party at fault in this ordeal, but I can\'t file a freight claim without a waiver from Google and Google hasn\'t been willing to provide me with one.  At this point my options seem rather limited.  I could file a back charge with my credit card and be made whole on the money that I\'ve paid, but from everything I\'ve read that would result in the nuking of my google account which isn\'t acceptable to me.  My only other option would be to hire an attorney and request arbitration, but that would be expensive, which is what I\'m sure Google is counting on.  At this point I\'m posting to warn others and also hoping someone may have another idea or avenue to contact Google that I haven\'t thought of or tried to this point.'}"

No help from Google!+I am posting here as a last resort as I have already tried to get support from Google through various channels - including their live chat, telephone support, Twitter support. They just reiterate the same copy-pasted responses without actually understanding the issue. I have also tried to DM PixelCommunity here on Reddit as well as opened a ticket on dmziggy's Reddit Request form and also DM'ed him directly, receiving no response from all of these channels.I have now turned to post here as I have seen others have had their issues resolved or rectified after posting here and following the subsequent exposure to their issues. Seems Google does not care unless there is an outcry.To summarise what happened, I ordered a the 9 Pro XL directly from Google Store with an estimated delivery date of 22nd August (I have ordered the 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, Buds, Tablet etc all before with no issues). When I received the delivery box it already had some damage to it. Therefore, I immediately took photos of the entire unboxing process and lo and behold, the phone was not in the actual phone box, and instead there had been additional tissue paper stuffed inside to fill the space.I immediately went to Google support and have been battling with them over 3 weeks with over 20 emails sent from my end with very little response from them. They are refusing to help and are basically claiming that DPD tracking shows the package is delivered which means the phone must be in there. When I contact DPD, they said their contract is with Google so any missing items I need to raise with Google and they'll have to rectify/correct.Google Store support both via email or telephone support is zero help and I am really feeling helpless now as its nearing 3 weeks and they've ignored my past 4 emails sent to them over the past week. Can somebody please assist or help what I should do from here as a UK customer? I do not want to do a chargeback as I have EVERYTHING on my Google account so do not want to risk losing it all.TLDR: Phone stolen/lost from inside delivery box (images taken and sent to Google). Zero assistance or support from Google store on all their support channels over the past 3 weeks. Need advice on what do as a UK customer, feeling extremely helpless.""}"

For the past few months, I've had no audio when connecting my phone to Android Auto and I'm completely out of ideas of what to try. I've tried it with multiple cars and the issues persists. Other phones don't have this issue in the same cars. I'm using it via a cable and not bluetooth (don't have access to a car which supports bluetooth AA so no way to test that).Tested multiple cables with no difference. Can get the actual AA screen to show up in the car with no problem, it's purely audio that does not work and it's starting to become a real headache. It seems to have happened around the time I updated to Android 15 so I figured I'd wait to see if any updates fix it, which it hasn't.""}"

When the beta first launched two weeks ago, [it was reported](https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-begins-cellular-starlink-beta-but-it-only-works-on-these-samsung) that only 5 Samsung models were supported (Z Flip 6, Z Fold 6, S24 series). My OnePlus 13 wasn't accepted into the beta, but hopefully that'll change soon.FWIW: Google has been testing Starlink support on the Pixel 9 for a few months now.""}"
