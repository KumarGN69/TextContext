My apologies—I wrongly blamed Google.Note: Anyone experiencing this issue must charge the battery to 100% and then make sure to continue charging until the shield icon appears on the battery icon and the ""Charging Complete"" message reappears at the bottom of the lock screen before unplugging the charger. The trickle charge after reaching 100% is crucial because it calibrates the battery—it’s not a mistake.","1. After the Pixel 8's March update, the ""80% Charging Limit"" feature no longer displays charging status on the lock screen from 80% to 100%.
2. However, this issue can be resolved by charging the phone to 100%, allowing it to trickle charge until the shield icon appears and then unplugging. This calibrates the battery, restoring the 80% charging limit functionality."," Title: Test User Journey for Pixel 8 March Update Charging Issue Investigation

Objective: To confirm if the ""80% Charging Limit"" feature malfunctions after the March 2025 feature update on the Pixel 8 and to identify potential calibration issues.

Test Preparation:
1. Obtain a Pixel 8 device updated to the March 2025 feature release.
2. Charge the device to 100% and let it trickle charge until the shield icon appears next to the battery icon, ensuring the ""Charging Complete"" message reappears at the bottom of the lock screen. This step ensures that the battery is properly calibrated before testing.

Test Procedure:
1. Verify that the device is locked and the charging status text is not displayed on the lock screen when the battery reaches 80%.
2. Observe the charging status as the battery level increases from 80% to 100%. Confirm that the charging status text remains hidden at all times.
3. Once the battery reaches 100%, unplug the charger and observe if the shield icon disappears next to the battery icon.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 three more times to ensure repeatability of results.

Test Validation:
1. If the charging status text is hidden when the battery reaches 80% and remains so until 100%, then the issue can be considered as replicated, indicating that the ""80% Charging Limit"" feature does not work correctly after the March 2025 update.
2. If, upon charging to 100%, the shield icon appears next to the battery icon and the ""Charging Complete"" message reappears at the bottom of the lock screen before unplugging the charger, then the issue is not replicated, suggesting that it may be a one-time calibration issue after the system update.

Notes:
- Any user experiencing this issue should charge their Pixel 8 to 100% and let it trickle charge until the shield icon appears on the battery icon before unplugging the charger. This step is crucial because it calibrates the battery, as discussed in the update section of the review.
- Ensure that Adaptive Charging is not enabled during testing to isolate the issue.
- Document all observations and any additional findings for further analysis."
