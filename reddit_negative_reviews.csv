"Negative","1 year with pixel 8.So I got my G Pixel 8 on December 2023 because a cousin recommended it for me (he got a great time with the Pixel 5) and after one year with it, I can say it was the worst phone I got... Let me explainThe pixel 8 is an amazing phone, exceptional camera, great UI, nice processor, nice battery, nice AI options. But sadly, after 5 months of using the phone, the screen started blinking. I didn't think much of it at the time, assuming it was just an update error. Then the months passed, and the blinking became more frequent until the screen turned green. It pissed the hell out of me because I had never dropped the phone. After that, I realized my mistake when I chose this phone.Also I got issues like ghost touches, overheating and after the green screen problem, time later a white line appeared on the damn screen, and more bad stuff.In Latam, specifically in Costa Rica, there isn't a Google store or anything like that, so I wasn't able to use the warranty. Of course is my fault for choosing a phone with no physical store in Costa Rica but definitely Google doesn't make good phones. (Or Im not lucky)If you from latam and you got the money and you want a nice phone, you must go for an iPhone, iPhones last for years, mi madre got a XR(2018) and it still working like the first day"
"Negative","2 phones 1 sim.Hi, just picked up a pixel 7 pro for a second phone.. I currently have pixel fold 9 pro... (Hence the 2nd phone.. terrified my screen is going to break) Can I use one sim card to just go from one phone to the other..? "
"Negative","I dropped my phone and my screen went black until I took it to a repair shop. During that time I realized I couldn't even use my Google account on other devices since Google was querying 2 step verification with my broken phone. What can I do to avoid this in the future?.Is there a backup plan where I can do security questions or put in my wife's email as a backup?"
"Negative","Pixel 8 Pro screen scratches after 2 days?! What rubbish is this?.Anyone had sudden smudges or scratches show up (even slight blemishes) on their GP8pro? I've read this was an issue with the older Pixels, but surely they're not using the same crappy screens on the 8pro or even the 9 I dare ask?Any tips on how to remove the blemishes with a soft buff or polish?"

"Negative","I've had a pixel 2, 4, 6 Pro, and now a 9. It's worse than the 6 Pro and the 4.Does anyone else feel the same way? it's over optimised and incrementally changed where it's worse than it used to be.The voice controls don't work as well. ""Send a message to joey on WhatsApp saying I'll be 5 minutes""""Is that Joe Smith, Joe Watkins, or Joey?"" Fucking hell. It never used to ask this.Then I'll try ""play DJ on Spotify""Nothing happens. The camera is worse than the 6 Pro I had. Google Maps is always messing about optimising the route or doing something that means I have to touch the phone when driving.Google Photos constantly tries to scam me into a monthly membership by making it difficult to search photos.There are privacy settings I'm prompted to set to do with ads where I'm not clear which option is sending less data to advertisers.Constant emails from Google.What is happening?! The pixel 4 was peak Google, it all worked nicely. The good thing with the pixel 9 is that it was easy to set up even with my old one having a broken screen with me not being able to unlock it. Maybe I don't notice the changes because I hate apps and use the phone for music, messaging, chess.com, Reddit, maps, hotspotting"

Checked and verified they were on, turned them off and on again to verify it didn't say they were a day plus away, and I didn't get a notification saying I missed the alarms. They just never went off. I don't recall ever having this issue with my Pixel 8 pro in the year and a half I've owned it.I'm lucky I only woke up a little late."

"Negative","No matter what I do, my fingerprint set up keeps failing halfway - 3/4 of the way through.I am trying to set up my fingerprint to unlock my Google pixel 6a because it has stopped recognizing my finger recently for some reason. But whenever I start setting it up, I get to the ""press the tip of your finger"" or ""press the right side of your finger"" part and it suddenly stops and says ""Can't complete finger setup. You can try again now or set up your fingerprint later."" I have cleaned my screen protector, washed and dried my hands, turned my phone on and off again, done it in all different light conditions and still. Fucking. NOTHING! It is driving me absolutely insane. This has now been going on for literal weeks. Does anyone have any idea why the hell this is happening and how to fix it? "
"Negative","AirPods 4 sounds bad in pixel 9 pro.Hi, is there any way to adjust the sound settings?They sound so bad right now. My previous Android phone I changed some sound settings but I can't find the same options in this phone. "
"Negative","My Google Pixel 7 phone died in front of my eyes, as it updated to Android 15.I've been in the Google ecosystem for years now, and have had Gioogle phones since they were called Nexus phones, starting by the Galaxy Nexus, then Nexus 4, and finally Nexus 6p.My current phone was a Google Pixel 7, and I absolutely loved it. Two days ago I woke up to go the washroom, and saw my phone notifying me that it would reboot soon to install Android 15. It was charging, so I figured, no problem, do your thing. I came back from the washroom to find the screen black, but with a backlight still. I thought it was rebooting, so I waited. The backlight eventually went away, and that was it. Since then I've been unable to turn it on at all. No recovery mode, bootloader screen, no \`adb devices\`, nothing. It's dead, not a single light or sign of life when I charge it or plug it into a PC.I took it to an authorized repair shop, they opened the phone, tried a new battery, no luck. Apparently the internals of the pixel are not modular at all. There's a battery module, a camera module, and ""everything else"" integrated into the motherboard.I'm devastated. ""New Phone Money"" is not something that comes easy to me these days, and this happening as part of an Android update pushed by google itself feels very wrong. I contacted the support and was told that my phone was out of warranty (I bought it in 2022), and that there's nothing they can do. I found this response infuriating and unfair. If a company is pushing OTA updates, the least it can do is offer a store credit for when these updates brick someone's phone.Anyhow, I don't mean to spread fear, and so far I was only able to find 3 other Pixel 7/7as that bricked during this update, so it's clearly not widespread enough for google to care I think."
"Negative","My Pixel 5 just died..Black screen, not charging.Nothing. No signs of life.Is it game over or is there some hope? Anything I should try?I have pixel 8 and 9 pro here so I'm not destitute.But my pixel 5 is a work horse. It was my go to in the office.I'm sad on valentine's day. 😭"
"Negative","Fingerpint Reader on Pixel 9 Much Worse than on Pixel 5.Hello, since we do not get security updates anymore for the Pixel 5, I was forced to upgrade to Pixel 9. it is OK in general, but feels more like a downgrade.Especially the fingerprint reader is horrible. It works like 70% of the time. This is absolutely not acceptable. I have tried to disable Adaptive Touch on Stock Android. I have tried also GrapheneOS with Increased Touch Sensitivity. It helped to come to the 70%, but are there other options which can be turned on/off?I have tried with and without screen protector. With its a bit kore accurate, but no where near 85% of the time unfortunately.On Pixel 5 it was accurate and worked in 99% of the time for me.Hope you can give some more tips, before selling my phone."
"Negative","sick of my pixel 8 pro already after only 5 days -software problems.So long story short. I bought a pixel 8 pro because of the cameras. I do youtube videos and wanted good cameras.  But i've only had it 5 days and already it given me loads of software problems. 1st won't recogise usb flash or external hard drives, so i can't them as external memory. Now it won't copy music, mps files from my other phone.What really annoys me, is i had my old Xiaomi poco f3 for 5 years and never had a problem with anything. Everything just worked on it.  If i keep having problems this will be the last pixel i ever buy. And lastly, i can see by how many people are posting about their problems here, so that's not only me. "
"Negative","Pixel 5 Battery Potentially Swelling.My Pixel 5's screen has become very loose and I've had to use tape to hold it down. I don't know if it's an issue with the glue weakining over time (my power button has also fallen out), or the battery on the inside is swelling, causing the screen to pop out. Last summer, my phone regularly got quite hot & the battery started to drain quickly which could also be battery related. My speakers are also very messed up & my volume buttons stop clicking properly which I don't know is related.I'm also aware that Google was offering free battery placements for Pixel 4a users because there was some issues with the batteries on those phone and I wonder if the same issue is affecting Pixel 5 users."
"Negative","Let me tell you a story of my mom losing EVERYTHING because her Pixel 6 decided to die. (And why you need to check your recovery options NOW.).I'm absolutely floored and frustrated, and I need to share this cautionary tale. My mom, mid-60s and not exactly a tech wizard, is currently locked out of her entire digital life, and it's all because her Google Pixel 6 decided to abruptly brick itself.Here's the breakdown:* **The Sudden Death:** A few days ago, her Pixel 6 just went dark. No warning, no signs. A lab couldn't revive it.* **The Recovery Nightmare:** My mom, bless her heart, apparently never set up a separate recovery email. Or, if she did, it was the same email she's now locked out of.* **The Google Voice Trap:** Her recovery phone number is her old US Google Voice number. She and my dad moved overseas less than a year ago and got a local number, but, as you can imagine, changing recovery numbers wasn't a priority for her.* **The Password Paradox:** She actually remembers her Google password, but it seems she got locked out after multiple attempts (or some other Google security measure). Now, it's forcing verification via that US Google Voice number, which is inaccessible because the phone is dead.* **The Chromebook Betrayal:** She has a Chromebook, which I thought would be a saving grace. Nope. It mysteriously signed her out, and it's also requiring verification via the same inaccessible number.* **The Fallout:** All her important accounts—health portals (MyChart), Facebook, everything—are tied to that Google account. She's essentially lost access to her medical records and social connections.I'm beyond frustrated. This is a complete disaster. We've opened a new email, but it's a band-aid on a gaping wound.Seriously, how is this not happening to more people, especially older folks? Phones can just die, and if you don't have robust recovery options, you're screwed.**My Plea to You:*** Go. Now. Check your recovery email and phone number. Make sure they're up-to-date and accessible.* Set up multiple recovery options.* Consider a legacy contact.* Get those authenticator app offline codes and store them somewhere safe.* Back up everything, and test your backups.* Educate your older family members.It's insane how much we rely on these devices and accounts, and how easily it can all be taken away.Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.TL;DR: Mom's Pixel 6 died, she's locked out of her Google account, and therefore, her entire digital life, because of outdated recovery info. Check your recovery options NOW."

"Negative","Pixel 7 Pro changes quick settings menu language randomly.As the title says the quick settings menu language changes randomly.  Except it technically isn't random.  It seems to happen overnight.  This is the second time in a row it's happened.  I have Japanese as a system language and a keyboard language.  The default language for my phone is English and the apps it allows me to change are set as such.  I like having Japanese as a system language because I do type in it sometimes.  But I never change it to be the language for my phone.  What's weird is that it only happens in the Quick Settings menu and Outlook.  If I kill Outlook and restart it that fixes it for that. But for my phone I have to restart it.  Has anyone else experienced this and resolved it?"

"Negative","Are Pixel phones just not built to last?.Let me clear, I have been a Google fanboy since 2013. Fantastic software in an affordable package with a great camera. As the techie in the family, my partner, mother, and father now have one. I started with Nexus 5 which made me drink the Google Kool-Aid. I drive a car from 2003 that I keep running. This laptop is over a decade old. I take care of things and expect my things to last. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be possible with Pixel phones.Flash forward to my next phone after the Nexus 5: The Nexus 5X. This phone was always in a case, I cleaned charging port regularly, no drops, screen protector etc. Nonetheless, it died a sudden premature death from the well known bootlooping issue. Google accepted responsibility and sent me a refurb. Faith in Google restored.Decided I wanted an upgrade, so I sprung for a Pixel 5a. Rear fingerprint sensor, great battery, aux port, software that can keep up with my usage. I had no intention of leaving this phone. Again, this phone was babied, has lived in a case, away from heat/moisture all the things. This morning I woke up, saw a text message and the phone suddenly froze and shut off. Could not revive the phone into recovery, computer cannot detect device, etc. It's clear that it's been a victim of the well documented motherboard defect. Google support will *not* accept responsibility (it's apparently two months outside extended warranty). So, my question to the community is: Are Pixel phones just not built to last? Ironically, my Nexus 5 (made by LG) is now housing my SIM card until I find a replacement. This phone was released in 2013 and has now been used *twice* as a backup once my Nexus 5X and Pixel 5A prematurely kicked the bucket. Am I just unlucky?  I've seen other documented motherboard faults with other newer Pixels as well. This does not inspire confidence to invest more money in the Pixel line. The 7 and 8 are both in my price range but the principle of owning a device that's a ticking time bomb with little or no manufacturer support tell me no.T;dr: My past two Google phones have each had manufacturer defects that bricked the device despite babying them. Are Pixel phones just not built to last? If not, what manufacturer (besides Apple) has better build quality?"
"Negative","Unfortunately, after 13 years, I'm leaving team Pixel..And I know you all don't care (I wouldn't). But I'm not happy that it came to this. I'm in love with Pixel phones, but P8 have a problem (known and well spread) that is making me change the brand.My last Pixel is Pixel 8 (after Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 4a, Pixel 6) and in last couple of months I'm having a problem with me being unavailable for gsm calls (or calls go to voicemail). My dad is terminally sick and I can't afford to lose calls at the moment. Seems there's no fix for this, so have to sell the phone. Don't know what I'm going to get, but something people can call me on, at least. This problem is really something I can't overlook, and will not be getting Pixel again.If you know the fix, which I couldn't find, please save me and help.Cheers friends."

But says its up to date even up to day. I notice on Google Full OTA Images [https://developers.google.com/android/ota#akita](https://developers.google.com/android/ota#akita) it shows 14 stops support at September 2024, then monthly patches are only coming out for 15.   So my question is that correct that after September 2024 there are no more security updates and my phone needs to go to 15 to start getting updates again?  Did Google pause 15 roll out until issues are resolved as I have read there have been some. I have tried every way possible (On wifi off wifi, on VPN off VPN) to check for updates and it keeps saying I am up to date. "
"Negative","Regret. Deep regret..// _RANT_ //I had an iPhone 14 first, but returned it because of the lack of external apps.Bought a Pixel 8. Came with a watch free, which is okay, randomly dies sometimes but it's all right. I am now having deep and maddening regret of my choice. Mostly because now I have a Mac so the ecosystem would rock. I have lost so many things too. 1. The taptic engine is really good, I just prefer it opposed to the pixel. 2. I live outside the US so most of the features don't work for me. 3. Love the control I have over my phone. Sometimes. Because when an idiot like me is given the choice to change so many things about something so integral to life- I am going to mess it up. 4. Kinda forgot that 90% of everyone I meet has an iPhone- so I lose my airdrop, the touch to transfer thingy, iMessage (big one and I can't get it to work on mac). 5. Developers for iPhone are governed by apple's stringent quality control. 6. iPhone is wildly popular and widely documented. Almost all your issues are probably covered somewhere on the interweb, which is not the case for pixel. 7. Apples design is clean, and personally I prefer it to pixel's design. There's way more reasons but can't think of em rn. So I'm trying and looking around on how to switch back- but every option looks expensive.Only thing I'll really, really miss is the pixel's camera, the look of which I love. But I'll probably find some raw capture app on the app store to try and recoup that. Just irritated atp."

"Negative","(USA) Google Wallet and Android 15 new NFC default app ""none"".TLDR; I just set the default NFC app to ""none"" but not been anywhere yet to try it out. Will it stop NFC payment from going through until a payment app is open?    Pixel 8a, Android 15. I don't need or want NFC to work for payment unless I have already opened google wallet app (even if the phone is already unlocked).     In the past, my phone had to be unlocked (as per the setting to require unlock) but my payment app (Google Wallet) did NOT have to be open for NFC payment to go through. I didn't much care for that behavior, but it wasn't an issue because the devices I encountered always needed to be within several inches of my phone.     Lately I am finding more and more devices that engage my phone from well over a foot away. I came very close to paying for another customer's purchase last week, thankfully my phone had been unlocked for a little while as I was using my shopping list, I have biometrics on and was prompted for my fingerprint to verify my identity before making a purchase.     So now I really really really don't want NFC payment capability unless I have already opened the Wallet app (or any other payment app, should I ever have multiple). Will this default app setting of ""none"" achieve it?"
"Negative","Why doesn't the latest Pixel on Android 15 have an option to require a password before powering down the phone?.With Android 15, Google has introduced several theft protection features like Theft Detection Lock and Remote Lock. However, there seems to be a glaring security gap: there is no option to require authentication (e.g., a password or PIN) when accessing the power menu to shut down the device. This omission allows thieves to quickly power off a stolen phone, disabling tracking features like ""Find My Device.""While third-party apps claim to address this issue, they are ineffective on Pixel devices due to system-level restrictions. Why hasn’t Google implemented such a basic feature, especially when it could significantly enhance security? Is there any workaround or hope for this feature in future updates?"

Man I hate Google so much!!!.So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go ""Is that child porn?"" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here ""A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious."" [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said ""Why should other people have more privacy than I do?"" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer ""only store passwords locally on device"" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable ""Advanced Data Protection"" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself; this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account. So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!! We have a right to privacy.This is the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

"Negative","Is there a way to avoid backing up camera with Google photos?.Is there a way to avoid backing up camera roll with Google photos? I bought a 256 GB phone so I wouldn't have to deal with paying a monthly cloud fee. ( I realize I have the 1 year trial of Google 1 with 1TB storage, but I don't want to get stuck using too much storage at the end of the trial and end up paying the $30 a month or whatever it is after the trial) I currently have backup turned off and deleted a bunch of stuff from the Google photos website to clear up cloud space but it keeps turning back on automatically and re backuping everything filling my cloud account and threatening my email. Plus in googles tutorial on how ""how to delete photos/videos"" it says in it something along the lines of ""if you turn back up back in you may risk your previous photos before backed up or deleted from device"" I have tried looking for a way to just turn off backing up the camera folder by itself, but the only options I have to toggle individually are screenshots, quick share, messages, and movies. Camera is not an option If anyone has suggestions on something I'm missing as to why backup keeps turning on or if there is a way to just turn off the camera roll it'd be greatly appreciated!!!Thanks!"
"Negative","I absolutely Hate my Pixel 9 Pro, Please Help..Coming from a Galaxy phone/watch/smart devices has been miserable.  Nothing works properly.

It's complete bullshit that I can answer a call on the phone itself and then have to spend the next 30 seconds panicking with the person on the other end to figure out which damn device its going through.  Usually my Watch or Car Stereo.    WHYYYY!!!!Not to mention the display on my phone will cut in and out while its ringing like the caller is hanging up and trying again repeatedly.

"Negative","Google Photos Just Erased 2 Years.I was accidentally conned into deleting photos I thought were on the Google Cloud.

"Negative","Google Photos Just Erased 2 Years.I was accidentally conned into deleting photos I thought were on the Google Cloud. Google was telling me I was 45 GB over my storage limit and I had to clear out storage if I wanted to get use of Gmail again. So I went through and deleted things I already knew existed on my phone and my iCloud. However what Google neglected to tell me was that what actually happened was when I installed Google Photos it came with automatic backup which they don’t ask permission to turn on anymore, which filled my Google Cloud storage quickly. Then they told me that I needed to clear out 45 GB of photo and video files to get down under the limit or purchase more storage space in the cloud for $19.99. When I found out that I had deleted 2 years of photos and videos from my device I went to the Google Photos App and went to the trash folder and selected “Restore All” and nothing happened. I tried a second time and this time everything disappeared and has not returned to my Google Photos library nor the device’s. Google does say in the trash section of their Photos app that all photos will be available for 60 days after they are deleted from Google Photos. Apparently this is a lie.I went to having 20,000 pictures and videos on my phone to less than half that and it seems like Google is deleting more on their own as we speak pictures that I took this afternoon that were in my photo library are no longer there.Is there anything I can do, Google for one deleted pictures of my daughter from ages 5-7 and many other memories from someone who will in the not to distant future lack the ability to recall any of them on my own. They also promised the photos would be available up to 60 days after deleting and they couldn’t even last 12 hours. They also forced me to pay to upgrade my storage to be able to restore them. They didn’t provide the service I paid them for, they actually took my money and deleted my memories."

"Negative","I regret buying an iPhone.I’ve regretted buying an iPhone (iPhone 13) for the past seven months now. Before that, I had a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. I bought it because I had always used Android (from different brands) and wanted a change. At the time, no Android phone really appealed to me, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try something different. That’s how I ended up getting a refurbished iPhone 13.Here’s what disappointed me:	•	First thing: I bought it in pink, but it actually looks more white than pink (not a big deal, but still).	•	I almost always keep my phone on silent since I spend most of my time in class or at work, and I find the notification system absolutely terrible. There’s no small icon at the top of the screen, and notifications barely show up on the lock screen, so I have to manually check for them multiple times a day. Because of that, I sometimes receive messages and completely forget to reply.	•	I don’t understand why my home screen wallpaper is blurry. I don’t want it to be blurry, and I don’t know if there’s a way to fix it in the settings. Either way, I shouldn’t have to dig through settings just to correct something like this.	•	When I turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, why does it only stay off until the next day before turning itself back on?? I get that maybe it’s to prevent unnecessary data usage, and sure, maybe I could change this in the settings, but I don’t want to constantly mess around in the settings for basic things like this!	•	When I watch a YouTube video in landscape mode while lying in bed, the screen doesn’t automatically rotate. I have to exit fullscreen and reopen it for the orientation to be correct.	•	Honestly, I thought I’d get used to it, but I hate swiping to go back. When I’m watching slideshows on TikTok, it’s annoying to have to stretch my hand all the way to the edge of the screen just to go back—it’s just not practical.	•	In general, there are so many restrictions on what I can do, and I constantly feel like the phone is preventing me from using it how I want.	•	The mute switch on the left side: I find it super impractical. I have to fidget with it to know if my phone is on silent, and sometimes there’s a delay (though I wonder if that’s because my phone is refurbished and maybe the switch is faulty).	•	To adjust notification or alarm volume, I have to go back to the home screen because if an app is open, I can’t adjust the system volume directly.	•	Face ID: I don’t know if mine is buggy, but a friend who has always used iPhones tried it and said it was normal, so I guess that’s just how it works. But personally, I find it super slow; sometimes it doesn’t work, and when I’m lying down, it doesn’t always recognize me. I had to make a Reddit post complaining about Face ID just for someone to tell me that when unlocking my phone, I could tap “Face ID” to enter my passcode faster. Like… it’s written nowhere that I could do that. How was I supposed to guess??	•	The photos honestly aren’t that impressive. I compared them to my 2018 Galaxy S8, and while they’re decent quality, they’re nothing incredible. In fact, I find them a bit dull.	•	There are no numbers displayed at the top of my keyboard.	•	When I log into something and receive an SMS code, I have to tap on it manually to autofill it, whereas even my 2018 Galaxy S8 did this automatically. (Okay, maybe I’m nitpicking here, but still.)	•	To turn off my phone, I have to press the power button AND volume up at the same time. The first time, I had to ask a friend for help because I just couldn’t figure it out. I mean, if there’s a power button, logically, holding it should turn the phone off.	•	The default calculator app is garbage, right? I’m a waitress, and I use my phone’s calculator to count my cash register at the end of the night. Who thought it was a good idea to remove the calculation history?? I don’t get it. They want the phone to be so sleek and minimalist that it actually becomes unusable. I had to download a separate calculator app, which is just ridiculous.	•	When someone calls me, there’s no direct “Decline” button on the screen. Again, not a big deal, but I find it inconvenient.	•	The phone gets scratched super easily. When I first got it, I had to use it for two days without a case because mine hadn’t arrived yet. Despite being careful, the metal edges already got scratched, and I have no idea how.	•	The snooze lasts 9 minutes??	•	Writing and editing text on an iPhone is unnecessarily complicated.	•	I can’t close all my browser tabs at once.I know that a lot of these issues can probably be fixed in the settings, but:	1.	I shouldn’t have to dig through settings for things that, to me, should be basic.	2.	A brand-new iPhone is ridiculously expensive. I’m so glad I didn’t buy the latest model, because for the price, this phone should be reading my mind.To give you an idea: in the first month, I was so disappointed compared to everything iPhone fans had told me that I actually went to an Apple Store to check if my phone was even real.I know I’m complaining about a lot of little things, and maybe I’m just used to Android, which makes some things stand out more. But considering the insane price of an iPhone, I feel like I have every right to nitpick.Anyway, I think I’ll sell my phone this summer. (I hate doing that; I’ve always used my phones until they were completely broken.) But I just can’t see myself keeping it. I’ll get something else instead.Edit: I also want to say that I don’t like not being able to place my app icons on the home screen wherever I want. I don’t get it—the phone costs an entire month’s salary. If I’m paying that much and I want a page with a big empty space in the middle with no apps, I should have the right to do that, right?? I swear, I constantly feel like there’s someone stopping me from using my phone the way I want for no valid reason."

One of my doubts is the software, since I got my first smartphone I always got Samsung phones I don't realy know why but happens, I was always a bit bias towards them, but this last years the underdogs start  to catch up, my only doubt is if the software is quick, fluid and is it is, stays that way or get slow easily?    Btw one think that got me mad with my current phone is that sometimes during pokemon go, appears a blue line on the bottom, like notifying of  something and disappears but the performance in game gets worse, my only guess is that the phone is getting to much hot, and the software cuts the performance to lower temperature, but is realy annoying I  preferred to gt just notified that the phone is getting hot and I choose what to do.I hope you guys can help me decide, don't just say ""buy this one"" explain why I should buy that one.Thank you all!"

Im an avid traveller and like to record my moments in the best camera's possible. But im recently very worried about the choice im going to make between the iphone 16 pro max and Samsung s24 ultra. I have used the Samsung s21+ for a year or so and it didn't really cherish my hunger for the camera department. And im really torn between the s24 ultra and iPhone debate. I'm really confused that is the iphone video recording really that superior or is it just a minor difference between these two. According to many YouTube videos there's some minor differences but I'm real torn between this topic. For my needs i would really prefer an android over an iphone. As i like to customise my phone and use off loaded apps alot.I wont go for any other companies as I want a reliable ui and fun to use ui.So what would your opinions be about this topic.

"Negative","If iOS suddendly included a Back button, would you consider switching? If not, what are your other pet peeves?.Today I was thinking about how similar iOS and Android are today, but at the same time, it's crazy that small details make all the difference.My biggest pet peeve with iOS is the lack of a Back button.I often look at people in public transport, to see how they manage to go back with iPhones.No matter if they are young or old, male or female, the Back gesture works 80% of the time for them.It's just that they're used to it, so if it fails, they immediately do it again.I don't think that's a nice user experience for such a common action.If only it was as simple as doing the gesture! No.. no.. Sometimes the gesture doesnt work just because the developer of the app didn't implement it. Then you learn you can only tap the arrow button on the top left, Sometimes you realize you can only continue with the flow of the app (eg tapping Next).Sometimes you realize the gesture doesnt work because there's a Done/Cancel text button at the top right corner.Now, even if they fixed that mess and added a navigation bar like on Android, there are still pet peeves that would keep me from moving:1. You can't plug an iPhone to a PC and expect to see files and folders. You need to use iTunes.2. You can't safely charge an iPhone with a wireless charger that isn't an original Apple one ($40), as the phone can get crazy hot; even without a case. 3. The notifications are hard to dismiss. You need to do a weird swipe down to expose that view, and then a broad gesture to dismiss it towards the bottom.4. No double tap to turn off the screen and lock.5. Face id forces you to pick up the phone. So, no unlocking when it's flat on a table, unless you awkwardly reach out to show your face.What am I missing?"
"Negative","So, what IS going on with this ""pink line"" screen issue that seems to be happening on every phone?.For years users have experienced their screens slowly dieing on them.

I've submitted an RMA which Google even made a [specific page for](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15009955?hl=en).So apparently, this is a world wide phenomenon that happens to a lot of users, no matter which brand or model. Something must be wrong here. Clearly the screen is prone to this, yet no manufacturer seems to care enough to get it fixed completely? They all mutually agree to just repair/replace the units that people RMA. Google offers a free RMA, Samsung seems to be charging about 50 dollars last I saw online.Anyway, just wanted to pop in and share this. It's weird."

I also have an emergency ID that can be accessed in an emergency.I’m sure I could track all of this data with specific apps, but would it mean multiple apps?The Apple Health app will analyze trends and tell me when something is going up or down.

"Negative","I tried an iPhone after 10 years with android.Hello everyone, as the title says, I tried to do this change because iOS 18 to me looked very promising and also more and more people are switching to iPhone so i wanted to give it a chance. To be clear, I also have an ipad, so i thought that the experience would not be so much different (i have to say that i use it only for studying so my experience was not so much deep).I was very, very wrong. First week having this iPhone was very satisfying and simple. But after that the experience became...complicated.The gesture in long term are really annoying, they are not universal... And you cannot close all the app in one tap. Widgets started to glitch out, becoming completely white randomly. The audio of videos had a weird, loud, static sound especially when using ultra wide.The alarm clock doesn't make any sense: WHY THE SNOOZE IS ONLY 9 MINUTES AND IT'S BIG LIKE THE ENTIRE SCREEN?!No multitasking, no pop up Windows, horrible notification system... In general I found the experience with iPhone a bit underwhelming and disappointing. Now I'm switching back to Android, for now I'm using an old Mi 11 Lite 5g and, i have to say, even if its a cheap phone is better than using iOS. "

However, since I paid via Apple Pay, they **can’t refund me directly** and told me to request it from Apple.Here’s everything I’ve tried so far, but I’m stuck:1. **Developer agrees** that the app doesn’t work on my Mac and supports my refund, but Apple controls the transaction.2. **Apple denied my refund request twice** via [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com), so I can’t submit another one.3. **Apple support says they can’t help.**4. **I filed a complaint with the BBB**, but Apple gave me a generic response refusing the refund.5. **I emailed** [**tcook@apple.com**](mailto:tcook@apple.com) – it’s been **two weeks with no response**.6. **I paid with an Apple Gift Card**, so I **can’t dispute the charge through my bank**.I specifically bought the app **through the Mac App Store instead of the developer’s website** because I trusted Apple to provide a safety net. Instead, it’s becoming an **obstacle to getting my money back**.I’ve seen **many similar experiences**, and it’s shocking that Apple, as a platform, can **enforce such one-sided policies** without accountability.👉 **Do I have any options left, or do I just accept the loss 💢**"

I fixed that by replacing the adapter with one of a higher rating. However, with the iPhone 16e, that change wouldn’t make any difference because the phone itself limits the input."

"Negative","I'm trying to find a childhood iOS game I used to play on my iPod Touch about 10+ years ago.I'm searching for a side-scrolling shooter game from my childhood. The player character was positioned in the bottom left corner of the screen and could throw grenades or fire anti-aircraft guns. There was an ""AIRSTRIKE"" button in the top right corner that would call in a screen-wide bombing run. At regular intervals, a large bomber would appear at the top of the screen.The game featured soldier characters, and enemies included ground troops and twin-rotor transport helicopters. Around the third or fourth level, the setting would change to an urban environment where enemy forces included large tanks.The graphics were a little bit of pixelated/retro style. There was no upgrade system or multiplayer mode, and it used touchscreen controls. Unfortunately, this game has been removed from the App Store for many years now.Does anyone recognize this game? It's a cherished childhood memory and I'd love to know its name!"
"Negative","For the 16e haters, I am that weirdo it was made for! Hear me now!.I realize that among the august and gilded community that constitutes r/iphone, the following will seem like the ravings of a madman. But yes, I am that weirdo who has read all the criticism and is still ready to pull the trigger on the iPhone 16e with confidence, and I am here to stop the hate (although, to be clear, I have no love for Apple or any corporation for that matter).My context: I am still using an iPhone SE. The original. That's right, not the 2020, not the SE 3, but the one that started the lineage. I still remember the day, almost 10 years ago, walking into the the flagship store on Infinity Loop in Cupertino to replace an ailing 4s. Since then...My iPhone has been fallen off the second story of a houseSunk to the bottom of a hot spring in YosemiteRemined functional in 120**°** F heat in the Mohave desert (heat wave 2022)Remained functional in -6**°** F crazy freezing temperatures in Canada (last week)Been trampled by a heaving rush at New Delhi Station (if you know, you know)Approached both the lowest and highest elevations on earthGot immersed in all manner of dust, sand, liquids and, uh, other stuffSpent months in places with average humidity levels of 90%Experienced several power surges while charging (thank you Third World hostels)Outlived four Belkin cases, three lightning cables, and two pairs of plugin EarPodsAll the while never going in for a repair or battery replacement. All the while doing all the things I need a phone to do (including being a vital tool in the collection and documentation of fieldwork data for a doctoral dissertation)And still it soldiers on!My last iOS update was in July and I have been holding out since then for the ""new SE"" because even this old diehard is starting to show its age. But even this lowliest of iPhone has stood the test of time and proven its enduring value. And also, after a disastrous experience with an Android circa 2011 I'm never going back to that hot mess.In a few short days I will pay $599 for an iPhone 16e. In 2016 I paid $449 for an SE with 64gb of storage. Adjusting for inflation, that was $602 in 2025 dollars. And so, for effectively $3 dollars less than I paid for my last iPhone, I will be getting a 16e with:Double the storage / quadruple the ram / quadruple the GPUs / USB-C (thank goodness) / something called Apple Intelligence / and a device that I suppose is more in line with the typical smartphone experience in the 2020sAm I still getting a bad deal?Yes, I am a weirdo. I did not really know what MagSafe was until I looked up 16e reviews last week (still don't care, sorry not sorry). I confine my gaming to a proper, high performance laptop, thank you very much. I watch movies in my living room on a bigscreen. I leave the photographs for a DSLR. I seek devices with durability and futureproofing, and to those ends Apple has earned my trust.There are many like me, believe it or not, we just don't post on reddit or tech websites about our phones. So stop the hate, and here's to 10 more years!"

I used it only indoors, only sitting on my desk and to my huge surprise yesterday when I cleaned the screen before installing the proctector I was shocked to see many small scratches and one tiny chip on the screen.I did drop the phone once from the desk, but that was drop from 70cm on a bunch of cables (there is mess around my desk …) and it did slide form the cables to wooden floor, I didn’t consider that as a dangerous incident, turned out to be for the screen …I checked my 3 years old iPhone 13 Pro and there is hardly any scratch, none when comparing to my 4 days old 16 pro.

"Negative","The impossibility of recording a concert with the iPhone 15 Pro Max..After recording a concert with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, all sounds come through normally in shots taken without zoom. However, as soon as I zoom in beyond 1x, the audio completely changes and becomes muffled. Since the person on stage is using a microphone and their voice comes from the speakers, that sound disappears as well. Additionally, the entire band's background music becomes muffled. My entire concert recording is ruined.For the next concert, I followed everyone's recommendation and switched the recording audio to mono, but that didn’t work either. I also tried disabling sound isolation, as suggested by other sources, but that didn’t help.The only solution for now seems to be recording the concert audio separately with another phone. Thanks, Apple! I can’t even record a concert properly with my $1,000 phone.You're questioning why I record concerts with my phone, ruining the experience for others and not living in the moment, but you don't say a word about how a phone ruins all the sound when zooming in.# My mom had a small performance, and I wanted to record it as a memory to watch whenever I wanted. It wasn't a big artist's concert, as you might assume.Now that I've explained this, can we focus on the main issue: why does a phone I paid over $1000 for completely ruin all the sound when I zoom in?The same thing happened during cinematic recording as well."

"Negative","iPhone 16 Pro Charging Port Melted.I recently posted about my charging port melting. People were quick to blame me instead of Apple.I contacted Apple directly who received images of the damage. They escalated it to their engineering team who concluded moisture or dust caused the issue and that this was user error.When I contacted Apple Norway they were shocked about the outcome, this was against Norwegian, and EU law, but since this was escalated to the highest level of Apple they had no authority on the matter.I reached out to Norwegian News Media who made a news articleApple concluded that the charging equipment used had no relevance, the heat was generated in the phone and caused by a short circuit. Given that it is IP68, and phones are exposed to dust everyday, not taking this more seriously is absolutely insane, and a potential safety hazard. As you can see in the pictures from the news article, this was NOT a dirty phoneI did get this fixed going through my home insurance, but Apple was not at all willing to help, and did not at all take this seriously. I spoke to Kashif from Apples Executive Relations who dismissed it entirely even though this would have been a house fire, and potentially fatal if I did not notice this as early as I did (0-3min after it began happening)"

"Negative","The iPhone 16e isn’t a bad phone… it’s a bad value..https://preview.redd.it/40q0m2kcz8ke1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ca3da27326baca97bc51d71c77f2956059c1d50Since 2016, Apple has been giving us the iPhone SE, a $399 parts binned iPhone to get the android users into the Apple ecosystem. The issue at time was that since it was a parts binned phone, it looked dated even though it had their fastest SOC of that time in it. It was a great budget offering by Apple to be a gateway device into the Apple Ecosystem. Further they increased the price of the iPhone SE3 to $429 in 2022. No Biggie.With the launch of the iPhone 16e, the “SUCCESSOR” of the iPhone SE series, Apple lost the game big time. First, they killed both the iPhone SE series and the iPhone 14 series and positioned (price-wise) the iPhone 16e at $599 which was the price of the iPhone 14 a day before. With the removal of the iPhone SE series the entry price to the Apple ecosystem starts at $599. Now starting at $599 isn’t a bad thing at all, the issue is that Apple is giving it a bad value. Apple has positioned the iPhone 16e as a Price Anchor just to make the value of the iPhone 15 series and iPhone 16 series that much more attractive. Apple wants us to compare it with the iPhone SE, but it’s true comparison should be with the iPhone 14 which the iPhone 16e is a Price Replacement of.    Comparison with the iPhone 14: * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* *Has A18 SOC** *Has USB Type-C** *Has Action Button** *Has A18 SOC*Comparison with the iPhone 15 (+$100): * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* Lower Max Brightness* No Wifi 7 Support* No Dynamic Island* No Threads Networking Support* *Has A18 SOC*Comparison with the iPhone 16 (+$200): * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* Lower Max Brightness* No Wifi 7 Support* No Dynamic Island* No Threads Networking Support* No Camera Control Button* No Photographic Styles* Higher Minimum Brightness* No Spacial Photo/Video* Last Generation Ceramic Shield.Now with these comparisons out of the way, the iPhone 16e isn’t looking too good especially which kept against the iPhone 14 that it’s directly replacing in terms of price. The iPhone 15 at $699, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with Apple’s A16 SOC compared to iPhone 16e’s A18 SOC and No Apple Intelligence Features. It further looks even more appealing when compared against the iPhone 16 at $799, a $200 price jump. You for sure are getting a lot for $200 more.    The iPhone 16e is in no way a BAD PHONE, it’s NOT a phone that no one should buy, it’s just a terrible value. There have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iPhone 16 and the price hasn’t come down accordingly. This exact same phone at $499 would have been an excellent deal and Apple would have had another Mac Mini M4 moment. At $599, it just too expensive for the amount of features missing. On a brighter note, It might have the longest battery life amongst the iPhone 16 series.    Would I recommend the iPhone 16e? For most people, No! It’s absolutely not worth it. However I would recommend this iPhone for the elders in your family, the people who need longer battery life, longer support life with software updates, for those who have gotten used to iOS and who use an iPhone only for FaceTime or iMessages and would find it hard to migrate to Android. To everyone else, It’s just not worth it. If you’re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iPhone, I would highly recommend that you check third-party stores, as they’ll be clearing out their iPhone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price. For the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iPhone, (I can’t believe Apple’s price Anchor strategy is working here) I suggest you save a little more and go for the iPhone 16, It’s a way better deal as compared to the iPhone 16e.Finally I’ll end with a prediction, The next iPhone in Apple’s ‘e’ series, presumably iPhone 17e would come back to earth with it’s pricing to $499, and Apple is gonna use it a selling point. “Apple’s Most Affordable iPhone, Now Even Cheaper” or something cheesy like that."

"Negative","The iPhone 16e isn’t a bad phone… it’s a bad value..https://preview.redd.it/40q0m2kcz8ke1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ca3da27326baca97bc51d71c77f2956059c1d50Since 2016, Apple has been giving us the iPhone SE, a $399 parts binned iPhone to get the android users into the Apple ecosystem. The issue at time was that since it was a parts binned phone, it looked dated even though it had their fastest SOC of that time in it. It was a great budget offering by Apple to be a gateway device into the Apple Ecosystem. Further they increased the price of the iPhone SE3 to $429 in 2022. No Biggie.With the launch of the iPhone 16e, the “SUCCESSOR” of the iPhone SE series, Apple lost the game big time. First, they killed both the iPhone SE series and the iPhone 14 series and positioned (price-wise) the iPhone 16e at $599 which was the price of the iPhone 14 a day before. With the removal of the iPhone SE series the entry price to the Apple ecosystem starts at $599. Now starting at $599 isn’t a bad thing at all, the issue is that Apple is giving it a bad value. Apple has positioned the iPhone 16e as a Price Anchor just to make the value of the iPhone 15 series and iPhone 16 series that much more attractive. Apple wants us to compare it with the iPhone SE, but it’s true comparison should be with the iPhone 14 which the iPhone 16e is a Price Replacement of.    Comparison with the iPhone 14: * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* *Has A18 SOC** *Has USB Type-C** *Has Action Button** *Has A18 SOC*Comparison with the iPhone 15 (+$100): * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* Lower Max Brightness* No Wifi 7 Support* No Dynamic Island* No Threads Networking Support* *Has A18 SOC*Comparison with the iPhone 16 (+$200): * No MagSafe* No Ultrawide Camera* No Macro Photography* No Cinematic Mode* No Action Mode* No Sensor Shift Optical Image Stabilization* 1 less GPU core* No 15 Watt Wireless charging* No Ultra Wideband Chip* No Millimeter Wave 5G bands supported* No Color Options other that Black or White* Lower Max Brightness* No Wifi 7 Support* No Dynamic Island* No Threads Networking Support* No Camera Control Button* No Photographic Styles* Higher Minimum Brightness* No Spacial Photo/Video* Last Generation Ceramic Shield.Now with these comparisons out of the way, the iPhone 16e isn’t looking too good especially which kept against the iPhone 14 that it’s directly replacing in terms of price. The iPhone 15 at $699, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16e looks really tempting while keeping in mind the it being a 18 month old phone comes with Apple’s A16 SOC compared to iPhone 16e’s A18 SOC and No Apple Intelligence Features. It further looks even more appealing when compared against the iPhone 16 at $799, a $200 price jump. You for sure are getting a lot for $200 more.    The iPhone 16e is in no way a BAD PHONE, it’s NOT a phone that no one should buy, it’s just a terrible value. There have been a lot of corners cut to make it a distinct downgrade from the iPhone 16 and the price hasn’t come down accordingly. This exact same phone at $499 would have been an excellent deal and Apple would have had another Mac Mini M4 moment. At $599, it just too expensive for the amount of features missing. On a brighter note, It might have the longest battery life amongst the iPhone 16 series.    Would I recommend the iPhone 16e? For most people, No! It’s absolutely not worth it. However I would recommend this iPhone for the elders in your family, the people who need longer battery life, longer support life with software updates, for those who have gotten used to iOS and who use an iPhone only for FaceTime or iMessages and would find it hard to migrate to Android. To everyone else, It’s just not worth it. If you’re on a tight budget and absolutely need an iPhone, I would highly recommend that you check third-party stores, as they’ll be clearing out their iPhone 14 series stock and maybe you could get it at an even cheaper price. For the rest of you who need an upgrade or a new iPhone, (I can’t believe Apple’s price Anchor strategy is working here) I suggest you save a little more and go for the iPhone 16, It’s a way better deal as compared to the iPhone 16e.Finally I’ll end with a prediction, The next iPhone in Apple’s ‘e’ series, presumably iPhone 17e would come back to earth with it’s pricing to $499, and Apple is gonna use it a selling point. “Apple’s Most Affordable iPhone, Now Even Cheaper” or something cheesy like that."
"Negative","Damaged iPhone now in China (see caption).I’ve seen people post that their phone got stolen and ended up in China. Mine was damaged and I had to send it back in order to get a replacement, and it’s now in China??? Very clearly still logged into my iCloud. I sent it back over a month ago, and the address it was shipped to wasn’t China. I saw the return address myself as I’m the one who shipped it. I could understand if they send damaged iPhones there to be repaired, but if it was legit being refurbished to be reused then why wouldn’t the Apple employees, or whoever, reset the phone so that it’s no longer logged into my iCloud? I didn’t erase it before returning because the screen was damaged beyond use, so there was no way for me to do so. I know I can remove my iCloud from the device, I more so just want to know why this has happened. "

I marked it as ""Lost"", however a few minutes ago the status on Find My changed and now it says it will be removed on March 16?https://preview.redd.it/c6q9rsxd21je1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e268a178646eb9ebc1a5ca981344fb6c8ab675Can I do anything to stop it from removing it? Since I'm guessing after the removal the phone will be as good as new for the thieve to sell it, help please, thanks!"
