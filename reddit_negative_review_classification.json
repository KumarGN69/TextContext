        "user_review":"80% of American teens buy iPhones. After I switched to Pixel, I'm convinced Samsung is why..People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.",

        "user_review":"Long Post Ahead \u2013 My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User.Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!  ",

        "user_review":"Google has created a privacy nightmare with Google Password Manager that will store all of your passwords in the cloud, you cannot opt to \"only have your passwords stored locally on device\", Google will only let you store your passwords in the cloud. Man I hate Google so much!!!.So I was installing facebook messenger on my Google pixel android smartphone and when I got to the part where I enter my password for facebook messenger, Google asked me to save my password to Google Password Manager so I can use my password on all devices, so it stored my password in the cloud. There is no way to opt out of this. There is no option to only store my password locally on my device and NOT in the cloud.Google is ramming this down our throats.This is a privacy nightmare! So check it out, when you upload a pic or vid to google cloud guess what happens, well first, google will have AI look at your pics and vids to look for child porn (they run your files against a hash value system, all internet companies do this). Google even takes this a step further than other companies, google now has an AI that will look at your uploaded pics and vids and go \"Is that child porn?\" If the AI determines that it is indeed child porn, then that AI will tell a human to come look at it.So this is separate from the hash value system. Google has an AI that will simply look at your pics and vids and try to determine if it's CP or not.And this has happened to innocent people who simply uploaded naked pics of their toddler children. The google AI deemed it to be CP and then flagged it so a human could look at it and then guess what? The fucking human called the cops on these innocent people. And apart from calling the cops, google also locked these people out of their google accounts so they lost access to precious valuable family photos and what not they had stored in their google cloud account. Family pics they'll never got back cause Google is evil like that.You can read more about it here \"A Dad Took Photos of His Naked Toddler for the Doctor. Google Flagged Him as a Criminal. Google has an automated tool to detect abusive images of children. But the system can get it wrong, and the consequences are serious.\"\u00a0[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/21\/technology\/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html)So Steve Jobs once famously said, and I might not get this quote right word for word but he said \"Why should other people have more privacy than I do?\" So Steve Jobs was big on privacy and so this is why when you upload pics and vids to Apple cloud, Apple DOES NOT automatically scan them for child porn. And that is because when you upload files to your Apple cloud account, it's end to end encrypted so Apple could not get access to your files even if someone held a gun to their head. Because it's end to end encrypted.A while back Apple was going to begin scanning files for child porn, they were going to do this locally on your device before the files were sent to Apple cloud but there was a massive outcry from the privacy community over this so Apple backed down.So listen, google does indeed encrypt your information that's stored in the cloud but they hold the encryption keys so they can decrypt and look at your stuff anytime they want to (and they do this cause from I understand they periodically scan your stuff looking for child porn or scan it for whatever reason they want). Whereas Apple can't decrypt your stuff cause they use end to end encryption. Only you have the password to your Apple cloud account, only you have the encryption key.And hey if I'm wrong about anything here then please let me know. I appreciate feedback.I'm so pissed off about this. Yeah google is ramming Google Password Manager down our throats. They could easily give you the option to only store your passwords locally on device but of course google doesn't wanna do that. Why would they do that? They want your information.I mean this is a privacy nightmare, so if the police want to (and they do this all the time) they will tell Google to give them access to all of your google accounts, so whatever information google has about you, the police get to see this. And the police do this if they are investigating you. So this would mean the cops would get all of your passwords that you use to login to facebook, reddit, X, instagram, tiktok, whatever app you use, they get access to your passwords cause your passwords are now stored in google cloud.So the government can now get access to your passwords (cause the police are agents of the government) that you use to login to everything so you see how this is a privacy nightmare? And also what if google gets hacked?At this point I will most likely get rid of my android smartphone and go get an Apple iPhone. Google has no respect for your privacy at all.The reason I haven't already jumped over to an iPhone is cause the iPhone doesn't have a dedicated back button or a dedicated app selector button. On my android smartphone at the very bottom of the screen you'll see three buttons, from left to right you got a dedicated back button, a dedicated home button, and a dedicated app selector button. Apple can be weird sometimes, they don't have a dedicated back or app selector button.But this is the last straw Google!!!!!! I'm gonna have to jump over to iPhone at this point. Fuck you Google.I don't want my passwords stored in the cloud. I want my passwords only stored locally on device. I want what emails and passwords I use to login to these various different apps to be stored locally on device and not in the cloud.So there might be a way to only store your passwords locally on device but Google is purposely making it very confusing to do this. I know cause I've checked the settings. Google is purposely making it confusing cause why? Cause they want your data that's why! Fuck Google.You'd think they'd offer \"only store passwords locally on device\" but nope, why would Google do that?From Google AI Overview:While\u00a0not all Apple Cloud data is automatically end-to-end encrypted, you can enable \"Advanced Data Protection\" to achieve a high level of end-to-end encryption for most of your iCloud data, including photos, backups, notes, and more, meaning only you have the keys to access your information, not even Apple itself;\u00a0this feature is optional and requires you to set up a recovery method in case you lose access to your account.\u00a0So yes Apple does have end to end encryption for iCloud but apparently it's NOT on by default. Tim Cook you bastard that should be turned on by default. RESPECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY!!! We have a right to privacy.This is the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.",

I am sick of Apple locking features to the latest models what seems to be all the time now. I totally understand features that require the additional computational power the new chipset provides but sometimes it feels like there is no rhyme or reason. What is this like on the Pixel lineup? I ask this because generally I update my phone every two years (and therefore skip every second model).2. This is the one that annoys me the most because I see absolutely no reason for it. It seems Apple is getting worse at geoblocking particular features or they are not as demonstrated where I am in Australia. Again, I understand some of the health stuff requires different approvals and totally understand that but some of the geoblocking again makes no sense. What is this like on the Pixel Lineup.There are some other reasons why I am annoyed. I keep a keen interest in AI. The AI implementation has been poor and staggered and I don't particularly like OpenAI as a company. The main reason I have stuck with it so long is that I value their more privacy focused approach with things like E2E encryption on drive, photos etc as well as the iMessage lock-in but keen to hear if the Pixel Lineup has these similar problems before I go and drop some cash on a Pixel, new headphones and change all my subscriptions.",

I am done with unstable unreliable software..I am moving away from Google and transition to Apple, despite the substantial cost involved in switching ecosystems and given I have been a Android\/Pixel user for the last 10+ years. I have been a committed Pixel user since its inception, experimenting with every app, accessory, watch, phone, etc. I also used Google Fi for five years.However, a recent incident has prompted me to reconsider my loyalty. The ongoing issue of network connectivity has been a source of frustration, and last week, a new problem arose: suddenly, my META apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook) could no longer access the phone's microphone. While in-app video recording has always been subpar compared to the phone's native camera, this specific issue was unprecedented. All the permissions are checked, no hardware issue and camera app records fine.After consulting various blogs and users facing similar difficulties, I contacted Google. Despite following all the suggested troubleshooting steps, including a factory reset after backing up my data, I encountered a significant setback. I forgot that my WhatsApp backup was encrypted. Consequently, after the reset, I was unable to restore my backup. After several unsuccessful attempts, WhatsApp automatically deleted all backups, causing me to lose precious memories, including voice clips from my late grandfather. And the issue continues. When I contacted Google about it I was recommended to take the phone to a private service center and they couldn't do anything.While I do not blame Google for WhatsApp\u2019s automatic deletion of backups or my own oversight, I am exhausted by the instability of pixel softwares, which can render a device virtually inoperable or constantly dependent on updates. It slows down so fast as well.I expected basic functionality from a smartphone, but recent models, especially since the Pixel 3xl, have been disappointing. The Pixel 6 was notably problematic and I had one replaced under the warranty and it seems this trend persists with newer models.Therefore, I am bidding farewell to the Pixel 7, Pixel Watch, and earbuds. After more than a decade, I am returning to Apple.To everyone else, please ensure your data and backups are secure. Despite my best efforts, the loss of a single WhatsApp backup erased many irreplaceable memories I dearly wish I could revisit.And to Google, I can't comprehend how unreliable your softwares and hardwares are for a company of your size. I would have been the last person to jump off the boat and even if I have done it that means so many more has already left you.",

The instructions below may help a bit but do not fix the problem. The real issue is Android's Doze Mode which is too aggressive and is delaying notifications. Doze Stopper seems to circumvent it.Are you getting delayed notifications on your phone? Try turning off the setting \"Adaptive Connectivity\" (under Network & internet in Android 14). I ~~think~~ thought that fixed it for me. Also check that \"Adaptive Battery\" and \"Battery Saver\" are off.Two months ago I [posted about getting delayed notifications](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1atgrmf\/pixel_8_delayed_notifications_is_there_a_fix\/); they'd only show up when I woke up the phone. A popular post, it keeps getting comments from people saying \"me too\". Thanks to a hint [in this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GooglePixel\/comments\/1bvtkz5\/comment\/ky3cg1r\/?context=3) I learned about the \"Adaptive Connectivity\" setting. I'd never heard of it before. But it was turned on; I turned it off and now 24 hours later my phone has been reliably getting notifications the moment they happen.As a bonus, I *think* this may have also fixed my problem with the weather lockscreen widget showing me in the wrong location. Sometimes I'd get weather for Los Angeles where my IP address is rather than Grass Valley, CA where my phone is. I'm less certain of it but it's plausible.It's not clear to me what Adaptive Connectivity is supposed to do, I can't find clear docs about it. I think it may be a Google Pixel only thing? A lot of web pages talk about it only in terms of cellular, 4G vs 5G. I'm on WiFi almost always and still had notification problems. I don't know what Adaptive Connectivity's intent is but my experience is in Android 14 it means \"break notifications\". My guess is it's some power saving setting that is having the effect of taking the phone offline.Note there's other phone settings that might cause delayed notifications. Adaptive Battery is the big one (I've always had it off). Battery Saver mode may disrupt notifications.Also individual apps all have battery settings. That used to be Unrestricted \/ Optimized \/ Restricted and my understanding is Optimized was supposed to let notifications through immediately. The [UI for all that just changed in Android 14 QPR2](https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2024\/03\/15\/android-14-qpr2-app-battery-usage\/) but I think it functions the same. Most of my apps are set to Optimized and are getting notifications on time.Bottom line: turn off Adaptive Connectivity and Adaptive Battery if you are having trouble with delayed notifications.*Edit Apr 7*: after a couple of days I think this change has improved things but not fixed them entirely. Notifications are still delayed sometimes (Gmail at least) but only by a few minutes, not 30+ minutes like it used to be.",

Android was still evolving and devices were very slow when they reach 1 year old, even the flagships after a year of updates, they became slow and start crashing, so every two years I felt like buying a new phone.After a while, I got tired of buying new flagship phones that didn't last long, and I bought some mid-range phones and they feel kind of crappy (but they had a 90Hz screen, something that even non-Pro iPhones don't have yet...)Well, a few years ago I switched completely to iPhone, but I never had smartwatches before, nor \"smart\" headphones, but today I do. When I decided to switch to iPhone it was to fully merge myself into its ecosystem, so I could understand it better... it is expensive! Today I use an iPhone 13, Apple Watch SE and AirPods Pro.The best \"iPhone-like\" ecosystem available in Brazil, I think is Samsung, but I don't like their phones, their interface and even their TV operating system, so I refuse to go for them. Motorola, I'm tired of them and I don't want them either.I also don't feel like replacing my iPhone 13 with a new iPhone, I only do basic stuff like YouTube, Reddit, CarPlay, Spotify\u2026 no gaming, and the 13 still seems fine for that kind of use. It just started to stutter sometimes due to battery health, I guess.I sometimes think about replacing it in the future and when the time comes I think I can use the money to buy a Pixel since iPhones are also expensive here.Are the features of the Pixel phones and Pixel watches similar as the iPhone ecosystem? Do they work well and stable and don't tend to slow down after a few years of use like Android devices used to? I miss being on Android and even though I'm familiar with the iPhone now, there are a lot of things I hate about the way they handle some things that feels much clearer and straightforward on Android...",

Now using an iPhone 13, Apple Watch SE, and AirPods Pro, they find Samsung's ecosystem less appealing despite its proximity.

I own an iPhone 14 Pro Max. Recently, I had to replace a Pixel 7 Pro due to a screen issue and a faulty charging port. This was the first issue on any of the 5 phones we've had in two years. \\[nb, I thought usb c was supposed to be superior to lightning but I think that has proven to be false IRL\\]I got a quote to repair the 7 pro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A technician at U break mentioned that Pixels rank last in durability among iPhone, Samsung, and Pixel. They quoted repairing the 7 Pro at $900, versus $260 currrent price (Feb 2025) for a refurbished one, making repair not economically viable.As a replacement, I bought a refurbished Pixel 8 Pro from Amazon for $414.00.\u00a0 Examining it, I found it fragile compared to the iPhone. It's lighter which I prefer, but seems a lot less durable.I prefer the Google OS over iOS and want to switch to a Pixel. However, its hard to move away from durability towards fragility.All this aside, there is one factor in favor of pixel fragility.\u00a0\u00a0 You can find refurbished Pixels cheaply, with a Pixel 7 Pro costing $279 vs an iPhone 14 Pro Max costing $650 renewed on Amazon as of Feb 2025. This makes replacing a broken Pixel far more affordable than an broken iPhone.\u00a0 Is this, after all, the reason why google does not even give 2 shits about building a durable phone?",

        "user_review":"My Frustrating Experience with the Pixel 9: A Cautionary Tale for Non-English Speakers.I was eagerly anticipating the Pixel 9, especially after all the hype about its AI capabilities. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen AI that could actually be useful in daily life, not just as a chatbot. But after just a few minutes of using the phone, I\u2019m already highly disappointed. None of the much-touted features are available in languages like Czech, which is frustrating considering this is the second generation of Pixels officially sold in the Czech Republic. Google's loud claims about AI being accessible in many languages worldwide just don\u2019t hold up here. At least Apple was quite clear about the availability of Apple Intelligence.Here\u2019s a breakdown:**Pixel Screenshots:**  The app opens, but it's entirely in English despite my system language being Czech. Even worse, the AI features aren\u2019t available because it says my system language isn't supported. It doesn't even specify which languages are supported, which is infuriating.**Pixel Studio:**  The app won\u2019t open unless you switch the language to English. Once you do, it functions, but prompts must be in English. This is far from the seamless, multilingual experience Google advertised.**Call Notes:**  This was the biggest letdown. Not only is it unsupported in Czech, but the feature doesn\u2019t even show up in the UI. The same goes for transcription, \"Hold for Me,\" and the ability to record calls. It\u2019s incredibly disappointing to see these features completely missing.**Gemini:**  While Gemini supports Czech (finally, something does!), it's basically just a web-based chatbot with no integration into the phone's ecosystem. There's no connection to Google Assistant, no weather reports, no calendar or Keep integration, and no smart home control. It\u2019s not even connected to the Search. When I asked about a major local fire, it claimed it couldn\u2019t search for it and it told me to use Google Search. Also, \"Hey Google\" isn\u2019t available. Gemini Live isn\u2019t either, but at least Google made it clear that this feature is US-only for now.**Magic Editor:**  This feature is essentially unchanged from the Pixel 8 series. You can ask the AI to fill in gaps in an image or modify the sky, but you can\u2019t write anything down because the option simply doesn\u2019t exist.**Pixel Weather:**  The app itself looks terrible\u2014no animations, an inaccurate weather map, and no AI summarization. It feels like an afterthought.**Other AI Features:**  No transcription or summarization in the Recorder app, and no text proofreading or style suggestions in Google Messages.Before anyone says that the Czech Republic is too small of a market to matter, keep in mind that Google has an official presence here, complete with a Google Store and booths in every electronics shop. If Google is going to spend hours hyping up AI features during they presentation,  they need to deliver\u2014or at least be transparent about the limitations. It\u2019s frustrating and misleading to pay the same premium price as US customers while receiving a fraction of the features. And for Pixel 8 Pro users, there\u2019s literally no reason to upgrade to the Pixel 9.Let this post serve as a warning for anyone who doesn\u2019t use a widely spoken language\u2014think twice before buying the Pixel 9.-Frustrated Pixel fan",

I am not sucked into any one ecosystem and, while I have a MacBook, I am not one of those that consider AirDrop this *integral feature that I cannot live without* like you find over at r\/Apple.\\*\\*\\*# iPhoneBasically, I have an iPhone 15 Pro. I purchased this when it came out in 2023 \u2014 after a few years using an Xperia \u2014 because I was so darn happy that Apple finally swapped to USB-C. *About damn time*. Better still, I even purchased 2-years of the full AppleCare coverage (incl. theft), that still has until Feb 2026 before it expires.This means, even though the device is battered and bruised, I really don't care about that and I can just use the phone while it still works \u2014 and works it still does! Even has the new Apple Intelligence features and all.And if I break it still in the meantime? Well, an \u00a380 excess fee and a day later I'll just have a new one. Fab.\\*\\*\\*# SamsungThe problem I have with Apple at the moment is the political climate.I am British \u2014 Apple is in the process of revoking E2EE cloud storage here in the UK. Not the end of the world, as I have that MacBook to back up locally like in the olden days. But I am also surprisingly charged by the current American administration.Appreciate the UK has been left out of the firing line (so far) but I am so appalled by the attacks on Europe, Canada, and now Ukraine that I kind of just want to purge all American devices from my property. Great excuse (albeit farfetched) for an early upgrade, too.So, I went ahead and bought an S25. Same storage level as my iPhone, size, and even -\u00a3100 off. I reckon if I sold the iPhone (with the AppleCare) I could even make a small profit as it's still highly sought after \u2014 the cost burden of juggling both these phones isn't the issue here.My last Samsung was an S22, and I really liked it (except the battery). We usually get Exynos here, but the S25 is SD \u2014 so I thought this is a killer phone to have right now, that should last.And yet ...I'm hesitating opening the box in its return period...\\*\\*\\*# My problemI'm stalling opening the Samsung mainly because of an upcoming trip to Japan \u2014 that just so happens to be on the last day of the return period. This device isn't insured, and so I am a little terrified of taking it abroad \u2014 breaking it \u2014 and then about -\u00a3699 out of pocket without that same insurance catchment I have if I broke the iPhone abroad at the moment.The other thing is that (as I suspect you might agree here) perhaps this was just a bit of a pointless purchase?Like, the iPhone's purchase was accounted for and customer by Apple in 2023. It's a spent product, and I am barely giving Apple any more money today by simply using it. I think maybe I'm just being petty about the Trump administration, especially as it's something so massively out of my control.I guess my question is, am I right to be hesitant about jumping on (what is) such a minimal upgrade, even if the hardware's Korean? Or is the S25 (with SD) actually millions times better than the iPhone I currently have?Appreciate any thoughts here.",

        "user_review":"Should i switch to iOS+AW?.Hello,I've been an Android user for 10 years. Currently, I have a Pixel 8 and a Pixel Watch 2. Let me highlight the points that are annoying me about Android and why I'm considering moving to iOS. I've had a few Samsungs in the past, but I don't like the bloatware and duplication of apps. I really like the vanilla experience and don't want to move to another brand within Android. For me, the only choices are Apple and Google.**Android cons:*** **Unlock:** Face Unlock is very convenient, but only when you are in a well-lit space. I have the PW2 configured to unlock using proximity, but sometimes it doesn't unlock and asks for the PIN. Additionally, when it does unlock with the PW2, the watch vibrates (and you cannot deactivate it). I think FaceID would be more convenient, but the only phones in Android that have it are from Honor, and as I said, I don't want to use any brand other than Google. Also, tilt to wake is a bit inconsistent for me.* **Watch:** Some features are behind a paywall. Recently, I went on a two-week trip and had inconsistent battery life. For instance, on two days, without any apparent reason, the battery drained in only 12 hours, while it usually lasts for 32 hours (I don't have AOD enabled). No permanent ECG reading. I think the Apple Watch offers a more polished experience. Tilt to wake is also a bit inconsistent.* **Battery:** It leaves much to be desired, even though I'm using the Android 15 beta.* **Lack of polishing in some apps:** The App Store has stricter rules than Android.* **Lack of design coherence.****iOS cons:*** Lack of a good voice assistant* Notifications are not as good as Android (but they seem to be improved in iOS 18)* The stock keyboard (and even Swiftkey or Gboard) is far behind compared to Android Gboard* No Revanced (I use Revanced for Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram)* No split screen* No background tasks* No Google Discover* No clipboard manager* No universal back gesture (and also, not having back gesture from both sides)* No possibility to drop down the notifications from the bottom like I have in Android (for one-handed usage)I'm also a heavy Google user (I have a lot of IoT peripherals in my home managed by Google Home: Nest Camera, Chromecast...). So why am I considering this? I have a MacBook Pro as a work computer, an iPad, and a Mac Mini as personal computers, and the integration is good (e.g., shared clipboard, which is even better in iOS 18).

        "user_review":"A Warning to All: The Perils of Relying on Your Apple ID!.I'm absolutely livid and at my wit's end here. My Apple ID was banned out of the blue, and the so-called \"senior advisor\" from Apple has been downright unhelpful. They claim it's due to \"sending suspicious messages,\" which is absurd\u2014I don't even use iMessage. Their vague accusations have left me in the lurch.I'm racking my brain here because the only thing I can think of is my daily use of a VPN, but it seems extreme for that to cause a ban. Could using a VPN daily be to blame? Since when does protecting your privacy lead to an account ban? It's outrageous! My Apple ID is a lifeline, with countless important accounts linked to it. And now, without any legitimate justification or even a warning, Apple's heavy-handed approach has cut off my access. No discussion, no appeal, nothing!What could be other possible reasons for this? Has anyone experienced something similar? I'm looking for any steps I can take because I have numerous accounts tied to my Apple ID, and it's incredibly inconvenient to have it banned without a proper explanation or a chance to secure my data.**Some updates:**After making some noise and pushing for answers, I was finally put in touch with an even more senior advisor at Apple. Their advice? Write a formal complaint letter.They've provided me with a mailing address to send a detailed grievance. It seems old school, but if it can help rectify this ridiculous situation, I'm all for it. I'm sharing this to let you know that there might be a sliver of hope if you find yourself in a similar predicament.**Now I feel lucky that I've never used Apple's Keychain or iCloud services to store my personal passwords and photos.  If your digital treasures matter to you, you should also use services that can easily diversify your backups.****Some new thoughts:**I later received an email from Apple saying, \"*Your account was closed in accordance with the iCloud Terms and Conditions. I\u2019m unable to provide further information about this case.* \" This contradicts what the advisor hinted at on the call (suspicious messages). I barely use iCloud, enabled EE2E and never used it for sharing or anything unusual. It appears even the support team is uncertain about the reason behind the deactivation as I am.Many people asked me if I sent some messages that could be reported. I really don't use any Apple services for messaging. I use many other third-party platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram. None of them belongs to Apple.Some other folks mentioned that my account might have been compromised due to a weak password. I'll admit it is possible, but part of the blame falls on Apple's frustrating policy that doesn't allow pasting into the password field for Apple ID. This essentially barred me from using a complex password generated from my password manager, forcing me to opt for something more memorable yet less secure. I did enable 2FA though.Another user shared his ban experience. His whole family accounts were banned because his credit card couldn't be used. He tried to link another card 7-8 times which triggered the fraud detection system. I remembered that I also tried to restore a purchase which I bought from r\/AppHookup for free previously, I guess somehow this made Apple feel suspicious (due to network issue or anything, idk).What's really concerning is the unique nature of an Apple ID. Unlike most other IDs, it's tied to so many important digital assets like passwords, photos, documents, wallets, emails and linked accounts. And because of Apple's closed ecosystem, backing up isn't so user-friendly.  Being banned without a chance to appeal or rescue the data feels like a nightmare because of the sheer amount of personal data at stake.  Let's all stay aware of how we manage our digital lives and take steps to protect our assets.**Updates 04\/08:**I just recalled another detail that might have raised Apple's suspicions. Occasionally, I've downloaded premium apps for free when they were promoted on r\/AppHookup. If I found an app wasn't useful, I sometimes uninstalled it right away but still left a 5-star review on the App Store. This hasn't been a regular habit\u2014I've done it with maybe 20 apps in total, never more than 5 in a single day.  However, even if it looks suspicious, it doesn't really breach the Terms of Service, and a permanent ban for such actions seems like an extreme measure, especially when it affects everything associated with my Apple ID, not just the App Store.**Updates 04\/09:**Previously I thought I could keep using my devices (iPhone\/iPad) even after the ban, but I've stumbled upon a major obstacle\u2014I'm unable to sign out of the banned Apple ID! It looks like I'm locked out unless I'm willing to factory reset and say goodbye to all my data. This is absurd!I contacted the senior support team again, and they told me I have to provide my purchase receipt and erase all data on the device to keep using it. Nonsense again. Since when did the owner of the hardware become Apple again? What if I can't find the receipt  which was 5 years ago? To be clear, no one reported my device was lost.**Final update here:**[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/1cdsqpf\/the\\_final\\_update\\_of\\_my\\_recent\\_apple\\_id\\_ban\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/1cdsqpf\/the_final_update_of_my_recent_apple_id_ban\/)**Some useful links:**[**https:\/\/www.apple.com\/au\/privacy\/contact\/**](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/au\/privacy\/contact\/)[https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2023\/08\/08\/another-user-locked-out-of-apple-account\/](https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2023\/08\/08\/another-user-locked-out-of-apple-account\/)[https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2021\/12\/07\/apple-accounts-permanently-blocked\/](https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2021\/12\/07\/apple-accounts-permanently-blocked\/)*I will keep this post updated!*",

New job kinda forced\/bullied me into must-having iOS... It sucks that way and I hate how I had to scrounge up the marketplace urgently for it (no they did not inform me about this and I had a TERRIBLE first day at the new job because of it).Ended up settling for both the iPad 9th gen and iPhone 8 for cheap. Like dirt cheap. The iPad was to be let go by a nice couple who wanted not a lot for it. It was still new too with limited warranty attached to it. Came with a bunch of cases and a new screen protector. Its not that difficult to say that the iPad 9th gen lives up to its reputation as one of the best tablets around. Its still a powerhouse for both work and play.The iPhone 8 was the cheapest though. Guy wanted nothing more to do with it but went and got it a new battery (with its age, I don't really care if its original, OEM or a generic cheap one). Its at 100% battery health for now. What surprised me was how good this thing is. On low power mode with about ~3 hours of SOT on social media, texts and calls... I come back home with about 70% charge. That's honestly insane. Multitasking is shit on it obviously with the tiny RAM but otherwise it runs modern apps really well minus the longer load times.For comparison, for a while I still used my Pixel 7a and Pixel 8 Pro alongside the iPhone during the work day. The 7a and iPhone have more or less the same SOT and workload but the Pixel always runs our of juice at the end of the day. Even when its on battery saver. It was absolutely no match. I still have to have the Pixel around because the iPhone 8's camera can't take anything worth shit for social media. Maybe the camera is defective by now but it is horrid. Its the only reason why I still have the Pixels with me during work. Otherwise, I think I would be perfectly fine to fully use the iPhone for work.If the new job pans out, I'm seriously considering an iPhone for a work phone next year. Either the SE4 for digital minimalism and work or try transitioning fully into the Apple ecosystem and get a full fledged Pro iPhone. That unless Google's rumored TSMC-fab Tensor G5 is worth something. Plus upcoming SoCs in the next year's Android flagships are not shaping confidence so far.",

        "test_user_journey":" Hello Reddit User!\n\nHere's a test user journey for the Gradual Alarm App that addresses your concern:\n\n1. **User Profile**: A smartphone user who has recently switched from Pixel to iPhone and misses the gradual increase in alarm volume feature available on their previous device.\n\n2. **Scenario**: The user is searching for a clock app that allows them to set an alarm with a gradually increasing volume without involving Apple's health features or bedtime schedule.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n\n   - **Step 1**: Download and install the Gradual Alarm App from the Apple App Store.\n   - **Step 2**: Open the app for the first time and grant necessary permissions, such as access to the device's media volume level and notification settings.\n   - **Step 3**: Navigate to the \"Alarms\" section within the app.\n   - **Step 4**: Tap on the \"+\" icon to create a new alarm.\n   - **Step 5**: Set the desired alarm time, days of the week the alarm should sound, and label the alarm for easy identification.\n   - **Step 6**: In the \"Volume\" section, configure the alarm to increase gradually over the set duration (e.g., from 20% to 100% in 5 minutes).\n   - **Step 7**: Optionally, customize other alarm settings like sound, repeats, and snooze options.\n   - **Step 8**: Save the newly created alarm and test it at a convenient time to verify its functionality.\n   - **Step 9**: If everything functions as expected, the user will have found a suitable solution for their problem.\n\n4. **Expected Results**: The Gradual Alarm App should allow users to create alarms that gradually increase in volume without requiring them to use Apple's health features or bedtime schedule. Additionally, the app should be easy to navigate and offer customizable options for alarm sounds, repeats, and snooze settings.\n\n5. **Test Cases**:\n   - Test Case 1: Verify that the alarm volume increases gradually as set by the user (increase rate, duration).\n   - Test Case 2: Verify that the alarm wakes up the user when it is supposed to (correct time and days of the week).\n   - Test Case 3: Verify that the customizable options for sounds, repeats, and snooze settings work as intended.\n   - Test Case 4: Verify that the app's interface is user-friendly and intuitive."
