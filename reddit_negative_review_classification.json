        "user_review":"80% of American teens buy iPhones. After I switched to Pixel, I'm convinced Samsung is why..People who've used iPhones and are hesitant to go to Android, often talk about the same few things:1) Android is clunky and hard to use.2) There's too much bloatware3) They're tired of ads and auto-installing appsAfter using a Pixel for the first time though, I've come to realize this thing is just as polished as my iPhone was. If not *more.* If anything, the above issues are almost exclusively *Samsung* issues.For example:1) **Clunkiness.**Android for a long time now has allowed the user to use navigation gestures. The average, non-techy user prefers this, and the average iPhone switcher *definitely* does too, considering it operates the same way their iPhone did.Keep in mind that most people typically never change the default settings. Why then, do Galaxy phones default to the clunky, old 3 button navigation bar, hiding the gesture bar under several deep menus? The average consumer *wants* the gesture bar, and so the Pixel (and hell, many other Android brands) use it by default.2) **Bloatware.**It's simply a fact that Samsung ships way too many apps on their devices. For almost every software service, there's a good chance you'll have three stock options: the Google app you want to use, the Samsung copy of that app you don't want to use, and a Microsoft app on there for some unknown reason. Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, Microsoft OneDrive. *Why*?The fact of the matter is, when the *average consumer* uses a phone and opens a file, they don't want to be bombarded with 3 different options. They want that file or that action to just *happen.* Seamlessly. If they *wanted* OneDrive or Word or Samsung Internet, they'd go download it.3) **Ads and auto-downloads.**By default, an **unlocked** Galaxy A-series will auto-downloads apps you never asked for occasionally. It will also feed you ads *in your notifications.* What's worse is that carrier-locked S and Z phones, the *flagship Galaxy devices*, will *still* do this. This is horrible for the user experience -- one should NEVER have to deal with being served an ad by their very own operating system, let alone *forced to install applications.* This is why Windows 11 is getting so much hate.--Compare all of this, to the Pixel. Or really, *any* stock Android phone. The Pixel's got a clean, simple interface with *one* design language, *one* ecosystem of apps, a fluid and easy to navigate gesture system, and *zero* inbuilt ads and auto-installers. *This* is what stock Android is, unbloated by Samsung and One UI. And it's an amazing experience.All these software issues the Galaxy series have, are bad enough on their own. However, combining them with this *one* extra fact, makes them significantly worse:**Galaxy phones outsell every other Android brand combined** in the US.The average American consumer will buy \"an Android\", end up with a Galaxy, and end up with an absolutely *terrible* user experience. What's next? They're not buying a Pixel or a OnePlus. Samsung *defines* \"an Android\" to them, and Samsung failed their needs.They're buying an iPhone afterward, and never looking back.iPhones have a **80% market share** among young Americans. And they're *growing.* The *only* competitor making a dent in that 20% is Samsung, and their *horrific* user experience hemorrhages market share to Apple every quarter.Samsung's strategy isn't working. The iPhone is pushing them to a breaking point, and the Pixel is growing in from the other side.",
        "summary":" The review highlights that after switching from an iPhone to a Pixel, the user found Android devices, specifically Samsung, to be clunky and burdened with bloatware and auto-installing apps compared to their polished and seamless experience on the Pixel. The user suggests that this is problematic because Samsung's Galaxy series dominates the US market, resulting in many consumers having a negative perception of Android phones and gravitating towards iPhones instead."

        "user_review":"Long Post Ahead \u2013 My Honest and Complete Experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL as a Longtime iPhone User.Hey everyone, I wanted to share my full and honest experience with the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be a long post, but I hope it gives valuable insight, especially coming from someone who has been an exclusive iPhone user since the iPhone 4 and 4S. This is my very first experience with a Pixel (and Android in general).# Why I Bought the Pixel 9 Pro XLI usually upgrade my phone every two years, but this year, the iPhone 16 Pro Max didn\u2019t feel like a meaningful upgrade from my 14 Pro Max\u2014at least not enough to justify the cost. So, I decided to finally give Android a shot, and I wanted to enter through what many consider the best and purest Android experience: the Pixel lineup.# Main Reason for Choosing the Pixel: The CameraI\u2019m a professional photographer, and I mainly shoot with Sony cameras and my iPhone for casual use. This time, I wanted to break my usual pattern and see if the Pixel could replace my iPhone as my go-to mobile photography device. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been quite disappointed due to several software restrictions\u2014especially around using the camera outside of the default Google Camera app (I\u2019ve made a separate post about this issue).# Software Experience: Just \"Good,\" But Not ExceptionalThe Android experience on the Pixel is fine\u2014it gets the job done. But nothing has convinced me to fully switch from my iPhone. I still use my iPhone as my primary device while trying to integrate the Pixel more and more into my daily life.Some features I really liked:* The ability to long-press the navigation bar and instantly search anything on my screen.* The automatic song recognition feature, which detects music playing around me.* Gemini AI is promising, but it constantly gets confused between Google Assistant and Gemini when I give voice commands.# Fingerprint and Face Unlock* **Fingerprint Sensor:** Excellent. Works fast and reliably with no issues.* **Face Unlock:** Unreliable to the point that I completely ignore it and just use the fingerprint sensor instead. I don\u2019t have anything covering the camera or affecting it, yet Face Unlock consistently struggles or is too slow to be useful.# Camera: My Biggest DisappointmentDespite the Pixel's strong reputation for mobile photography, my experience has been frustrating. The camera is great *only* in excellent lighting conditions, and mainly for still photos.# Issues I Faced:1. **Excessive smoothing and processing** \u2013 Images often look unnatural due to aggressive software processing, even in RAW. When I open RAW files in Lightroom, they appear overly soft and lose critical details.2. **Depth of field issues** \u2013 The default depth of field is so shallow that only a small part of the image remains in focus, and even AI adjustments can\u2019t fully correct it.3. **Limitations on third-party apps** \u2013 8K video recording and 50MP RAW photos are only available in the Google Camera app. Third-party apps are limited to 4K video and 12MP photos, which is frustrating for professional use.4. **Lens switching in video mode is terrible** \u2013 When switching between lenses while recording, there's an obvious cut and disruption, making transitions very unprofessional. The only way to avoid this is to lock the lens before recording, but that limits zoom capabilities and lowers video quality.5. **Auto white balance is unreliable** \u2013 It constantly shifts in real-time while recording, forcing me to set it manually every time.6. **Portrait mode looks artificial** \u2013 The background blur looks overly processed and unnatural.7. **Low-light performance is extremely poor** \u2013 Even with Night Sight, the results are disappointing. If I stabilize the phone and use Night Mode, the results improve slightly, but they are still far from what I expected.Most of these issues weren\u2019t present on my iPhone, even though I\u2019ve gone through every setting and tried full manual controls. No matter what I change, the post-processing ruins my shots. This is incredibly frustrating because the camera was the main reason I bought this phone.# App Store & Software EcosystemI also noticed that many apps on the Play Store are slightly more expensive than their iOS versions, even though Google takes a smaller revenue cut from developers compared to Apple. In theory, Android apps should be cheaper, not more expensive. Additionally, app quality feels more inconsistent\u2014many apps seem to come from smaller developers and are loaded with ads rather than offering a polished user experience like on iOS.# Final Thoughts After 3 Months of Daily UseI want to be clear: I\u2019m not an Apple fanboy trying to hate on the Pixel. In fact, I *want* to switch, and I\u2019ve been actively trying to make the Pixel my primary phone. But after three months of daily use, the experience hasn\u2019t lived up to my expectations.I\u2019m genuinely wondering:* Am I missing something? Are there settings or tweaks I should try to fix the camera issues?* Is there any way to improve the bad image processing?* Has anyone found a fix for third-party camera limitations?I always keep my software and apps updated, but nothing has improved these issues so far. **I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and input\u2014especially from those who have switched from iPhone to Pixel. Is there something I\u2019m overlooking?**\\*Edit 1 : More context I wanted to follow up on my camera experience with the\u00a0**Pixel 9 Pro XL**, specifically regarding\u00a0**RAW photo processing**.I\u2019ve been noticing a major issue when editing RAW photos in\u00a0**Lightroom**\u2014they look significantly different from how they appear in Google Photos. There\u2019s a\u00a0**huge loss of detail, aggressive noise reduction, and softening**, making the RAW files almost unusable for proper editing.I\u2019ve attached\u00a0**two images of the same RAW file**\u00a0to show what I mean:\ud83d\udcf8\u00a0**Comparison Images**:  [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BdOOOty)1\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**First image**\u00a0\u2192 RAW viewed in Google Photos (looks relatively fine).  2\ufe0f\u20e3\u00a0**Second image**\u00a0\u2192 The exact same RAW file opened in Lightroom (before any edits).# The Issue:* When opening the RAW file in\u00a0**Lightroom**, it looks\u00a0**significantly worse**, with\u00a0**excessive smoothing and loss of sharpness**.* This happens\u00a0**before applying any adjustments**, so it\u2019s not an issue with my editing.* It feels like\u00a0**Google is still applying some kind of processing or compression to RAW files**, which defeats the purpose of shooting RAW in the first place.# Questions:* **Is this a known issue with Pixel RAW processing?*** **Is there a way to get true, unprocessed RAW files for editing?*** **Anyone else experiencing this with Lightroom or other editing apps?**I\u2019d really appreciate any input from other Pixel users, especially photographers. I want to get the most out of this camera, but this has been a frustrating limitation. Let me know if you have any insights!  ",

        "user_review":"Farewell to Pixel after a decade! I am done with unstable unreliable software..I am moving away from Google and transition to Apple, despite the substantial cost involved in switching ecosystems and given I have been a Android\/Pixel user for the last 10+ years. I have been a committed Pixel user since its inception, experimenting with every app, accessory, watch, phone, etc. I also used Google Fi for five years.However, a recent incident has prompted me to reconsider my loyalty. The ongoing issue of network connectivity has been a source of frustration, and last week, a new problem arose: suddenly, my META apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook) could no longer access the phone's microphone. While in-app video recording has always been subpar compared to the phone's native camera, this specific issue was unprecedented. All the permissions are checked, no hardware issue and camera app records fine.After consulting various blogs and users facing similar difficulties, I contacted Google. Despite following all the suggested troubleshooting steps, including a factory reset after backing up my data, I encountered a significant setback. I forgot that my WhatsApp backup was encrypted. Consequently, after the reset, I was unable to restore my backup. After several unsuccessful attempts, WhatsApp automatically deleted all backups, causing me to lose precious memories, including voice clips from my late grandfather. And the issue continues. When I contacted Google about it I was recommended to take the phone to a private service center and they couldn't do anything.While I do not blame Google for WhatsApp\u2019s automatic deletion of backups or my own oversight, I am exhausted by the instability of pixel softwares, which can render a device virtually inoperable or constantly dependent on updates. It slows down so fast as well.I expected basic functionality from a smartphone, but recent models, especially since the Pixel 3xl, have been disappointing. The Pixel 6 was notably problematic and I had one replaced under the warranty and it seems this trend persists with newer models.Therefore, I am bidding farewell to the Pixel 7, Pixel Watch, and earbuds. After more than a decade, I am returning to Apple.To everyone else, please ensure your data and backups are secure. Despite my best efforts, the loss of a single WhatsApp backup erased many irreplaceable memories I dearly wish I could revisit.And to Google, I can't comprehend how unreliable your softwares and hardwares are for a company of your size. I would have been the last person to jump off the boat and even if I have done it that means so many more has already left you.",

Frustrated by these problems and the slow performance of recent models, they are switching to Apple, despite the financial investment required. The review serves as a cautionary tale to secure data backups to prevent similar losses."

I hate the fact that I have to scroll through a thousand photos to find something to show to a potential client or current client and I remember back when I had a note 7, that it was much easier to organize albums and keep everything in check. However, I also do vaguely remember that android phones weren't optimized the best for social media apps like Instagram which I primarily use to advertise which is why I switched to Apple in the first place. I don't really care much for the whole Apple ecosystem. What draws me towards the Pixel and from what I've been reading is the Camera quality. I use an external CPL filter for some of my photos\/videos to remove unnecessary glare and I was wondering if anyone has any experience using a filter on their Pixel, if it works well or if it ruins some of the quality? How much of a difference would there be in terms of posting videos\/photos to Instagram in quality? Is it noticeable or pretty much the same thing at this point? Also how does the pixel organize photos? Are you able to transfer them into folders or do they still all stay in a \"recently taken\" album even if you move them around?

        "user_review":"Broken in 5 Days (Pixel 9 Fold).I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others.

        "user_review":"Broken in 5 Days (Pixel 9 Fold).I want to speak on my experience with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, spoiler alert it was terrible.Let me start off by saying that I wanted this phone to work so bad. I've been on iPhone since 2015 and I was a softmore in high school. I was tired of Apple and the iPhone 16's big innovation of just a camera button pissed me off beyond belief. I started researching Android offerings in 2024. I was on a 13 Pro Max and didn't really know what else has been on the market since the Galaxy Note 3 l had in 2015.  I followed the newly announced Pixel 9 Series and saw the 9 Pro Fold and I instantly knew that was the one. I conducted all of my research and finally pulled the trigger on November 19th. I placed the order from T-Mobile and the phone arrived on the 21st.Adapting to Android was a little different and my family were complaining due to the group chat issues (even with RCS). However, I was satisfied. The front screen being the size of a normal Pixel was impressive and I found myself using that more than in a folded state. The heaviest use my phone gets is YouTube since I'm always listening to something.This past Tuesday November 26th (THE FIFTH DAY OF USE!!), I open the screen as normal and may I say that I am not aggressive with opening, I did not drop the phone, I simply opened gently like you would with a phone like this. I instantly noticed a cracking type sound and the screen cracked down the center fold right before my eyes. A black blob slowly taking over. I thought I was just seeing things so I closed it. When I was slowly opening it the second time the phone was creaking and cracking even further. I was at a loss for words. The photo posted was what I saw after those two folds.Fast forward to calling T-Mobile. I'll save you the long, repetitive, and poor excuse for policies that they told me about. Long story short since there is physical damage, they cannot take the product back. A defective device with a screen that is rated for a 100,000 folds (or whatever crazy number) breaks and I'm SOL. Buyers remorse does not cover it. 15 day return does not cover it. They told me the only option was for me to find someone to replace the screen and return it to them before 14 days of original purchase. This would be near impossible with the holiday and the  phone needing such niche parts. They would not look any further into it and refused to assist me with a product that is obviously suffering from a manufacturers defect.Google's assistance was technically better because they offered a local screen repair or shipping it back to either repair or replace. Either way I'd be out of a phone for an indefinite period of time, since local repair will not have that screen for weeks. Google could possibly be quicker with 7-10 days but I\u2019d still be phoneless. I was so disappointed and scared about the poor quality of this phone that all I wanted to do was go back to iPhone.After the terrible service and answers from T mobile I eventually started the path of asking every customer service associate's supervisor until I got to someone who could actually assist. I did not want to have to go through legal channels to get this sorted and I made it very clear that if they could not assist then that was the route I\u2019d have take. Surprise surprise I was transferred to a supervisor local to my area. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a common issue with foldables and that there is no consumer protection.She is following our case and set me up for a return and refund. I went back to t-mobile and got the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I guess I\u2019ll be a part of the Apple machine until I die, I guess. I know android is good for a lot of people but it was a smack in the face for my first time back in 9 years. Yes, I could have gotten a replacement but I no longer trust this technology. My step dad has had a Samsung Fold 3 for a year and half and that has been good to him. I know other folds are good to others. I've seen similar posts on the 9 Pro Folds here but they had a lot more time before the screen gave in. I wanted to tell my experience to those looking into this device",

        "user_review":"Pixel 8a video issue.Hi! I\u2019ve noticed something weird about my Pixel 8a's video quality, and I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.For context, I\u2019ve used a lot of phones across different operating systems and specs in the past. This is my first Google phone, but I try to be unbiased when comparing devices in general (eg: iOS vs android and all that). Overall, I love my Pixel 8a, and I\u2019m seriously considering sticking with Google phones. However, there\u2019s one thing that keeps bothering and that's video quality.Photo processing is solid. It\u2019s not perfect, but for everyday shots, it\u2019s great. When I need more control, I shoot RAW in Lightroom anyway.Video quality, especially in low light is really disappointing. I know that all phone video has grain and artifacts, but what I\u2019m seeing  here is different. It\u2019s not just grain, it\u2019s unstable color noise with massive, ugly artifacts that start to show up as soon as the lighting gets tricky.This isn\u2019t a case of the sensor not being capable, I've seen less powerful phones handle low light video better. It feels like a quirk with the processing pipeline. Changing resolution or frame rate doesn\u2019t help, the videos still end up looking like they were shot on a phone from a decade ago.The example stills of videos are shot in dark conditions, sure, and might seem exaggerated, but I don't know, I'd expect them to just be dark and slightly grainy, not like THIS. I\u2019m curious if others have run into the same issue. Am I just crazy or overreacting?",

        "user_review":"I regret buying an iPhone.I\u2019ve regretted buying an iPhone (iPhone 13) for the past seven months now. Before that, I had a Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. I bought it because I had always used Android (from different brands) and wanted a change. At the time, no Android phone really appealed to me, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to try something different. That\u2019s how I ended up getting a refurbished iPhone 13.Here\u2019s what disappointed me:\t\u2022\tFirst thing: I bought it in pink, but it actually looks more white than pink (not a big deal, but still).\t\u2022\tI almost always keep my phone on silent since I spend most of my time in class or at work, and I find the notification system absolutely terrible. There\u2019s no small icon at the top of the screen, and notifications barely show up on the lock screen, so I have to manually check for them multiple times a day. Because of that, I sometimes receive messages and completely forget to reply.\t\u2022\tI don\u2019t understand why my home screen wallpaper is blurry. I don\u2019t want it to be blurry, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to fix it in the settings. Either way, I shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings just to correct something like this.\t\u2022\tWhen I turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, why does it only stay off until the next day before turning itself back on?? I get that maybe it\u2019s to prevent unnecessary data usage, and sure, maybe I could change this in the settings, but I don\u2019t want to constantly mess around in the settings for basic things like this!\t\u2022\tWhen I watch a YouTube video in landscape mode while lying in bed, the screen doesn\u2019t automatically rotate. I have to exit fullscreen and reopen it for the orientation to be correct.\t\u2022\tHonestly, I thought I\u2019d get used to it, but I hate swiping to go back. When I\u2019m watching slideshows on TikTok, it\u2019s annoying to have to stretch my hand all the way to the edge of the screen just to go back\u2014it\u2019s just not practical.\t\u2022\tIn general, there are so many restrictions on what I can do, and I constantly feel like the phone is preventing me from using it how I want.\t\u2022\tThe mute switch on the left side: I find it super impractical. I have to fidget with it to know if my phone is on silent, and sometimes there\u2019s a delay (though I wonder if that\u2019s because my phone is refurbished and maybe the switch is faulty).\t\u2022\tTo adjust notification or alarm volume, I have to go back to the home screen because if an app is open, I can\u2019t adjust the system volume directly.\t\u2022\tFace ID: I don\u2019t know if mine is buggy, but a friend who has always used iPhones tried it and said it was normal, so I guess that\u2019s just how it works. But personally, I find it super slow; sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, and when I\u2019m lying down, it doesn\u2019t always recognize me. I had to make a Reddit post complaining about Face ID just for someone to tell me that when unlocking my phone, I could tap \u201cFace ID\u201d to enter my passcode faster. Like\u2026 it\u2019s written nowhere that I could do that. How was I supposed to guess??\t\u2022\tThe photos honestly aren\u2019t that impressive. I compared them to my 2018 Galaxy S8, and while they\u2019re decent quality, they\u2019re nothing incredible. In fact, I find them a bit dull.\t\u2022\tThere are no numbers displayed at the top of my keyboard.\t\u2022\tWhen I log into something and receive an SMS code, I have to tap on it manually to autofill it, whereas even my 2018 Galaxy S8 did this automatically. (Okay, maybe I\u2019m nitpicking here, but still.)\t\u2022\tTo turn off my phone, I have to press the power button AND volume up at the same time. The first time, I had to ask a friend for help because I just couldn\u2019t figure it out. I mean, if there\u2019s a power button, logically, holding it should turn the phone off.\t\u2022\tThe default calculator app is garbage, right? I\u2019m a waitress, and I use my phone\u2019s calculator to count my cash register at the end of the night. Who thought it was a good idea to remove the calculation history?? I don\u2019t get it. They want the phone to be so sleek and minimalist that it actually becomes unusable. I had to download a separate calculator app, which is just ridiculous.\t\u2022\tWhen someone calls me, there\u2019s no direct \u201cDecline\u201d button on the screen. Again, not a big deal, but I find it inconvenient.\t\u2022\tThe phone gets scratched super easily. When I first got it, I had to use it for two days without a case because mine hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Despite being careful, the metal edges already got scratched, and I have no idea how.\t\u2022\tThe snooze lasts 9 minutes??\t\u2022\tWriting and editing text on an iPhone is unnecessarily complicated.\t\u2022\tI can\u2019t close all my browser tabs at once.I know that a lot of these issues can probably be fixed in the settings, but:\t1.\tI shouldn\u2019t have to dig through settings for things that, to me, should be basic.\t2.\tA brand-new iPhone is ridiculously expensive. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t buy the latest model, because for the price, this phone should be reading my mind.To give you an idea: in the first month, I was so disappointed compared to everything iPhone fans had told me that I actually went to an Apple Store to check if my phone was even real.I know I\u2019m complaining about a lot of little things, and maybe I\u2019m just used to Android, which makes some things stand out more. But considering the insane price of an iPhone, I feel like I have every right to nitpick.Anyway, I think I\u2019ll sell my phone this summer. (I hate doing that; I\u2019ve always used my phones until they were completely broken.) But I just can\u2019t see myself keeping it. I\u2019ll get something else instead.Edit: I also want to say that I don\u2019t like not being able to place my app icons on the home screen wherever I want. I don\u2019t get it\u2014the phone costs an entire month\u2019s salary. If I\u2019m paying that much and I want a page with a big empty space in the middle with no apps, I should have the right to do that, right??

        "user_review":"When will Android overcome some of its long-standing problems?.Hi all, I'm going to first say that I have been an iPhone user since 2012.  The last time I had an Android phone as a daily driver was back in the 2.3 days, but I have watched Android's progress over the last few years and frequently use friends\/coworkers' Android devices, including an Android tablet running on 5.1 that I have.I have to say that I'm both awed and incredibly frustrated with Android because it seems that a lot of the problems that existed when I left.  I really *want* to like Android.  I really *want* to consider it seriously instead of going after an iPhone year after year.  I like iPhone and iOS, and it works well with my MBP, but I like choices and right now it feels like I have to make too many concessions to seriously consider Android again.  I got burned with a lot of early devices so perhaps I'm jaded, so I'll put this out to you guys to get your take on the following issues I have.1.  Carrier customization - this is probably the biggest problem I have with Android - each carrier feels some burning desire to muck with the OS, adding in apps you don't want or need, removing functionality that was built-in to Android in favor of their own apps that either force you to pay extra for them, or provide inferior user experience.  I've also seen cases where some features are disabled entirely, or hardware is tweaked (some carrier versions come with less memory, etc), so that the same phone is a tad different on each of the carriers.2.  Manufacturer Customization - the burning desire of each manufacturer to much with the stock OS as a differentiator.  Why can't they make this configurable, where you can enable TouchWiz or Sense or whatever, or go back to Stock experience.. especially so those customizations could be updated independently of the OS.3.  Lack of updates - Because of #1 and #2, updates to the OS are hard to come by, they are delayed months if not years, and sometimes you don't get them at all, especially if it's a major version upgrade because both carriers and manufacturers want to entice you to buy new phones more often.  The updates frequently have major bugs in them and this sends people running to root their phone or install custom OS4.  Lack of updates - unless you buy a Google phone, and they can't seem to get this right.  From carrier exclusivity and lack of expandable storage (Pixel, I'm looking at you), to the historically poor hardware support across the board for most Google devices.5.  Comparatively poor security - because of #1, #2, and #3 above, most people are not up to date and have serious if not critical security patches that are needed on their phones.  You can't patch these yourself unless you root your phone and install custom OS, but that opens the door to new problems.6.  Custom OS's can be incredibly useful and cool, but requires constant upgrading and tweaking to get it running smoothly.  Back when I used to do this with Cyanogenmod I was flashing my phone at least 1-2x a week and so I would lose time getting it back to good, and also would frequently have to reboot.  It felt like I could either live with the limitations of the carrier firmware or deal with the instability of custom firmware.7.  Because of all the fragmentation with hardware, software, etc the quality of the apps seems to suffer and there are many versions of apps targeted at various DPI ranges.Has there been progress made towards any of these things, and maybe I'm just not seeing it?  Are these things even considered problems anymore?  It seems like it's as bad or worse than when I left the ecosystem.  It feels like manufacturers and carriers alike have run amuck trying to distinguish themselves to the detriment of the end user.  I find myself wishing there could be a balance between the walled garden that Apple provides and the free-for-all that Android provides.  I wish that Android forced guidelines to manufacturing and software implementation such that fragmentation could be reduced, apps would run smoother and without as much effort on the devs side to make it so, and that you could keep the stock Android experience intact with all its customizations and keep the carrier stuff and manufacturer skins optional.",

        "user_review":"An Android user using iPhone 14 Pro Max for almost 2 years. My thoughts and experience.I've been using Android practically my whole life. I used mainly Samsung but I've used HTC, Lenovo and Huawei myself too but my last phone is Samsung S20 Ultra. I broke my phone for the most embarrassing reasons why I'm not gonna get into so I decided to try iPhone for the first time since iPhone 3G. I bought the greatest of the great 14 Pro Max. Here are my pros and cons:Pros: - Software optimization is very good. Most apps work beautifully compared to Android. It feels so seamless- OS support is good and I rest easy knowing I can use this phone for a good 5 years before switching - It's a beautiful phoneCons:- No volume mixer. It's by far the most egregious thing. I use it religiously in my Samsung and to not have this is fucking horrible. A switch button to silent or turn the ring on is fucking pointless- Keyboard is straight shit. Dog shit. Horrible. Really Apple? A Keyboard that is so horribly dated that I need to use third party kb but it's still horribly buggy because you keep forcing me back to your shit keyboard?- Camera is meh. Night mode really shows how bad it can be. My friend's S23 Ultra night made embarrassed my 14 Pro Max camera- Lightning port lol. The fact that it took the EU to finally force them to use something superior is laughable. - No colored edge lighting but a horrible brind flash to notify you that you got a notification but you'll have to guess- No customization in my phone and me not being able to use apk file is terrible- Picture organization is terrible. I cannot move said file to this album because at the end, they're always still in the Recent albums - Apple trying to shove their iCloud service at me almost dailyThere's more but in short, fuck Apple and fuck their iPhone. I refuse to be trapped into their ecosystem so once another 3 years have passed, I'm going back to Android. It feels like I'm holding a last generation phone hiding behind a mask of a next generation smartphone.",
        "summary":" The user, an experienced Android user who has been using the iPhone 14 Pro Max for two years, offers a mixed review. They praise the software optimization and longevity of the OS, but criticize the lack of volume mixer control, poor keyboard functionality, subpar camera performance (especially in low light), outdated design choices such as the Lightning port, limited customization options, and poor photo organization features. Despite these issues, they plan to return to Android after three more years due to feelings of being trapped within Apple's ecosystem."

        "user_review":"I Hate How Apple Has Normalized Their Absurd Pricing.As you may know, Apple released their M3 series chips about a month ago, and on a surface-level, they're impressive. The M3 Max smashes in basically every benchmark in performance and efficiency, and the M3 is a substantial upgrade over M2 and M1. But that's just looking at a surface level. Even not taking into account the insidious anti-consumer and anti-repair policies Apple practices, a concerning amount of people, even tech-enthusiasts, seem to completely turn a blind eye to the absurd and greedy pricing that Apple uses on their Macs. The even worse thing is, by normalizing these absurd prices, they embolden other manufacturers to do the same, increasing prices across the board even for someone not looking for Apple products. &#x200B;One of the reasons why I started thinking about this was when I saw this chart floating around of Geekerwan benchmarking the M3 Max on Baldurs Gate 3. A lot of people were talking about how impressive it was that a M3 Max was keeping up with an i9 + 4080 PC:&#x200B;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d0yzswjaxp5c1.png?width=2528&format=png&auto=webp&s=a554f11e2e351cea40b894339ebff05c75360929But so many people fail to mention how much more \\*expensive\\* the M3 Max is compared to most PCs. 4080 Laptops like the Legion 7i often can be found for $2-2.5k, whilst the M3 Max with the full 40 core GPU goes for a whopping **\\*$4000\\*.** It's absolutely insane how people give Apple a pass by comparing two tiers of product that are not even in the same league price-wise. And of course, people go to defend the Mac by arguing over things like efficiency\/power-consumption. But let me ask you this: just how much electricity are you using so that you are making up a $2k deficit?I've also seen people try to justify their pricing by comparing them to business-class workstations like Dell Precisions or Lenovo Thinkpads. But the fact of the matter is, Macs are NOT enterprise-class machines, they're simply upsold consumer products. Enterprise machines often come with certified drivers to run professional programs like Solidworks, this plus their multi-year long support\/warranty is often what makes them so expensive. Apple's GPUs are very limited in terms of professional support compared to, for example, Nvidia's Quadro GPUs. The even worse thing is, when looking at their more \"budget\" offerings (quotes because nothing Apple sells is budget), this issue becomes much more apparent. One of Apple's most absurd decisions was to release the M3 Macbook base model with only 8 GB of RAM. Apple tried to defend it by arguing about how \"8 GB is enough\", or that it was a \"base model\". People also try to point out that some PC laptops have 8 GB RAM. This kind of argument makes sense when you're talking about $200-300 bargain bin laptops. But there are 0 PC products really being sold at a whopping \\***$1600\\*** price point with 8 GB of RAM. The fact that Apple successfully duped people into believing that selling a $1.6k laptop as a base model with insufficient RAM is okay is absolutely ridiculous. No other company could pull something like that off. The M3 Pro is another example of Apple's shameless greed and upselling strategy. At \\***$2000**\\*, you'd expect a product that has close to no compromises, but that's not the case at all. Apple purposefully hampered the chip by reducing its performance and GPU core count in order to try to force people to spend even more money for the Max. When you pay $2000 for a PC, even a laptop but especially a desktop, you're pretty much getting close to the best performance out there. You can get a good i7 and RTX 4080, with graphics performance that would crush the M3 Pro. But to Apple's eyes, $2k isn't even enough for the full M3 Pro, you get a binned version. This reminds me of also discourse surrounding the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip. I've seen arguments that \"M3 killed it before it arrived\" which is completely blind to the cost of products that will probably be using this chip. A lot of these arguments point out that the X Elite loses to the M3 Max in Geekbench\/Cinebench, and need I point out that again that that aforementioned M3 Max costs $4000? I feel like Apple and Apple customers live in another world, where money doesn't matter- as long as it's an Apple product. That's the thing too: it's not even just that they're rich and don't care about money; Tech reviewers will complain about how the 4090 costs $1.6k (which is definitely a valid complaint) but then turn a blind eye to the $2k computer with a deliberately hampered chip, designed to upsell you to a $4k computer. It's hypocrisy- where for Apple pricing doesn't matter but all of a sudden for everyone else, pricing does. I'm just tired at how stingy and greedy Apple's pricing is, and how brightly their \"no amount of money is enough\" attitude shines through their deliberate hampering of products to get you to pay that extra hundred or thousand dollars more. And like I said, this attitude rubs off on other manufacturers. They may not be able to price as egregiously as Apple, but Nvidia's 40-series GPUs were priced much higher than their 30-series and also had their performance hampered by low memory bus width and low VRAM, most likely because they saw what Apple did and thought \"hey, they got away with it, we will too\".This is exactly why I don't respect Apple for competition- Apple's style of competition is not a competition for lower prices and attracting consumers, it's exactly the opposite: one where they compete to see how much money they can extract from oblivious consumers.

        "summary":" In this review, the author criticizes Apple for its exorbitant pricing on their Macs, particularly the M3 series, comparing them unfavorably to PC alternatives. They argue that while the M3 chips are impressive, their high cost is not justified, especially when compared to similarly-performing PCs at much lower prices. The author also criticizes Apple for their lack of professional support and insufficient RAM options in their base models. Ultimately, they express disappointment in Apple's pricing strategy, which they claim encourages other manufacturers to raise their own prices as well."
