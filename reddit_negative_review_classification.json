The linked picture is representative of the issue I've ran into a few times now. I read up about a screen grounding issue that Google has recognized and issued an extended warranty for. My phone does qualify for this. I went to a local repair shop and got a different story. When I was at the repair shop the screen was not messing up. The repair tech said that he suspected it was water damage and if he investigated further he'd likely destroy my screen and it would either be covered by warranty or is owe him 250$ for a new screen. Needless to say I walked out without any destructive troubleshooting by him. Any input on what's going on?

Overheating, scrolling frame rate drop, camera app crashing. Sometimes I think the fingerprint scanner just doesn't want to work some days.

We just arrived in the US from Canada for a vacation and are completely unable to connect our phones with Android Auto to rental cars. We have tried 4 different rental cars, 3 brands (Ford, Nissan, and Dodge), and BOTH of our phones. We can pair our phones to the cars, but Android Auto does NOT work - either over Bluetooth or wired. My phone was connected via Android Auto to my BWM i4 at home before the Android 15 update, and was still working afterwards. My wife has a Tesla, so her phone has never been used with Android Auto since the update or before. I have tried over and over, with Bluetooth on and off. I just had to go and buy a windshield mount for our phones as we can't use the vehicle screens. Not ideal when we spent so much on new phones. Does ANYONE have a solution or any ideas? I have tried resetting Bluetooth, removing all connected Android Auto vehicles and trying again and again. When we first arrived last night, my wife's phone worked for an hour or so, long enough to get to our condo, but as of this AM, nothing.","11":"I'm a complete idiot\/ Pixel 9 Pro XL+This is the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.

I tried to check but I didn't see any this post would offend. My Google Pixel 8 started have display issues in December, I sat on sending it in for repair due to the holidays and the fact that I'm on call for work about 4 times a week. My issues started with edges of screen getting really green and turned into a solid green line up and down the phone. I sent it in for a replacement and it arrived on 01\/13\/25, I waited for them to receive it and send me a new phone for 4 business days before I contacted support. They said that they were on it and to wait 24-48 hours and I'd be sent a new phone. I waited the two business days and nothing changed at all. I then contacted support again and tried to get someone to help me (Now a week without my phone) but was told the same thing again that it would take 24-48 hours for a different team to look into it. When I protested and said that I couldn't be without my phone for much longer, that I'm required to be on call at work, they said \"Sorry that's all I can do\". When I asked to speak to a higher level up I was told \"You're going to get the same answer out of them\". So that's it I'll never buy a google phone again. Not that google will probably care much, or that anybody really cares. Its just that this whole experience has been INCREDIBLY frustrating for me so I feel like I have to do something.

After changing the search provider, the search bar's icon is updated to reflect the user's choice of provider. The user can go to the Pixel Launcher's settings then tap \"home screen search settings\" and finally \"search engine\" to change the search provider afterwards.This is starting to roll out to users in Europe and comes as the DMA recently went into effect. Google announced last week that users in the EEA will see \"additional choice screens\" including one for selecting a default search engine when setting up a new Android device.Here are some screenshots: [1](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GIvIx-GWIAA10v3?format=jpg&name=large) [2](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GIvIzCvWkAAEM47?format=jpg&name=large) [3](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GIvI0cuWEAAunRb?format=jpg&name=large) [4](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/GIvI2m4X0AAVsrl?format=jpg&name=large)","50":"Finally got a Desktop Mode working!!+Thanks to the new version of scrcpy and Android 15!
